        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am having trouble finding some general information on this subject. I know I am down the rabbit hole when google doesn't have an answer.
 I want to know best practices and information on using clusters for machine learning with large amounts of data. I believe I have a close to an optimal solution but wanted to get some other opinions on the subject.
 My current setup:
  
AWS EKS Kubernetes for a cluster
 Kubeflow for ML platform
 Katib for HPT jobs
 Pytorch for custom models
 Spot instance GPUs
 Lustre for file serving to the models
  
My Data:
  
Millions of Images stored in S3
 ~50TB of data
  
What is the most efficient way to move my data to the cluster?
 My current approach:
  
Preprocess the data with a dedicated instance and store it in S3
 Master runs on a dedicated node
 Katib spins up a set number of GPU spot nodes
 A claim is made, and an FSx Lustre system is generated for the pod
 Advantages: Very fast training and data movement with spot training
 Disadvantages: I have to spin up several Lustre systems for the training
 Preprocess the data with a dedicated instance and store it in S3
  
Possible alternative
  
Same as above but use EFS as a distributed file system so I don't have to wait for Lustre
 Advantages: Potentially cheaper as I have only one FS
 Disadvantages: Slow throughput, read this was a bad idea
 Master runs on a dedicated node
  
Other alternatives
  
UseKatib spins up a PyTorch streaming function with S3(boosted transfer speed)set number of GPU spot nodes
 Every pod starts a claim is made and downloads data to an EBS
 Give up and switch to SageMakerFSx Lustre system is generated for the pod
  
Anyone with experience in these technologies I would really appreciate hearing your thoughts.

 model = Sequential() model.add(Dense(10000, input_dim=212207, kernel_initializer='normal', activation='relu')) model.add(Dense(100, activation='relu')) model.add(Dense(1, kernel_initializer='normal')) model.compile(loss='mean_squared_error', optimizer='adam') for i in range(10000000): #X is input with 212207 values #Y is a output value if i<6000000: model.fit(X.transpose(), Y, epochs=30, batch_size=1, verbose=0) else: prediction=model.predict(X.transpose()) 
 I made sure that I am training on different examples and trying predictions on different examples. I am still getting the same prediction value for all testing inputs. I think I made some mistake in defining the model for regression neural network. Can you please check if the code is correct?

Form-based document understanding is a growing research topic because of its practical potential for automatically converting unstructured text data into structured information to gain insight about a document’s contents. Recent sequence modeling, which is a self-attention mechanism that directly models relationships between all words in a selection of text, has demonstrated state-of-the-art performance on natural language tasks. A natural approach to handle form document understanding tasks is to first serialize the form documents (usually in a left-to-right, top-to-bottom fashion) and then apply state-of-the-art sequence models to them.  
 However, form documents often have more complex layouts …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey everyone,
 I've recently started working on a task allocation problem using RL. I'd just like to make sure my thinking is correct on how to best approach the problem. 
 At the moment, we have (effectively) a graph traversal sim for n number of agents, where the goal is to minimize the total distance over an episode, as determined by setting the correct tasks. The task supplied to each agent will determine the route that is taken, and therefore the distance. 
 The current idea is to supply an input graph that also contains information on the current location of the agents. A second input would be the set of available tasks. The expected output would be done through a pointer network, where we produce a reordered set of the tasks in descending order of optimality. 
 When step is called, the sim runs until a new task is needed (agent completes it's route). 
 ​
 In general, does anyone know a good way to represent the inputs and output of this problem? A pointer network seems like it could work to produce actions, but if I need to do a forward pass for every agent, it seems that there would be no consideration of other agents when determining tasks (We shouldn't have 2 agents doing the same task). For the graph representation, a graph nn seems like an obvious choice, but I just wanted to see if anyone had any insight on why they may or may not be used.

 Programmatic — an NLP annotation tool for building large labeled datasets for NLP without manual annotation
 Programmatic is like a REPL for data annotation. You:
 1. Write simple rules/functions that can approximately label the data 2. Get near-instant feedback across your entire corpus 3. Iterate and improve your rules 
 Finally, it uses a Bayesian label model [1] to convert these noisy annotations into a single, large, clean dataset, which you can then use for training machine learning models. You can programmatically label millions of datapoints in the time taken to hand-label hundreds.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There are many projects promoting in this sub, you may like or dislike. And if any of my posts you dislike, allow me to apologize first.
 However, it gets me to think. Several years ago I'm a moderator in a quite large forum, because I don't have enough time to fulfill my responsibilities, then I decided to retire (yes, they can, and I remained as the vip user which only retired moderators can be).
 This is a large community, a machine learning community. Besides continuously removing some of these posts, and no clear rules on it, can we do any better? We got all the data, and we just cannot train the model?
 Here are my three proposal, and please give some excellent ideas besides my poor ones:
  
Self promoting post should have values other than itself, and not having annoying contents
 Self promoting project can be used as a tool in a non self promoting posts, as long as the posts creates valuable contents and the promoting is not obvious and annoying.
 Depends on the number of new project posts, Weekly/Daily project post can be created by moderator and pinned to the top. All the promoting content goes into the comment. We can explore and upvotes.
  
Here are some illustrations:
 1. Direct Promoting Post
 ​
 2. Indirect Promoting Post
 ​
 Weekly/Daily Promoting Post by Moderator, Pinned to Top, Comments by project owner, upvotes/downvotes by us
 Which do you think is acceptable? Or you have better ideas? Leave a comment.
 It's a machine learning sub, don't make machine to solve it better than us.

 https://github.com/remifan/commplax
 I have a research article as a use case demo, https://remifan.github.io/gdbp_study/article.html
 This tool essentially
  
implements adaptive DSP equalizers as stateful NN layers (thanks to Jax's explicit stateful syntax)
 implements compositor interfaces from scratch to wrap up those stateful layers with other regular NN layers so that they can be trained together
  
Homebrew serial compositions of stateful layers
 It is a fun project for me and I feel JAX really elegantly fits this research use.
 What do you think about JAX? I appreciate your comments:)

End-user can tweak widgets values and execute the notebook. The resulting notebook can be downloaded as single-file HTML. Simple.
 The framework is built on Django+React. It is easy to deploy to Heroku or other cloud services. Recently, I made it possible to deploy it to Hugging Face Spaces (faster and larger machines than on free tier Heroku). 
 The process of deployment is simple. You need to create a Gradio app on Spaces (my framework is not supported, yet ;) ). You need to add the app.py file that will run the Mercury server and upload the notebook. You can check the details in the docs.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I read a paper and was a little bit confused:
 In the paper it said: "Imagine you have a two dimensional (binary input) classification (0 or 1) problem and you use Sigmoid as an acitivation function. Since the Sigmoid gives you a real number between 0 and 1, it's not really classification anymore. 
 Therefore you take the input of Sigmoid (y_Sigmoid) and put this into a modified heaviside function H(y-0.5) (so for y_Sigmoid bigger than 0.5, it gives you yHeavi = 1)
 The decision boundary is given by a straight line w1a1+w2a2+w0=0 and this whole process, it only works with the Sigmoid function as first activation function."
 The last paragraph confused me. Why can I assume that the decision boundary is exactly that (It's just the "normal decision boundary" for a SLP, why does it work here a also) 
 and why does it work with only Sigmoid Function as first activation function

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I would like to test the architecture from the following paper with a different dataset:
 https://www.mdpi.com/2072-4292/13/19/3834
 The authors state that their objective function is the following:
 https://preview.redd.it/u78f27jb6nu81.png?width=1027&format=png&auto=webp&s=32790a67ec829a1e79b252edd0714b8b3b5a7f4e
 Where:
 -x is the real grayscale image.
 -s is its downsampled version, which should be used both as the initial imput of the generator performing the super-resolution and as a first conditional variable in the learning process.
 -e is another two-dimensional array containing values for a second additional conditional variable.
 The authors, however, state that this should be implemented by using two separate conditional adversarial losses, one for each of the conditional variables. To clarify, the first adversarial loss should be:
 AdvLoss1(ParametersG, ParametersD) = - Log(Discriminator(x,s) - Log(1-Discriminator(Generator(s),s)
 While the second would be:
 AdvLoss2(ParametersG, ParametersD) = - Log(Discriminator(x,e) - Log(1-Discriminator(Generator(s),e)
 Which should be then summed up for the backward pass.
 In my pytorch implementation, however, I have only been able to set up a unique adversarial loss, which could be defined as:
 CurrentAdvLoss(ParametersG, ParametersD) = - Log(Discriminator(x,(s,e)) - Log(1-Discriminator(Generator(s),(s,e)) I have tried to implement implemented as follows:(simplified version)
 which I calculate in the following training loop (simplified version, from the same question asked in the Pytorch forum) as errD and errG after conditioning the network on both s and e at the same time:
 https://discuss.pytorch.org/t/conditional-gan-with-multiple-adversarial-losses/149627
 My question is, is there a way to modify the following loop to obtain outputs that have been separately conditioned only first on s and then on e and thus calculate the two separate adversarial losses originally proposed by the authors instead?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have a dataset of points cloud where each point in the point cloud has a variable. I am trying to relate the local geometry features to that point variable by using FPFH, This means I am generating my own features from the dataset by first using an area of n-points to compute normal-vector estimations and from x normal vector estimations to compute the FPFH. However, the numbers x and n are arbitrary and other combinations might describe the target variable better. So I wanted to know if there was a method to evaluate how good a given x and n value are at describing the target variable. I considered the correlation between the features (n,x) and the target variable but I read that this assumes linear combination redundancy. I am using scikit-learn. 
 So basically I have features X(x,n) and a target variable Y. Which x and n, in the feature space X(x,n), describes the target variable, Y, best.
 I want to do it before the training because when I try to train it with my random forest regressor it takes 3-4 hours and I want to test for more combinations.

 Abstract
 Deep learning frameworks are the engines and motors for pushing the boundaries of artificial intelligence applications, and good deep learning frameworks can dramatically shorten the cycle of algorithm innovation and validation. In this report, we focus on the newly launched MindSpore framework, which has received a lot of industry attention, and systematically explore its model training speed on GPU clusters and compare it with popular international frameworks. In the evaluation experiments, we choose two classical models, ResNet and BERT-base, to test and analyze their performance with the same algorithm, the same dataset, and the same or similar performance hardware platf…]]></summary>

 The algo is smart and simple, but it's generation result seems more incredible than GANs, and its speed is fast, the model size is not too big: https://openai.com/dall-e-2/ , https://huggingface.co/spaces/multimodalart/latentdiffusion, https://www.reddit.com/r/dalle2
 So 1st question:
 why is diffusion model so powerful? Can someone explain it?
 2st question:
 Has anyone used diffusion for NLP?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am looking to build a new PC but have struggled to find the info on how Intel's latest CPUs perform for data science/ML, so if anyone is using one for that purpose and can help with one or more of these questions it would be very helpful! Apologies if these questions should be directed elsewhere.
  
I am planning to use WSL2/Ubuntu but have heard that Intel's thread director isn't implemented well yet in Linux (or Windows 10!), so it doesn't assign tasks properly. Has anyone experienced issues with this firsthand?
 Assuming the thread director is working, are the e-cores utilised at all in any typical DS workflows? E.g. will they get used with joblib or when training scikit-learn/gbms in parallel? 
 Are the e-cores good enough to handle other stuff like web browsing etc whilst the p-cores are maxed out on model training, or is it still necessary to keep at least one p-core free to avoid crashing the PC? Also I have read that in Windows 11 (where the thread director works best) that the active window/tab could be assigned p-cores as a priority, which isn't very helpful for someone who needs to train models in the background etc, but not sure whether this is actually happening in practice.
  
The consensus from benchmarks/reviews is that the hybrid architecture 'just works' and is superior to AMD right now, but those benchmarks are primarily for use in gaming/video editing.

 I hope you have a great day! Currently I want to compare how good multiple GANs (Vanilla GAN, WGAN, DCGAN, ...) are for a given use case. Therefore I trained the various GAN versions with data of two different classes (i.e. apple and banana). Now I want to show that data I generate with the Generator can be used to train i.e. a classifier that can distinguish between real images of apples and bananas.
 Can I somehow create labels for the data I generate with the Generator in a smart way? So that I know that a generated image of the generator should for example be an apple? How do i do that?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Any reinforcement learning problem can be modeled as a sequential decision problem (SDP), which can always be modeled as a Markov decision process (need to model the state carefully). An example of an SDP is a multiarmed bandit problem, where the state is the vector of beliefs about the performance of each arm (or beliefs about a continuous parametric model). Decisions are made by a policy, and there are four classes of policies. For some reason, the RL community tends to focus on just one of the four classes (UCB policies, which fall in the class of cost function approximations), but there are entire communities using each of the other three classes. See chapter 7 of my new book (https://castlelab.princeton.edu/RLSO/) for a complete summary of the four classes of policies for pure learning problems (aka bandit problems). Note that Sutton and Barto (2nd edition) cover bandit problems in chapter 2, and then introduce MDPs in chapter 3. A bandit problem *is* an MDP!

So far, I know there is toptal, upwork, and freelancers. Checked them out, and seems toptal you still end up working for large corporate and mostly end up as full-time contractor which is not really a different or better option than my current work. Freelancers has too many bidders from developing countries. 
 Besides what platform to use, i have more questions in terms of what obstacles we are facing to be freelancer ML engineer? Even though i am in AI and a researcher, but i have never deployed a model in production. Usually a task at big company takes a team or multiple teams to complete the MLOPs lifecycle, how can you do it as a single person? Any sharing of experience would be of great help.

Supervised learning is a common approach to machine learning (ML) in which the model is trained using data that is labeled appropriately for the task at hand. Ordinary supervised learning trains on independent and identically distributed (IID) data, where all training examples are sampled from a fixed set of classes, and the model has access to these examples throughout the entire training phase. In contrast, continual learning tackles the problem of training a single model on changing data distributions where different classification tasks are presented sequentially.

 I am a student from Germany writing my master thesis on Digital Transformation in ASEAN with AI/ML.
 For my thesis I would like to interview AI/ML experts from the ASEAN region to talk about the digital development of each country, challenges and potentials. (If you are not native there, but you have a work connection or just knowledge about the region and its AI development, I appreciate that as well.)
 It would be awesome if some of you were open to talk to me. A few sentences are enough, I won't take much of your time. If you want, we can do a video call as well. I will quote you of course.
 Thank you guys.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm trying to find literature on solving the following issue:
 In most probabilistic ML models, we model the joint distribution over a set of random variables, p(x1, ..., xN). If N is very large (e.g. 100, 500, or even 1000), then regardless of how you model this, the distribution's highest point of density is still quite tiny. E.g. if you consider an isotropic multivariate gaussian of 100 dimensions, the highest point of density will be somewhere in the neighbourhood of 1.6e-40. So when it comes time to evaluate log likelihood for a model like this, the probability is numerically 0, so the log probability goes to negative infinity.
 ​
 Is there work around solving these kinds of issues? I.e. by constraining the model in some way, or scaling model output, etc? I've done some googling, but am having a hard time finding papers on the subject. Not even sure what to call the problem... Curse of dimensionality in PGMs?
 ​
 Any recommendations of papers / talks / etc is greatly appreciated!

 Abstract:
 We present a framework for training GANs with explicit control over generated facial images. We are able to control the generated image by settings exact attributes such as age, pose, expression, etc. Most approaches for manipulating GAN-generated images achieve partial control by leveraging the latent space disentanglement properties, obtained implicitly after standard GAN training. Such methods are able to change the relative intensity of certain attributes, but not explicitly set their values. Recently proposed methods, designed for explicit control over human faces, harness morphable 3D face models (3DMM) to allow fine-grained control capabilities in GANs. Unlike these methods, our control is not constrained to 3DMM parameters and is extendable beyond the domain of human faces. Using contrastive learning, we obtain GANs with an explicitly disentangled latent space. This disentanglement is utilized to train control-encoders mapping human-interpretable inputs to suitable latent vectors, thus allowing explicit control. In the domain of human faces we demonstrate control over identity, age, pose, expression, hair color and illumination. We also demonstrate control capabilities of our framework in the domains of painted portraits and dog image generation. We demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance both qualitatively and quantitatively.

 On the other hand, i wasnt able to find information about the funding and profit goals of the leading conferences. Take NeuroIPS for example, i found that it is organized by “NeurIPS Foundation” but what exactly is this foundation - i couldn’t find any information about this subject.
 My point is, if the conferences are non-profit, sounds like they should be preferred over funding a for-profit organizations.

However, the interesting part for me is the link to the real world: Is there a way to directly implement any learned policy on a real drone, e.g. a commercially available quad-copter? Which UAV would support such a functionality?
 I'd love to get started on training drones for RL purposes (search and rescue, etc), but if there is no way to test it in real-life then this would be disappointing.

 For off-policy Expected Sarsa I believe it's possible to use one epsilon value for a target policy that is epsilon-greedy and another epsilon value for a behaviour policy that is epsilon-greedy. The target policy would be used within the expected value calculation in the update of Q(S,A), the action value function, and the behaviour policy would be used to choose actions from the current state. But I'm not sure how to differentiate between the control version of the algorithm compared to the prediction version though.
 I think prediction usually finds the state-value function but I know that on-line Sarsa for prediction uses Q(S,A) so I'm not sure how to determine the difference between prediction and control algorithms.

From that they get good scores on the one they trained on, but bad ones for the rest.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello there, I am working on missile command game, and as a baseline I mostly use rllib/ppo. The algorithm never converges, I suspect it is because of the lack of exploration. Since the timesteps are small, the target usually oscillates around center of the screen, it is impossible to explore to go near the border and then explore to fire (to counter incoming missile). What methods should I try?
 Moreover, I have already done reward scaling and frame staking. Any suggestions regarding solving this game is much appreciated. 
 Last question, do you now similar (and common) environments that is solved, maybe solutions show the path to follow.Thank you :)

It focussed on Neural Networks and gave some brilliant examples of environmental sensing. There was also a section showing a simple voice synthesiser which "babbled" like a child.
 I thought it may have been an "Horizon" show, however, I have been through the list of shows from that time and none appear to be right. If anyone has a memory of this show please let me know.
 One of the visuals I remember was a plastic skull with an LED matrix inside showing patterns. Obviously this was just some smoke and mirrors, however, it may trigger a memory. I'm trying to recall something from best part of 30 years ago..

 Dataset - Our custom dataset on Bangla Numerals
 Publications - Though its on (0-9) digits
 We have created a simple speech recognition system for recognizing Bangla numerals from '০-৯৯'(0-99). In this project, audio samples from different genders, age groups, and dialects of Bangladeshi people were used to create a speech dataset of spoken numbers from '০-৯৯'(0-99). The raw speech data is subjected to various audio augmentation techniques such as time shift, speed tuning, background noise mixing, and volume tuning. Then, to extract meaningful features from the data, Mel Frequency Cepstrum Coefficients (MFCCs) are used. We have used, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), to develop a Bangla number recognition system. The proposed method recognizes '০-৯৯'(0-99) Bangla spoken numbers with 89.61% accuracy across the entire dataset. The model’s effectiveness was also tested using 10-fold cross-validation, with 89.74% accuracy for recognizing '০-৯৯'(0-99) Bangla spoken numbers across the entire dataset.
 I Hope, this work will help you in some way. :)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Specifically, I'm talking about workshops of major conferences (NeurIPS, ICLR, ICML, etc.).
 If I submit a paper and it gets accepted, is that workshop paper a "final publication"? Or would most people expect the project to continue being developed into a slightly larger/longer paper for submission to the main stream of a conference? And if so, does publishing the earlier workshop paper tend to hinder or harm the later conference submission?
 I recognise there's a variety of workshops, and perhaps each have different expectations or norms. I'm wondering, from my outsider's perspective, how can I tell?
 For example, I have been thinking about submitting to one of these ICML workshops: https://icml-compbio.github.io/ or https://www.tagds.com/workshops/tag-in-machine-learning. Is there an easy way to tell whether either or both of these are "final publication" venues or not?

 This paper out today seems to make the bold claim that maximum likelihood estimation is not a well-posed training objective in deep generative modelling. The manifold hypothesis says that observed high-dimensional data clusters around low-dimensional manifolds, but maximum likelihood methods (e.g. VAE, normalizing flows) learn high-dimensional densities. The paper argues that the mismatch between dimensionalities will lead to a problem called "manifold overfitting".
 Models are able to maximize likelihood in high-dimensions by sending the density to infinity around the low-dimensional manifold, but they can do this while completely ignoring the distribution of data on the manifold. So in other words, high capacity models will learn the data manifold…]]></summary>

 I see this question was asked before but I am still not convinced there is a difference between the two. 
 How is asynchronous distributed RL (A3C) and federated learning different? It seems like the basic idea behind them is the same— the agents train in their own environments and only share gradients with the server. 
 Is the difference only in terms of the domain they are applied in? Is it just ML vs RL?

 So I intend to make an application that, very naively speaking, outputs synonyms of a given word regardless of context (like if word1 is "bank", the model should output both "money" and "river", and the order does not matter). For this, I intend to use a Doc2Vec type of classifier, where the meanings of each word can serve as a document, and then similar words can easily be returned using a cosine similarity function. I chose this over a classic Word2Vec as this will be able to predict uncommon words (which blimey the English language has a lot of) which would otherwise be processed as <UNK> tokens. To this end, I am searching for a suitable dataset. Any ideas?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This is the problem area I am working with: 
 I have a series of videos taken at different times, and each video is paired with a physical variable. The videos contain information that correlates with the physical variable. 
 What we want to do is use the information encoded within each video to build a correlation model with the physical quantity, and thereafter use new videos to predict the physical quantity. 
 (We want to avoid the route of video -> CNN -> extract parameters -> build model with parameters. Instead, we want to directly go from the videos to the model without separately extracting parameters.)
 So, in a way, I want to use a series of videos as a time series data set. Is there a way to do this? What should be the starting point for my research into this?
 Thanks in advance! I am not an expert with this area at all, and would greatly appreciate guidance from the community.

Conveniently, AutoRF doesn't mention SinNeRF. What are the similarities and differences among the two approaches? DISCLAIMER - I'm not a NeRF expert. My limited understanding of it is that we train a small MLP to regress the radiance field for a scene, i.e., to predict emitted radiance at a point (x,y,z) in the viewing direction (θ, φ). Once we have the radiance field, we can use some rendering engine to render a 2D view from the 3D field and the camera parameters.
 EDIT: I just realized that I didn't link the papers, how silly of me. Here they are:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey everyone!
 Our NLP team, led by our expert Daria, has recently released a new AI-based paraphrasing feature – Linguix Paraphraser 2.0.
 To measure its quality, we use four important metrics: BLEU, Jaccard similarity index, LaBSE and Perplexity.
 Performance stats:
  
BLEU, which is used for measuring the quality of machine translation. The lower it is for rephrase task, the better. Right now, Linguix Paraphraser 2.0 has the BLEU metric of 0.47 (previous iteration had 0.65). So, we can say that our paraphraser is now smarter, it uses more words to rewrite the sentence, but the overall idea of the content is still preserved.
 Jaccard similarity index is used to measure the likeness of x and y objects. The same as with BLEU, the lower the index for the task, the better. Our current metric is 0.45 compared to 0.51 for the previous iteration.
 LaBSE metric is used to measure the semantic similarity of two sentences. It translates text into vectors so that vectors of texts close in meaning are geometrically close to each other. The higher the metric, the better. The new model has LaBSE similarity slightly less than the previous model: 0.80 vs 0.93, which is normal and correct, because the model generates a variety of variants using other words, but keeping the meaning of the source text in the target.
 Perplexity is used to ensure the rewritten content sounds natural (lower perplexity is better). The naturalness of the rewrites generated by our new paraphraser is much better than before: 0.26 vs 4.99 for the prior version.
  
​
 https://i.redd.it/iaaf7o2iibu81.gif
 As such, for Linguix Paraphraser 2.0 we were able to improve the quality of the rephrased content, while keeping the text meaning at the same level.
 P.S. Daria is somewhat shy, so I asked her to share the update here on her behalf.
 Anyway she'll be pleased to see some feedback!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all - I'm an applied ML researcher working in an oncology research lab at U Chicago, using digital slides of patient's tumors for tumor classification, prognostication, and treatment response prediction. I'm really excited to share with the community the deep learning tools we've been using, and I'm hoping for any feedback you might have (or direction if you think there's a community or subreddit this might be better suited for).
 After years of development, we've released our open-source deep learning framework for digital histology, Slideflow (https://github.com/jamesdolezal/slideflow). It has flexible and highly optimized whole-slide image processing, support for a wide variety of existing and custom architectures (with continuous, categorical, or time-series outcomes), real-time digital stain normalization, a number of explainability tools, and integrated uncertainty quantification. It's compatible with both Tensorflow and PyTorch, available on PyPI and DockerHub, and comes with good documentation (https://slideflow.dev/). We've tried out a number of alternative frameworks over the years, and I think the ease of use, flexibility, and performance optimizations set it apart from other repos you'll find on GitHub.
 We have a handful of local collaborators who are using Slideflow, but I'm hoping to expand our reach and find people in similar fields who are interested in collaborating for ongoing open-source development. I've tried looked for subs relating specifically to computational pathology / digital histology, and haven't found a good community yet - anyone have ideas for how to get connected with like-minded people working in the same field?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey all, I have received a task in an area I am unfamiliar with and need a little help finding suitable papers, so I am looking for keywords.
 To illustrate the goal, let's say you have 10000 screws (which can be of the same model) and you want to be able to recognize/match each one. You want new screws to be added all the time, so you also want the case that the object could previously be unknown when performing the match.
 The goal is to develop a capturing system that produces suitable images and to find an architecture/algorithm that is as robust as possible. The object images should be invariant to illumination, rotation and translation during acquisition.
 It should be a kind of barcode/hash without any additional symbol, based only on the structure of the object.
 Is there a name for such a task? I think it is not really a classification in the classical sense. I guess it might be just a clever way of finding suitable features for each individual object structure and suitable distance function.
 Sorry for the long post, I appreciate any help.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello there, Which layer or structure would you append to existing machine learning architectures like yolov5 in order to not only detect the specific object, but also the object which it is part of? Lets say there are xray images of laptops: The laptop itself will be detected and also something like the hard drive or battery inside of it. Is it possible to make the CNN/RNN aware of the fact that the hard drive or battery is inside the Laptop?
 Hope someone can tell what i mean. Regards David

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have been offered a PhD in domain of knowledge representation and reasoning for autonomous agents. Goal is to use represent textual rules and world knowledge and then use those represented knowledge for reasoning, so that motion of autonomous agent can be predicted. 
 I have question regarding the current landscape of knowledge representation and reasoning. I see more and more work in data focused model and old Logic and associated paths fading out. Phd project problem itself looks interesting as it focus on work where there will be less need of data and can plan motion in unseen scenarios. But I am concerned about the future career prospective in this domain where this problem is tackled by knowledge representation and reasoning. As I can see there is less and less funding in this domain. 
 What is your take on future landscape of research direction in this domain?

This article illustrates a state-of-the-art model called DGHL for anomaly detection. DGHL includes a ConvNet as a Generator and instead of encoding it maximizes the likelihood with the Alternating Back-Propagation algorithms.

 AI is all about matrix multiplications, right? So why use the word tensor instead? I know what a tensor is, kind of. But isn't AI about matrix multiplications primarily rather than tensor multiplications.

 Summary:
 We introduce a novel statistical framework for learning a mixture of local normalizing flows as "chart maps" over the data manifold. Our framework augments the expressivity of recent approaches while preserving the signature property of normalizing flows, that they admit exact density evaluation. We learn a suitable atlas of charts for the data manifold via a vector quantized auto-encoder (VQ-AE) and the distributions over them using a conditional flow. We validate experimentally that our probabilistic framework enables existing approaches to better model data distributions over complex manifolds.​

 See step 15 here: https://spinningup.openai.com/en/latest/algorithms/sac.html#pseudocode
 I've heard this called polyak averaging.
 Let's say we have two weights from two neural networks: W1 from one network, and W2 is the corresponding weight from the other network. Polyak averaging averages these weights as follows:
 W_average = W1 * p + W2 * (1-p)
 When p is 0.5, it's a evenly weighted average. If p is high, then W1 is weighted more heavily than W2, etc.
 My question is: Does this method of averaging weights lead to numerically unstable neural networks? This technique is often used to gradually transform one neural network into another on a weight by weight basis, but there is no guarantee that all intermediate neural networks are well behaved (at least, none that I'm aware of). Whereas, gradient descent with small enough step sizes should, theoretically, keep a neural network well behaved, I think those same theoretical guarantees apply to polyak averaging neural networks.
 What do you think?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In this paper, we investigated whether we can 1) detect participants with
ataxia-specific gait characteristics (risk-prediction), and 2) assess severity
of ataxia from gait (severity-assessment) using computer vision. We created a
dataset of 155 videos from 89 participants, 24 controls and 65 diagnosed with
(or are pre-manifest) spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs), performing the gait task
of the Scale for the Assessment and Rating of Ataxia (SARA) from 11 medical
sites located in 8 different states across the United States. We develop a
computer vision pipeline to detect, track, and separate out the participants
from their surroundings and construct several features from their body pose
coordinates to capture gait characteristics like step width, step length,
swing, stability, speed, etc. Our risk-prediction model achieves 83.06%
accuracy and an 80.23% F1 score. Similarly, our severity-assessment model
achieves a mean absolute error (MAE) score of 0.6225 and a Pearson's
correlation coefficient score of 0.7268. Our models still performed
competitively when evaluated on data from sites not used during training.
Furthermore, through feature importance analysis, we found that our models
associate wider steps, decreased walking speed, and increased instability with
greater ataxia severity, which is consistent with previously established
clinical knowledge. Our models create possibilities for remote ataxia
assessment in non-clinical settings in the future, which could significantly
improve accessibility of ataxia care. Furthermore, our underlying dataset was
assembled from a geographically diverse cohort, highlighting its potential to
further increase equity. The code used in this study is open to the public, and
the anonymized body pose landmark dataset is also available upon request.]]></summary>

explore a new method for unconditional image-text pair generation. We propose
MXQ-VAE, a vector quantization method for multimodal image-text representation.
MXQ-VAE accepts a paired image and text as input, and learns a joint quantized
representation space, so that the image-text pair can be converted to a
sequence of unified indices. Then we can use autoregressive generative models
to model the joint image-text representation, and even perform unconditional
image-text pair generation. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our
approach effectively generates semantically consistent image-text pair and also
enhances meaningful alignment between image and text.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Online review systems are the primary means through which many businesses
seek to build the brand and spread their messages. Prior research studying the
effects of online reviews has been mainly focused on a single numerical cause,
e.g., ratings or sentiment scores. We argue that such notions of causes entail
three key limitations: they solely consider the effects of single numerical
causes and ignore different effects of multiple aspects -- e.g., Food, Service
-- embedded in the textual reviews; they assume the absence of hidden
confounders in observational studies, e.g., consumers' personal preferences;
and they overlook the indirect effects of numerical causes that can potentially
cancel out the effect of textual reviews on business revenue. We thereby
propose an alternative perspective to this single-cause-based effect estimation
of online reviews: in the presence of hidden confounders, we consider
multi-aspect textual reviews, particularly, their total effects on business
revenue and direct effects with the numerical cause -- ratings -- being the
mediator. We draw on recent advances in machine learning and causal inference
to together estimate the hidden confounders and causal effects. We present
empirical evaluations using real-world examples to discuss the importance and
implications of differentiating the multi-aspect effects in strategizing
business operations.]]></summary>

Second, a trainable edge enhancement filter was incorporated to detect and

adapts to an increasing number of tasks encountered sequentially, thereby
potentially leveraging learnings across tasks in a resource-efficient manner. A
major challenge for CL systems is catastrophic forgetting, where earlier tasks
are forgotten while learning a new task. To address this, replay-based CL
approaches maintain and repeatedly retrain on a small buffer of data selected
across encountered tasks. We propose Gradient Coreset Replay (GCR), a novel
strategy for replay buffer selection and update using a carefully designed
optimization criterion. Specifically, we select and maintain a "coreset" that
closely approximates the gradient of all the data seen so far with respect to
current model parameters, and discuss key strategies needed for its effective
application to the continual learning setting. We show significant gains (2%-4%
absolute) over the state-of-the-art in the well-studied offline continual
learning setting. Our findings also effectively transfer to online / streaming
CL settings, showing upto 5% gains over existing approaches. Finally, we
demonstrate the value of supervised contrastive loss for continual learning,
which yields a cumulative gain of up to 5% accuracy when combined with our
subset selection strategy.]]></summary>

non-convex problems. An important technique for acceleration is step-size
adaptation. The first part of this paper contains a detailed review of
step-size adaptation methods, including Polyak step-size, L4, LossGrad, Adam,
IDBD, and Hypergradient descent, and the relation of step-size adaptation to
meta-gradient methods. In the second part of this paper, we propose a new class
of methods of accelerating gradient descent that have some distinctiveness from
existing techniques. The new methods, which we call {\em step-size planning},
use the {\em update experience} to learn an improved way of updating the
parameters. The methods organize the experience into $K$ steps away from each
other to facilitate planning. From the past experience, our planning algorithm,
Csawg, learns a step-size model which is a form of multi-step machine that
predicts future updates. We extends Csawg to applying step-size planning
multiple steps, which leads to further speedup. We discuss and highlight the
projection power of the diagonal-matrix step-size for future large scale
applications. We show for a convex problem, our methods can surpass the
convergence rate of Nesterov's accelerated gradient, $1 - \sqrt{\mu/L}$, where
$\mu, L$ are the strongly convex factor of the loss function $F$ and the
Lipschitz constant of $F'$, which is the theoretical limit for the convergence
rate of first-order methods. On the well-known non-convex Rosenbrock function,
our planning methods achieve zero error below 500 gradient evaluations, while
gradient descent takes about 10000 gradient evaluations to reach a $10^{-3}$
accuracy. We discuss the connection of step-size planing to planning in
reinforcement learning, in particular, Dyna architectures.]]></summary>

performance drastically drops when applied to huge amounts of data. We propose
a new heuristic that is built on the basis of regular K-means for faster and
more accurate big data clustering using the "less is more" and MSSC
decomposition approaches. The main advantage of the proposed algorithm is that
it naturally turns the K-means local search into global one through the process
of decomposition of the MSSC problem. On one hand, decomposition of the MSSC
problem into smaller subproblems reduces the computational complexity and
allows for their parallel processing. On the other hand, the MSSC decomposition
provides a new method for the natural data-driven shaking of the incumbent
solution while introducing a new neighborhood structure for the solution of the
MSSC problem. This leads to a new heuristic that improves K-means in big data
conditions. The scalability of the algorithm to big data can be easily adjusted
by choosing the appropriate number of subproblems and their size. The proposed
algorithm is both scalable and accurate. In our experiments it outperforms all
recent state-of-the-art algorithms for the MSSC in terms of time as well as the

prediction, which predicts sets of labels instead of a single label; in the
classification and regression settings, these algorithms can guarantee that the
true label lies within the prediction set with high probability. Building on
these ideas, we propose multi-object detection and tracking algorithms that
come with probably approximately correct (PAC) guarantees. They do so by
constructing both a prediction set around each object detection as well as
around the set of edge transitions; given an object, the detection prediction
set contains its true bounding box with high probability, and the edge
prediction set contains its true transition across frames with high
probability. We empirically demonstrate that our method can detect and track
objects with PAC guarantees on the COCO and MOT-17 datasets.]]></summary>

optimization algorithms have attracted significant attention for power systems
applications due to their potential for superior scalability, privacy, and
robustness to a single point-of-failure. The Alternating Direction Method of
Multipliers (ADMM) is a popular distributed optimization algorithm; however,
its convergence performance is highly dependent on the selection of penalty
parameters, which are usually chosen heuristically. In this work, we use
reinforcement learning (RL) to develop an adaptive penalty parameter selection
policy for the AC optimal power flow (ACOPF) problem solved via ADMM with the
goal of minimizing the number of iterations until convergence. We train our RL
policy using deep Q-learning, and show that this policy can result in
significantly accelerated convergence (up to a 59% reduction in the number of
iterations compared to existing, curvature-informed penalty parameter selection
methods). Furthermore, we show that our RL policy demonstrates promise for
generalizability, performing well under unseen loading schemes as well as under
unseen losses of lines and generators (up to a 50% reduction in iterations).
This work thus provides a proof-of-concept for using RL for parameter selection
in ADMM for power systems applications.]]></summary>

distributed full-batch training of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) on large

sampling-based methods and methods based on non-learnable message passing. SAR
on the other hand is a distributed technique that can train any GNN type
directly on an entire large graph. The key innovation in SAR is the distributed
sequential rematerialization scheme which sequentially re-constructs then frees
pieces of the prohibitively large GNN computational graph during the backward
pass. This results in excellent memory scaling behavior where the memory
consumption per worker goes down linearly with the number of workers, even for
densely connected graphs. Using SAR, we report the largest applications of
full-batch GNN training to-date, and demonstrate large memory savings as the
number of workers increases. We also present a general technique based on
kernel fusion and attention-matrix rematerialization to optimize both the
runtime and memory efficiency of attention-based models. We show that, coupled

impact on the healthcare domain, and it is being actively studied. Previous
research on structured EHR-QA focuses on converting natural language queries
into query language such as SQL or SPARQL (NLQ2Query), so the problem scope is
limited to pre-defined data types by the specific query language. In order to
expand the EHR-QA task beyond this limitation to handle multi-modal medical
data and solve complex inference in the future, more primitive systemic
language is needed. In this paper, we design the program-based model

tackle MIMICSPARQL*, the graph-based EHR-QA dataset, via a program-based
approach in a semi-supervised manner in order to overcome the absence of gold
programs. Without the gold program, our proposed model shows comparable
performance to the previous state-of-the-art model, which is an NLQ2Query model

a given optimization problem is a challenging task. Accurately predicting how
well a certain algorithm could solve the problem is hence desirable. Recent
studies in single-objective numerical optimization show that supervised machine
learning methods can predict algorithm performance using landscape features
extracted from the problem instances.

Existing approaches typically treat the algorithms as black-boxes, without
consideration of their characteristics. To investigate in this work if a
selection of landscape features that depends on algorithms properties could
further improve regression accuracy, we regard the modular CMA-ES framework and
estimate how much each landscape feature contributes to the best algorithm
performance regression models. Exploratory data analysis performed on this data
indicate that the set of most relevant features does not depend on the
configuration of individual modules, but the influence that these features have
on regression accuracy does. In addition, we have shown that by using
classifiers that take the features relevance on the model accuracy, we are able
to predict the status of individual modules in the CMA-ES configurations.]]></summary>

applicability with automatic forecasting of time series are in high demand.
While no single time series modeling method is universal to all types of

predict these aspects adaptively using meta-learning. Meta-learning here
considers two separate random forest regression models, built on 390
time-series features, to rank 22 univariate forecasting methods and recommend
ensemble size. The forecasting ensemble is consequently formed from methods
ranked as the best, and forecasts are pooled using either simple or weighted
average (with a weight corresponding to reciprocal rank). The proposed approach

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Learning accurate classifiers for novel categories from very few examples,
known as few-shot image classification, is a challenging task in statistical
machine learning and computer vision. The performance in few-shot
classification suffers from the bias in the estimation of classifier
parameters; however, an effective underlying bias reduction technique that
could alleviate this issue in training few-shot classifiers has been
overlooked. In this work, we demonstrate the effectiveness of Firth bias
reduction in few-shot classification. Theoretically, Firth bias reduction
removes the $O(N^{-1})$ first order term from the small-sample bias of the
Maximum Likelihood Estimator. Here we show that the general Firth bias
reduction technique simplifies to encouraging uniform class assignment
probabilities for multinomial logistic classification, and almost has the same
effect in cosine classifiers. We derive an easy-to-implement optimization
objective for Firth penalized multinomial logistic and cosine classifiers,
which is equivalent to penalizing the cross-entropy loss with a KL-divergence
between the uniform label distribution and the predictions. Then, we
empirically evaluate that it is consistently effective across the board for
few-shot image classification, regardless of (1) the feature representations
from different backbones, (2) the number of samples per class, and (3) the
number of classes. Finally, we show the robustness of Firth bias reduction, in
the case of imbalanced data distribution. Our implementation is available at

(AutoML) for well-researched areas, its application to tasks beyond computer
vision is still under-explored. As less-studied domains are precisely those
where we expect AutoML to have the greatest impact, in this work we study NAS
for efficiently solving diverse problems. Seeking an approach that is fast,
simple, and broadly applicable, we fix a standard convolutional network (CNN)
topology and propose to search for the right kernel sizes and dilations its
operations should take on. This dramatically expands the model's capacity to
extract features at multiple resolutions for different types of data while only
requiring search over the operation space. To overcome the efficiency
challenges of naive weight-sharing in this search space, we introduce DASH, a
differentiable NAS algorithm that computes the mixture-of-operations using the
Fourier diagonalization of convolution, achieving both a better asymptotic
complexity and an up-to-10x search time speedup in practice. We evaluate DASH
on NAS-Bench-360, a suite of ten tasks designed for benchmarking NAS in diverse
domains. DASH outperforms state-of-the-art methods in aggregate, attaining the
best-known automated performance on seven tasks. Meanwhile, on six of the ten
tasks, the combined search and retraining time is less than 2x slower than
simply training a CNN backbone that is far less accurate.]]></summary>

Interestingly, we find NLI scores to provide strong retrieval signals, leading
to more relevant evidence extractions compared to common similarity-based

image generation tasks. However, empirical results on previous research in
diffusion models imply that there is an inverse correlation on performances for
density estimation and sample generation. This paper analyzes that the inverse
correlation arises because density estimation is mostly contributed from small
diffusion time, whereas sample generation mainly depends on large diffusion
time. However, training score network on both small and large diffusion time is
demanding because of the loss imbalance issue. To successfully train the score
network on both small and large diffusion time, this paper introduces a
training technique, Soft Truncation, that softens the truncation time for every
mini-batch update, which is universally applicable to any types of diffusion
models. It turns out that Soft Truncation is equivalent to a diffusion model
with a general weight, and we prove the variational bound of the general
weighted diffusion model. In view of this variational bound, Soft Truncation
becomes a natural way to train the score network. In experiments, Soft
Truncation achieves the state-of-the-art performance on CIFAR-10, CelebA,

provides a strategy to train machine learning models while respecting users'
privacy. However, differential privacy can disproportionately degrade the
performance of the models on under-represented groups, as these parts of the
distribution are difficult to learn in the presence of noise. Existing
approaches for enforcing fairness in machine learning models have considered
the centralized setting, in which the algorithm has access to the users' data.
This paper introduces an algorithm to enforce group fairness in private
federated learning, where users' data does not leave their devices. First, the
paper extends the modified method of differential multipliers to empirical risk
minimization with fairness constraints, thus providing an algorithm to enforce
fairness in the central setting. Then, this algorithm is extended to the
private federated learning setting. The proposed algorithm, \texttt{FPFL}, is
tested on a federated version of the Adult dataset and an "unfair" version of
the FEMNIST dataset. The experiments on these datasets show how private
federated learning accentuates unfairness in the trained models, and how FPFL
is able to mitigate such unfairness.]]></summary>

other randomized search heuristics can benefit from a non-static choice of the
parameters that steer their optimization behavior. Mechanisms that identify
suitable configurations on the fly ("parameter control") or via a dedicated
training process ("dynamic algorithm configuration") are therefore an important
component of modern evolutionary computation frameworks. Several approaches to
address the dynamic parameter setting problem exist, but we barely understand
which ones to prefer for which applications. As in classical benchmarking,
problem collections with a known ground truth can offer very meaningful
insights in this context. Unfortunately, settings with well-understood control
policies are very rare.

One of the few exceptions for which we know which parameter settings minimize
the expected runtime is the LeadingOnes problem. We extend this benchmark by
analyzing optimal control policies that can select the parameters only from a
given portfolio of possible values. This also allows us to compute optimal
parameter portfolios of a given size. We demonstrate the usefulness of our
benchmarks by analyzing the behavior of the DDQN reinforcement learning
approach for dynamic algorithm configuration.]]></summary>

primitives that are useful for navigation-heavy embodied tasks -- and find that
CLIP's representations encode these primitives more effectively than

modeling and optimization. We consider the problem of selecting the optimal
process control parameters based on the analysis of historical data from

and give ferroalloys consumption recommendation. The main features of our
method are easy interpretation and noise resistance. Our approach is based on
k-means clustering algorithm, decision trees and linear regression. The main
idea of the method is to identify situations where processes go similarly. For
this, we propose using a k-means based dataset clustering algorithm and a
classification algorithm to determine the cluster. This algorithm can be also
applied to various technological processes, in this article, we demonstrate its
application in metallurgy. To test the application of the proposed method, we
used it to optimize ferroalloys consumption in Basic Oxygen Furnace steelmaking
when finishing steel in a ladle furnace. The minimum required element content
for a given steel grade was selected as the predictive model's target variable,
and the required amount of the element to be added to the melt as the optimized
variable. Keywords: Clustering, Machine Learning, Linear Regression,

more predefined groups or segments, assign users to their corresponding
segments. As an example, for a segment indicating particular interest in a
certain area of sports or entertainment, the task will be to predict whether
each single user will belong to the segment. However, there may exist numerous
long tail prediction tasks that suffer from data availability and may be of
heterogeneous nature, which make it hard to capture using single off the shelf
model architectures. In this work, we present SuperCone, our unified
predicative segments system that addresses the above challenges. It builds on
top of a flat concept representation that summarizes each user's heterogeneous
digital footprints, and uniformly models each of the prediction task using an
approach called "super learning ", that is, combining prediction models with
diverse architectures or learning method that are not compatible with each
other. Following this, we provide an end to end approach that learns to
flexibly attend to best suited heterogeneous experts adaptively, while at the
same time incorporating deep representations of the input concepts that
augments the above experts. Experiments show that SuperCone significantly

While many machine learning methods are not new, university classes on machine
learning are largely unavailable to meteorology students and are not required
to become a meteorologist. The lack of formal instruction has contributed to
perception that machine learning methods are 'black boxes' and thus end-users
are hesitant to apply the machine learning methods in their every day workflow.
To reduce the opaqueness of machine learning methods and lower hesitancy
towards machine learning in meteorology, this paper provides a survey of some
of the most common machine learning methods. A familiar meteorological example
is used to contextualize the machine learning methods while also discussing
machine learning topics using plain language. The following machine learning
methods are demonstrated: linear regression; logistic regression; decision
trees; random forest; gradient boosted decision trees; naive Bayes; and support
vector machines. Beyond discussing the different methods, the paper also
contains discussions on the general machine learning process as well as best
practices to enable readers to apply machine learning to their own datasets.
Furthermore, all code (in the form of Jupyter notebooks and Google Colaboratory
notebooks) used to make the examples in the paper is provided in an effort to
catalyse the use of machine learning in meteorology.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Latent Gaussian models and boosting are widely used techniques in statistics
and machine learning. Tree-boosting shows excellent prediction accuracy on many
data sets, but potential drawbacks are that it assumes conditional independence
of samples, produces discontinuous predictions for, e.g., spatial data, and it
can have difficulty with high-cardinality categorical variables. Latent
Gaussian models, such as Gaussian process and grouped random effects models,
are flexible prior models which explicitly model dependence among samples and
which allow for efficient learning of predictor functions and for making
probabilistic predictions. However, existing latent Gaussian models usually
assume either a zero or a linear prior mean function which can be an
unrealistic assumption. This article introduces a novel approach that combines
boosting and latent Gaussian models to remedy the above-mentioned drawbacks and
to leverage the advantages of both techniques. We obtain increased prediction
accuracy compared to existing approaches in both simulated and real-world data
experiments.]]></summary>

practice by deploying a straightforward algorithm that tries to match the

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Backdoor attacks insert malicious data into a training set so that, during
inference time, it misclassifies inputs that have been patched with a backdoor
trigger as the malware specified label. For backdoor attacks to bypass human
inspection, it is essential that the injected data appear to be correctly
labeled. The attacks with such property are often referred to as "clean-label
attacks." Existing clean-label backdoor attacks require knowledge of the entire
training set to be effective. Obtaining such knowledge is difficult or
impossible because training data are often gathered from multiple sources
(e.g., face images from different users). It remains a question whether
backdoor attacks still present a real threat.

This paper provides an affirmative answer to this question by designing an
algorithm to mount clean-label backdoor attacks based only on the knowledge of
representative examples from the target class. With poisoning equal to or less
than 0.5% of the target-class data and 0.05% of the training set, we can train
a model to classify test examples from arbitrary classes into the target class
when the examples are patched with a backdoor trigger. Our attack works well
across datasets and models, even when the trigger presents in the physical
world.

We explore the space of defenses and find that, surprisingly, our attack can
evade the latest state-of-the-art defenses in their vanilla form, or after a
simple twist, we can adapt to the downstream defenses. We study the cause of
the intriguing effectiveness and find that because the trigger synthesized by
our attack contains features as persistent as the original semantic features of
the target class, any attempt to remove such triggers would inevitably hurt the
model accuracy first.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Lifelong on-device learning is a key challenge for machine intelligence, and
this requires learning from few, often single, samples. Memory augmented neural
network has been proposed to achieve the goal, but the memory module has to be
stored in an off-chip memory due to its size. Therefore the practical use has
been heavily limited. Previous works on emerging memory-based implementation
have difficulties in scaling up because different modules with various
structures are difficult to integrate on the same chip and the small sense
margin of the content addressable memory for the memory module heavily limited
the degree of mismatch calculation. In this work, we implement the entire
memory augmented neural network architecture in a fully integrated memristive
crossbar platform and achieve an accuracy that closely matches standard
software on digital hardware for the Omniglot dataset. The successful
demonstration is supported by implementing new functions in crossbars in
addition to widely reported matrix multiplications. For example, the
locality-sensitive hashing operation is implemented in crossbar arrays by
exploiting the intrinsic stochasticity of memristor devices. Besides, the
content-addressable memory module is realized in crossbars, which also supports
the degree of mismatches. Simulations based on experimentally validated models
show such an implementation can be efficiently scaled up for one-shot learning
on the Mini-ImageNet dataset. The successful demonstration paves the way for
practical on-device lifelong learning and opens possibilities for novel
attention-based algorithms not possible in conventional hardware.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Machine Learning has been applied to pathology images in research and
clinical practice with promising outcomes. However, standard ML models often
lack the rigorous evaluation required for clinical decisions. Machine learning
techniques for natural images are ill-equipped to deal with pathology images
that are significantly large and noisy, require expensive labeling, are hard to
interpret, and are susceptible to spurious correlations. We propose a set of
practical guidelines for ML evaluation in pathology that address the above
concerns. The paper includes measures for setting up the evaluation framework,
effectively dealing with variability in labels, and a recommended suite of
tests to address issues related to domain shift, robustness, and confounding
variables. We hope that the proposed framework will bridge the gap between ML
researchers and domain experts, leading to wider adoption of ML techniques in
pathology and improving patient outcomes.]]></summary>

with generative adversarial neural networks (GANs). Recently, GANs are utilized
as the training sample generator when obtaining or storing real training data
is expensive even infeasible. However, traditional GANs generated images are
not as informative as the real training samples when being used to train deep
neural networks. In this paper, we propose a novel method to synthesize
Informative Training samples with GAN (IT-GAN). Specifically, we freeze a
pre-trained GAN model and learn the informative latent vectors that corresponds
to informative training samples. The synthesized images are required to
preserve information for training deep neural networks rather than visual
reality or fidelity. Experiments verify that the deep neural networks can learn
faster and achieve better performance when being trained with our IT-GAN
generated images. We also show that our method is a promising solution to

deliberate the hypothesis alignment of a streaming RNN-T model. Our algorithm
facilitates a simple greedy decoding procedure, and at the same time is capable
of producing the decoding result at each frame with limited right context, thus
enjoying both high efficiency and low latency. These advantages are achieved by
converting the offline Align-Refine algorithm to be streaming-compatible, with
a novel transformer decoder architecture that performs local self-attentions
for both text and audio, and a time-aligned cross-attention at each layer.
Furthermore, we perform discriminative training of our model with the minimum
word error rate (MWER) criterion, which has not been done in the non-AR
decoding literature. Experiments on voice search datasets and Librispeech show
that with reasonable right context, our streaming model performs as well as the

in biomedical applications. Learning about patients using genetic data often
includes more features than observations, which makes direct supervised
learning difficult. One method of reducing the feature space is to use latent
Dirichlet allocation to group genetic variants in an unsupervised manner.
Latent Dirichlet allocation describes a patient as a mixture of topics
corresponding to genetic variants. This can be generalized as a Bayesian tensor
decomposition to account for multiple feature variables. Our most significant
contributions are with hierarchical topic modeling. We design distinct methods
of incorporating hierarchical topic modeling, based on nested Chinese
restaurant processes and Pachinko Allocation Machine, into Bayesian tensor
decomposition. We apply these models to examine patients with one of four
common types of cancer (breast, lung, prostate, and colorectal) and siblings
with and without autism spectrum disorder. We linked the genes with their
biological pathways and combine this information into a tensor of patients,
counts of their genetic variants, and the genes' membership in pathways. We
find that our trained models outperform baseline models, with respect to
coherence, by up to 40%.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Binary Neural Networks (BNNs) have emerged as a promising solution for
reducing the memory footprint and compute costs of deep neural networks. BNNs,
on the other hand, suffer from information loss because binary activations are
limited to only two values, resulting in reduced accuracy. To improve the
accuracy, previous studies have attempted to control the distribution of binary
activation by manually shifting the threshold of the activation function or
making the shift amount trainable. During the process, they usually depended on
statistical information computed from a batch. We argue that using statistical
data from a batch fails to capture the crucial information for each input
instance in BNN computations, and the differences between statistical
information computed from each instance need to be considered when determining
the binary activation threshold of each instance. Based on the concept, we
propose the Binary Neural Network with INSTAnce-aware threshold (INSTA-BNN),
which decides the activation threshold value considering the difference between
statistical data computed from a batch and each instance. The proposed
INSTA-BNN outperforms the baseline by 2.5% and 2.3% on the ImageNet
classification task with comparable computing cost, achieving 68.0% and 71.7%

to learn a model on labeled training graphs and generalize it to infer node
labels on unlabeled test graphs. This problem has been extensively studied with
graph neural networks (GNNs) by learning effective node representations, as
well as traditional structured prediction methods for modeling the structured
output of node labels, e.g., conditional random fields (CRFs). In this paper,
we present a new approach called the Structured Proxy Network (SPN), which
combines the advantages of both worlds. SPN defines flexible potential
functions of CRFs with GNNs. However, learning such a model is nontrivial as it
involves optimizing a maximin game with high-cost inference. Inspired by the
underlying connection between joint and marginal distributions defined by
Markov networks, we propose to solve an approximate version of the optimization
problem as a proxy, which yields a near-optimal solution, making learning more
efficient. Extensive experiments on two settings show that our approach

Lenia CA, and also report 5 new evolved CA that support evolved glider

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Faster-than-Nyquist (FTN) signaling is a candidate non-orthonormal
transmission technique to improve the spectral efficiency (SE) of future
communication systems. However, such improvements of the SE are at the cost of
additional computational complexity to remove the intentionally introduced
intersymbol interference. In this paper, we investigate the use of deep
learning (DL) to reduce the detection complexity of FTN signaling. To eliminate
the need of having a noise whitening filter at the receiver, we first present
an equivalent FTN signaling model based on using a set of orthonormal basis
functions and identify its operation region. Second, we propose a DL-based list
sphere decoding (DL-LSD) algorithm that selects and updates the initial radius
of the original LSD to guarantee a pre-defined number $N_{\text{L}}$ of lattice
points inside the hypersphere. This is achieved by training a neural network to
output an approximate initial radius that includes $N_{\text{L}}$ lattice
points. At the testing phase, if the hypersphere has more than $N_{\text{L}}$
lattice points, we keep the $N_{\text{L}}$ closest points to the point
corresponding to the received FTN signal; however, if the hypersphere has less
than $N_{\text{L}}$ points, we increase the approximate initial radius by a
value that depends on the standard deviation of the distribution of the output
radii from the training phase. Then, the approximate value of the
log-likelihood ratio (LLR) is calculated based on the obtained $N_{\text{L}}$
points. Simulation results show that the computational complexity of the
proposed DL-LSD is lower than its counterpart of the original LSD by orders of
magnitude.]]></summary>

make use of this uncertainty together with higher-level language information.
For this, we revisit decoding algorithms used in factorial generative models in
early multi-talker speech recognition systems. In contrast with these early

we want to deploy large, powerful models in production and/or edge devices. One
common technique used to achieve this goal is knowledge distillation.
Typically, the output of a static pre-defined teacher (a large base network) is
used as soft labels to train and transfer information to a student (or smaller)
network. In this paper, we introduce Adjoined Networks, or AN, a learning
paradigm that trains both the original base network and the smaller compressed
network together. In our training approach, the parameters of the smaller
network are shared across both the base and the compressed networks. Using our
training paradigm, we can simultaneously compress (the student network) and
regularize (the teacher network) any architecture. In this paper, we focus on
popular CNN-based architectures used for computer vision tasks. We conduct an
extensive experimental evaluation of our training paradigm on various
large-scale datasets. Using ResNet-50 as the base network, AN achieves 71.8%
top-1 accuracy with only 1.8M parameters and 1.6 GFLOPs on the ImageNet
data-set. We further propose Differentiable Adjoined Networks (DAN), a training
paradigm that augments AN by using neural architecture search to jointly learn
both the width and the weights for each layer of the smaller network. DAN
achieves ResNet-50 level accuracy on ImageNet with $3.8\times$ fewer parameters

the hypothesis that MSA is correlated with similarities occurring at the bar
scale, this article introduces the use of linear and non-linear compression
schemes on barwise audio signals. Compressed representations capture the most
salient components of the different bars in the song and are then used to infer
the song structure using a dynamic programming algorithm. This work explores
both low-rank approximation models such as Principal Component Analysis or
Nonnegative Matrix Factorization and "piece-specific" Auto-Encoding Neural
Networks, with the objective to learn latent representations specific to a
given song. Such approaches do not rely on supervision nor annotations, which
are well-known to be tedious to collect and possibly ambiguous in MSA
description. In our experiments, several unsupervised compression schemes
achieve a level of performance comparable to that of state-of-the-art
supervised methods (for 3s tolerance) on the RWC-Pop dataset, showcasing the
importance of the barwise compression processing for MSA.]]></summary>

of real-world scheduling problems. Despite their ability to model general
scheduling problems, solving large-scale integer programs (IP) remains a
computational challenge in practice. The incorporation of more complex
objectives such as robustness to disruptions further exacerbates the
computational challenge. We present NICE (Neural network IP Coefficient
Extraction), a novel technique that combines reinforcement learning and integer
programming to tackle the problem of robust scheduling. More specifically, NICE
uses reinforcement learning to approximately represent complex objectives in an
integer programming formulation. We use NICE to determine assignments of pilots
to a flight crew schedule so as to reduce the impact of disruptions. We compare
NICE with (1) a baseline integer programming formulation that produces a
feasible crew schedule, and (2) a robust integer programming formulation that
explicitly tries to minimize the impact of disruptions. Our experiments show
that, across a variety of scenarios, NICE produces schedules resulting in 33%
to 48% fewer disruptions than the baseline formulation. Moreover, in more
severely constrained scheduling scenarios in which the robust integer program
fails to produce a schedule within 90 minutes, NICE is able to build robust
schedules in less than 2 seconds on average.]]></summary>

generate a diverse collection of agent polices. Training can then be viewed as
a quality diversity (QD) optimization problem, where we search for a collection

Recent work shows that differentiable quality diversity (DQD) algorithms
greatly accelerate QD optimization when exact gradients are available. However,
agent policies typically assume that the environment is not differentiable. To
apply DQD algorithms to training agent policies, we must approximate gradients
for performance and behavior. We propose two variants of the current
state-of-the-art DQD algorithm that compute gradients via approximation methods
common in reinforcement learning (RL). We evaluate our approach on four
simulated locomotion tasks. One variant achieves results comparable to the
current state-of-the-art in combining QD and RL, while the other performs
comparably in two locomotion tasks. These results provide insight into the

Network (GNN) framework, celebrate much success in the analysis of
graph-structured data. Concurrently, the sparsification of Neural Network
models attracts a great amount of academic and industrial interest. In this
paper we conduct a structured, empirical study of the effect of sparsification
on the trainable part of MPNNs known as the Update step. To this end, we design
a series of models to successively sparsify the linear transform in the Update
step. Specifically, we propose the ExpanderGNN model with a tuneable
sparsification rate and the Activation-Only GNN, which has no linear transform
in the Update step. In agreement with a growing trend in the literature the
sparsification paradigm is changed by initialising sparse neural network
architectures rather than expensively sparsifying already trained
architectures. Our novel benchmark models enable a better understanding of the
influence of the Update step on model performance and outperform existing
simplified benchmark models such as the Simple Graph Convolution. The
ExpanderGNNs, and in some cases the Activation-Only models, achieve performance
on par with their vanilla counterparts on several downstream tasks, while
containing significantly fewer trainable parameters. Our code is publicly

growing range of path-based smart-city applications, e.g., travel-time
estimation and travel path ranking. A temporal path(TP) that includes temporal
information, e.g., departure time, into the path is fundamental to enable such
applications. In this setting, it is essential to learn generic temporal path
representations(TPRs) that consider spatial and temporal correlations
simultaneously and that can be used in different applications, i.e., downstream
tasks. Existing methods fail to achieve the goal since (i) supervised methods
require large amounts of task-specific labels when training and thus fail to
generalize the obtained TPRs to other tasks; (ii) through unsupervised methods
can learn generic representations, they disregard the temporal aspect, leading
to sub-optimal results. To contend with the limitations of existing solutions,
we propose a Weakly-Supervised Contrastive (WSC) learning model. We first
propose a temporal path encoder that encodes both the spatial and temporal
information of a temporal path into a TPR. To train the encoder, we introduce
weak labels that are easy and inexpensive to obtain and are relevant to
different tasks, e.g., temporal labels indicating peak vs. off-peak hours from
departure times. Based on the weak labels, we construct meaningful positive and
negative temporal path samples by considering both spatial and temporal
information, which facilities training the encoder using contrastive learning
by pulling closer to the positive samples' representations while pushing away
the negative samples' representations. To better guide contrastive learning, we
propose a learning strategy based on Curriculum Learning such that the learning
performs from easy to hard training instances. Experiments studies verify the
effectiveness of the proposed method.]]></summary>

prevails to deliver high-performance task-specific models and can even learn
general task-agnostic representations for efficient finetuning to downstream
tasks. However, deep learning in resource-limited domains still faces the
following challenges including (i) limited data, (ii) constrained model
development cost, and (iii) lack of adequate pre-trained models for effective

bridge this gap. Model reprogramming enables resource-efficient cross-domain
machine learning by repurposing and reusing a well-developed pre-trained model
from a source domain to solve tasks in a target domain without model
finetuning, where the source and target domains can be vastly different. In
many applications, model reprogramming outperforms transfer learning and
training from scratch. This paper elucidates the methodology of model
reprogramming, summarizes existing use cases, provides a theoretical

Montanari and Richard to study the computational difficulty of estimating an
unknown parameter from higher-order moment tensors. Unlike its matrix
counterpart, Tensor PCA exhibits a statistical-computational gap, i.e., a
sample size regime where the problem is information-theoretically solvable but
conjectured to be computationally hard. This paper derives computational lower
bounds on the run-time of memory bounded algorithms for Tensor PCA using
communication complexity. These lower bounds specify a trade-off among the
number of passes through the data sample, the sample size, and the memory
required by any algorithm that successfully solves Tensor PCA. While the lower
bounds do not rule out polynomial-time algorithms, they do imply that many
commonly-used algorithms, such as gradient descent and power method, must have
a higher iteration count when the sample size is not large enough. Similar
lower bounds are obtained for Non-Gaussian Component Analysis, a family of
statistical estimation problems in which low-order moment tensors carry no
information about the unknown parameter. Finally, stronger lower bounds are
obtained for an asymmetric variant of Tensor PCA and related statistical
estimation problems. These results explain why many estimators for these
problems use a memory state that is significantly larger than the effective
dimensionality of the parameter of interest.]]></summary>

approximation. While deep learning is an extremely powerful way to find
relationships in data, its use in science has been hindered by the difficulty
of understanding the learned relationships. The Information Bottleneck (IB) is
an information theoretic framework for understanding a relationship between an
input and an output in terms of a trade-off between the fidelity and complexity
of approximations to the relationship. Here we show that a crucial modification
-- distributing bottlenecks across multiple components of the input -- opens
fundamentally new avenues for interpretable deep learning in science. The
Distributed Information Bottleneck throttles the downstream complexity of
interactions between the components of the input, deconstructing a relationship
into meaningful approximations found through deep learning without requiring
custom-made datasets or neural network architectures. Applied to a complex
system, the approximations illuminate aspects of the system's nature by
restricting -- and monitoring -- the information about different components
incorporated into the approximation. We demonstrate the Distributed IB's
explanatory utility in systems drawn from applied mathematics and condensed
matter physics. In the former, we deconstruct a Boolean circuit into
approximations that isolate the most informative subsets of input components
without requiring exhaustive search. In the latter, we localize information
about future plastic rearrangement in the static structure of a sheared glass,
and find the information to be more or less diffuse depending on the system's
preparation. By way of a principled scheme of approximations, the Distributed
IB brings much-needed interpretability to deep learning and enables
unprecedented analysis of information flow through a system.]]></summary>

from data supported on moderate-scale graphs. However, they are difficult to
learn on large-scale graphs. In this paper, we study the problem of training
GNNs on graphs of moderate size and transferring them to large-scale graphs. We
use graph limits called graphons to define limit objects for graph filters and
GNNs -- graphon filters and graphon neural networks (WNNs) -- which we
interpret as generative models for graph filters and GNNs. We then show that
graphon filters and WNNs can be approximated by graph filters and GNNs sampled
from them on weighted and stochastic graphs. Because the error of these
approximations can be upper bounded, by a triangle inequality argument we can
further bound the error of transferring a graph filter or a GNN across graphs.
Our results show that (i) the transference error decreases with the graph size,
and (ii) that graph filters have a transferability-discriminability tradeoff
that in GNNs is alleviated by the scattering behavior of the nonlinearity.
These findings are demonstrated empirically in a movie recommendation problem
and in a decentralized control task.]]></summary>

construct flexible high-dimensional densities. This formulation directly
contradicts the manifold hypothesis, which states that observed data lies on a
low-dimensional manifold embedded in high-dimensional ambient space. In this
paper we investigate the pathologies of maximum-likelihood training in the
presence of this dimensionality mismatch. We formally prove that degenerate
optima are achieved wherein the manifold itself is learned but not the
distribution on it, a phenomenon we call manifold overfitting. We propose a
class of two-step procedures consisting of a dimensionality reduction step
followed by maximum-likelihood density estimation, and prove that they recover
the data-generating distribution in the nonparametric regime, thus avoiding
manifold overfitting. We also show that these procedures enable density
estimation on the manifolds learned by implicit models, such as generative
adversarial networks, hence addressing a major shortcoming of these models.
Several recently proposed methods are instances of our two-step procedures; we
thus unify, extend, and theoretically justify a large class of models.]]></summary>

we want to deploy large, powerful models in production and/or edge devices. One
common technique used to achieve this goal is knowledge distillation.
Typically, the output of a static pre-defined teacher (a large base network) is
used as soft labels to train and transfer information to a student (or smaller)
network. In this paper, we introduce Adjoined Networks, or AN, a learning
paradigm that trains both the original base network and the smaller compressed
network together. In our training approach, the parameters of the smaller
network are shared across both the base and the compressed networks. Using our
training paradigm, we can simultaneously compress (the student network) and
regularize (the teacher network) any architecture. In this paper, we focus on
popular CNN-based architectures used for computer vision tasks. We conduct an
extensive experimental evaluation of our training paradigm on various
large-scale datasets. Using ResNet-50 as the base network, AN achieves 71.8%
top-1 accuracy with only 1.8M parameters and 1.6 GFLOPs on the ImageNet
data-set. We further propose Differentiable Adjoined Networks (DAN), a training
paradigm that augments AN by using neural architecture search to jointly learn
both the width and the weights for each layer of the smaller network. DAN
achieves ResNet-50 level accuracy on ImageNet with $3.8\times$ fewer parameters

inter/intra-subject variability of electroencephalography (EEG). The BCI
system, in general, necessitates a calibration technique to obtain
subject/session-specific data in order to tune the model each time the system
is utilized. This issue is acknowledged as a key hindrance to BCI, and a new
strategy based on domain generalization has recently evolved to address it. In
light of this, we've concentrated on developing an EEG classification framework
that can be applied directly to data from unknown domains (i.e. subjects),
using only data acquired from separate subjects previously. For this purpose,
in this paper, we proposed a framework that employs the open-set recognition
technique as an auxiliary task to learn subject-specific style features from
the source dataset while helping the shared feature extractor with mapping the
features of the unseen target dataset as a new unseen domain. Our aim is to
impose cross-instance style in-variance in the same domain and reduce the open
space risk on the potential unseen subject in order to improve the
generalization ability of the shared feature extractor. Our experiments showed
that using the domain information as an auxiliary network increases the
generalization performance.]]></summary>

training the pruning scores of all layers simultaneously our method can account
for layer interdependencies, which is essential to find a performant sparse
sub-network. Our proposed method can train and generate a pruned network from

appropriate number of channels in each layer. Our experimental results on
different network architectures suggest that SbF-Pruner outperforms advanced
pruning methods. Notably, on CIFAR-10, without requiring a pretrained baseline
network, we obtain 1.02% and 1.19% accuracy gain on ResNet56 and ResNet110,

item representations. In practice, these representations are highly entangled
as they consist of information about multiple factors, including user's
interests, item attributes along with confounding factors such as user
conformity, and item popularity. Considering these entangled representations
for inferring user preference may lead to biased recommendations (e.g., when
the recommender model recommends popular items even if they do not align with
the user's interests).

Recent research proposes to debias by modeling a recommender system from a
causal perspective. The exposure and the ratings are analogous to the treatment
and the outcome in the causal inference framework, respectively. The critical
challenge in this setting is accounting for the hidden confounders. These
confounders are unobserved, making it hard to measure them. On the other hand,
since these confounders affect both the exposure and the ratings, it is
essential to account for them in generating debiased recommendations. To better
approximate hidden confounders, we propose to leverage network information
(i.e., user-social and user-item networks), which are shown to influence how
users discover and interact with an item. Aside from the user conformity,
aspects of confounding such as item popularity present in the network
information is also captured in our method with the aid of \textit{causal
disentanglement} which unravels the learned representations into independent
factors that are responsible for (a) modeling the exposure of an item to the
user, (b) predicting the ratings, and (c) controlling the hidden confounders.
Experiments on real-world datasets validate the effectiveness of the proposed
model for debiasing recommender systems.]]></summary>

Montanari and Richard to study the computational difficulty of estimating an
unknown parameter from higher-order moment tensors. Unlike its matrix
counterpart, Tensor PCA exhibits a statistical-computational gap, i.e., a
sample size regime where the problem is information-theoretically solvable but
conjectured to be computationally hard. This paper derives computational lower
bounds on the run-time of memory bounded algorithms for Tensor PCA using
communication complexity. These lower bounds specify a trade-off among the
number of passes through the data sample, the sample size, and the memory
required by any algorithm that successfully solves Tensor PCA. While the lower
bounds do not rule out polynomial-time algorithms, they do imply that many
commonly-used algorithms, such as gradient descent and power method, must have
a higher iteration count when the sample size is not large enough. Similar
lower bounds are obtained for Non-Gaussian Component Analysis, a family of
statistical estimation problems in which low-order moment tensors carry no
information about the unknown parameter. Finally, stronger lower bounds are
obtained for an asymmetric variant of Tensor PCA and related statistical
estimation problems. These results explain why many estimators for these
problems use a memory state that is significantly larger than the effective
dimensionality of the parameter of interest.]]></summary>

access to the ground-truth activity labels in the inference phase. If these
labels are not available, the anomaly score is calculated through outlier
detection on the embedding vectors obtained by the activity-detection model.
Solving this auxiliary task enables the model to learn the difference between
the target machine sounds and similar background noise, which makes it possible
to identify small deviations in the target sounds. Experimental results showed
that the proposed method improves the anomaly-detection performance of the
conventional method complementarily by means of an ensemble.]]></summary>

task.Deep learning is used to learn the mapping between image content and crowd
density distribution. Although great success has been achieved, some
pedestrians far away from the camera are difficult to be detected. And the
number of hard examples is often larger. Existing methods with simple Euclidean
distance algorithm indiscriminately optimize the hard and easy examples so that
the densities of hard examples are usually incorrectly predicted to be lower or
even zero, which results in large counting errors. To address this problem, we
are the first to propose the Hard Example Focusing(HEF) algorithm for the
regression task of crowd counting. The HEF algorithm makes our model rapidly
focus on hard examples by attenuating the contribution of easy examples.Then
higher importance will be given to the hard examples with wrong estimations.
Moreover, the scale variations in crowd scenes are large, and the scale
annotations are labor-intensive and expensive. By proposing a multi-Scale
Semantic Refining (SSR) strategy, lower layers of our model can break through
the limitation of deep learning to capture semantic features of different
scales to sufficiently deal with the scale variation. We perform extensive
experiments on six benchmark datasets to verify the proposed method. Results
indicate the superiority of our proposed method over the state-of-the-art
methods. Moreover, our designed model is smaller and faster.]]></summary>

relations into dense continuous vector spaces such that knowledge contained in
a dataset could be consistently represented. Dense embeddings trained from KG
datasets benefit a variety of downstream tasks such as KG completion and link

systematic solution for the global consistency of knowledge representation. We
developed a mathematical language for KG based on an observation of their
inherent algebraic structure, which we termed as Knowledgebra. By analyzing
five distinct algebraic properties, we proved that the semigroup is the most
reasonable algebraic structure for the relation embedding of a general
knowledge graph. We implemented an instantiation model, SemE, using simple
matrix semigroups, which exhibits state-of-the-art performance on standard
datasets. Moreover, we proposed a regularization-based method to integrate
chain-like logic rules derived from human knowledge into embedding training,
which further demonstrates the power of the developed language. As far as we
know, by applying abstract algebra in statistical learning, this work develops
the first formal language for general knowledge graphs, and also sheds light on
the problem of neural-symbolic integration from an algebraic perspective.]]></summary>

controlling the wearable robots while walking in complex environments. However,
human-robot interface signals are usually user-dependent, which causes that the
classifier trained on source subjects performs poorly on new subjects. To
address this issue, this paper designs the ensemble diverse hypotheses and
knowledge distillation (EDHKD) method to realize unsupervised cross-subject
adaptation. EDH mitigates the divergence between labeled data of source
subjects and unlabeled data of target subjects to accurately classify the
locomotion modes of target subjects without labeling data. Compared to previous
domain adaptation methods based on the single learner, which may only learn a
subset of features from input signals, EDH can learn diverse features by
incorporating multiple diverse feature generators and thus increases the
accuracy and decreases the variance of classifying target data, but it
sacrifices the efficiency. To solve this problem, EDHKD (student) distills the
knowledge from the EDH (teacher) to a single network to remain efficient and
accurate. The performance of the EDHKD is theoretically proved and
experimentally validated on a 2D moon dataset and two public human locomotion
datasets. Experimental results show that the EDHKD outperforms all other
methods. The EDHKD can classify target data with 96.9%, 94.4%, and 97.4%
average accuracy on the above three datasets with a short computing time (1
ms). Compared to a benchmark (BM) method, the EDHKD increases 1.3% and 7.1%
average accuracy for classifying the locomotion modes of target subjects. The
EDHKD also stabilizes the learning curves. Therefore, the EDHKD is significant
for increasing the generalization ability and efficiency of the human intent
prediction and human activity recognition system, which will improve
human-robot interactions.]]></summary>

require millions of training samples to converge to an adequate policy. One way
to combat this issue is to use action advising in a teacher-student framework,
where a knowledgeable teacher provides action advice to help the student. This
work considers how to better leverage uncertainties about when a student should
ask for advice and if the student can model the teacher to ask for less advice.
The student could decide to ask for advice when it is uncertain or when both it
and its model of the teacher are uncertain. In addition to this investigation,
this paper introduces a new method to compute uncertainty for a deep RL agent

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Graph neural networks have emerged as a leading architecture for many
graph-level tasks such as graph classification and graph generation with a
notable improvement. Among these tasks, graph pooling is an essential component
of graph neural network architectures for obtaining a holistic graph-level
representation of the entire graph. Although a great variety of methods have
been proposed in this promising and fast-developing research field, to the best
of our knowledge, little effort has been made to systematically summarize these
methods. To set the stage for the development of future works, in this paper,
we attempt to fill this gap by providing a broad review of recent methods on
graph pooling. Specifically, 1) we first propose a taxonomy of existing graph
pooling methods and provide a mathematical summary for each category; 2) next,
we provide an overview of the libraries related to graph pooling, including the
commonly used datasets, model architectures for downstream tasks, and
open-source implementations; 3) then, we further outline in brief the
applications that incorporate the idea of graph pooling in a number of domains;
4) and finally, we discuss some critical challenges faced by the current
studies and share our insights on potential directions for improving graph
pooling in the future.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Adversarial training (i.e., training on adversarially perturbed input data)
is a well-studied method for making neural networks robust to potential
adversarial attacks during inference. However, the improved robustness does not
come for free but rather is accompanied by a decrease in overall model accuracy
and performance. Recent work has shown that, in practical robot learning
applications, the effects of adversarial training do not pose a fair trade-off
but inflict a net loss when measured in holistic robot performance. This work
revisits the robustness-accuracy trade-off in robot learning by systematically
analyzing if recent advances in robust training methods and theory in
conjunction with adversarial robot learning can make adversarial training
suitable for real-world robot applications. We evaluate a wide variety of robot
learning tasks ranging from autonomous driving in a high-fidelity environment
amenable to sim-to-real deployment, to mobile robot gesture recognition. Our
results demonstrate that, while these techniques make incremental improvements
on the trade-off on a relative scale, the negative side-effects caused by
adversarial training still outweigh the improvements by an order of magnitude.
We conclude that more substantial advances in robust learning methods are
necessary before they can benefit robot learning tasks in practice.]]></summary>

vision that has motivated extensive research into numerous methods spanning
from sophisticated meta-learning methods to simple transfer learning baselines.
We seek to push the limits of a simple-but-effective pipeline for more
realistic and practical settings of few-shot image classification. To this end,
we explore few-shot learning from the perspective of neural network
architecture, as well as a three stage pipeline of network updates under
different data supplies, where unsupervised external data is considered for
pre-training, base categories are used to simulate few-shot tasks for
meta-training, and the scarcely labelled data of an novel task is taken for
fine-tuning. We investigate questions such as: (1) How pre-training on external
data benefits FSL? (2) How state-of-the-art transformer architectures can be
exploited? and (3) How fine-tuning mitigates domain shift? Ultimately, we show
that a simple transformer-based pipeline yields surprisingly good performance
on standard benchmarks such as Mini-ImageNet, CIFAR-FS, CDFSL and Meta-Dataset.

image generation tasks. However, empirical results on previous research in
diffusion models imply that there is an inverse correlation on performances for
density estimation and sample generation. This paper analyzes that the inverse
correlation arises because density estimation is mostly contributed from small
diffusion time, whereas sample generation mainly depends on large diffusion
time. However, training score network on both small and large diffusion time is
demanding because of the loss imbalance issue. To successfully train the score
network on both small and large diffusion time, this paper introduces a
training technique, Soft Truncation, that softens the truncation time for every
mini-batch update, which is universally applicable to any types of diffusion
models. It turns out that Soft Truncation is equivalent to a diffusion model
with a general weight, and we prove the variational bound of the general
weighted diffusion model. In view of this variational bound, Soft Truncation
becomes a natural way to train the score network. In experiments, Soft
Truncation achieves the state-of-the-art performance on CIFAR-10, CelebA,
CelebA-HQ $256\times 256$, and STL-10 datasets.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Latent Gaussian models and boosting are widely used techniques in statistics
and machine learning. Tree-boosting shows excellent prediction accuracy on many
data sets, but potential drawbacks are that it assumes conditional independence
of samples, produces discontinuous predictions for, e.g., spatial data, and it
can have difficulty with high-cardinality categorical variables. Latent
Gaussian models, such as Gaussian process and grouped random effects models,
are flexible prior models which explicitly model dependence among samples and
which allow for efficient learning of predictor functions and for making
probabilistic predictions. However, existing latent Gaussian models usually
assume either a zero or a linear prior mean function which can be an
unrealistic assumption. This article introduces a novel approach that combines
boosting and latent Gaussian models to remedy the above-mentioned drawbacks and
to leverage the advantages of both techniques. We obtain increased prediction
accuracy compared to existing approaches in both simulated and real-world data
experiments.]]></summary>

applicability with automatic forecasting of time series are in high demand.
While no single time series modeling method is universal to all types of

predict these aspects adaptively using meta-learning. Meta-learning here
considers two separate random forest regression models, built on 390
time-series features, to rank 22 univariate forecasting methods and recommend
ensemble size. The forecasting ensemble is consequently formed from methods
ranked as the best, and forecasts are pooled using either simple or weighted
average (with a weight corresponding to reciprocal rank). The proposed approach
was tested on 12561 micro-economic time-series (expanded to 38633 for various
forecasting horizons) of M4 competition where meta-learning outperformed Theta

Dirichlet allocation to group genetic variants in an unsupervised manner.
Latent Dirichlet allocation describes a patient as a mixture of topics
corresponding to genetic variants. This can be generalized as a Bayesian tensor
decomposition to account for multiple feature variables. Our most significant
contributions are with hierarchical topic modeling. We design distinct methods
of incorporating hierarchical topic modeling, based on nested Chinese
restaurant processes and Pachinko Allocation Machine, into Bayesian tensor
decomposition. We apply these models to examine patients with one of four
common types of cancer (breast, lung, prostate, and colorectal) and siblings
with and without autism spectrum disorder. We linked the genes with their
biological pathways and combine this information into a tensor of patients,
counts of their genetic variants, and the genes' membership in pathways. We
find that our trained models outperform baseline models, with respect to
coherence, by up to 40%.]]></summary>

provides a strategy to train machine learning models while respecting users'
privacy. However, differential privacy can disproportionately degrade the
performance of the models on under-represented groups, as these parts of the
distribution are difficult to learn in the presence of noise. Existing
approaches for enforcing fairness in machine learning models have considered
the centralized setting, in which the algorithm has access to the users' data.
This paper introduces an algorithm to enforce group fairness in private
federated learning, where users' data does not leave their devices. First, the
paper extends the modified method of differential multipliers to empirical risk
minimization with fairness constraints, thus providing an algorithm to enforce
fairness in the central setting. Then, this algorithm is extended to the
private federated learning setting. The proposed algorithm, \texttt{FPFL}, is
tested on a federated version of the Adult dataset and an "unfair" version of
the FEMNIST dataset. The experiments on these datasets show how private
federated learning accentuates unfairness in the trained models, and how FPFL
is able to mitigate such unfairness.]]></summary>

due to their versatile structure, simple recursive updating, ability to handle
missing data, and probabilistic forecasting. However, the options for count
time series are limited: Gaussian DLMs require continuous data, while
Poisson-based alternatives often lack sufficient modeling flexibility. We
introduce a novel semiparametric methodology for count time series by warping a
Gaussian DLM. The warping function has two components: a (nonparametric)
transformation operator that provides distributional flexibility and a rounding
operator that ensures the correct support for the discrete data-generating
process. We develop conjugate inference for the warped DLM, which enables
analytic and recursive updates for the state space filtering and smoothing
distributions. We leverage these results to produce customized and efficient
algorithms for inference and forecasting, including Monte Carlo simulation for
offline analysis and an optimal particle filter for online inference. This
framework unifies and extends a variety of discrete time series models and is
valid for natural counts, rounded values, and multivariate observations.
Simulation studies illustrate the excellent forecasting capabilities of the
warped DLM. The proposed approach is applied to a multivariate time series of
daily overdose counts and demonstrates both modeling and computational
successes.]]></summary>

comprising of long texts, there has been a rise in NLP benchmarks that measure
the accuracy of models that can handle longer input sequences. However, these
benchmarks do not consider the trade-offs between accuracy, speed, and power
consumption as input sizes or model sizes are varied. In this work, we perform
a systematic study of this accuracy vs. efficiency trade-off on two widely used
long-sequence models - Longformer-Encoder-Decoder (LED) and Big Bird - during
fine-tuning and inference on four datasets from the SCROLLS benchmark. To study
how this trade-off differs across hyperparameter settings, we compare the
models across four sequence lengths (1024, 2048, 3072, 4096) and two model
sizes (base and large) under a fixed resource budget. We find that LED
consistently achieves better accuracy at lower energy costs than Big Bird. For
summarization, we find that increasing model size is more energy efficient than
increasing sequence length for higher accuracy. However, this comes at the cost
of a large drop in inference speed. For question answering, we find that
smaller models are both more efficient and more accurate due to the larger
training batch sizes possible under a fixed resource budget.]]></summary>

research subject in many different fields. Brain signal processing and

In this paper, we present a novel framework allowing us to retrieve the

signals. While previous methods often consider the spatial relationship in EEG
through electrodes and process them in recurrent or convolutional based
architecture, we propose here to also exploit the spatial and temporal
information with a transformer-based network that has already shown its
supremacy in many machine-learning (ML) related studies, e.g. machine
translation. In addition to this novel architecture, an extensive study on the
feature extraction methods, frequential bands and temporal windows length has
also been carried out. The proposed network has been trained and validated on

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There are many important high dimensional function classes that have fast
agnostic learning algorithms when strong assumptions on the distribution of
examples can be made, such as Gaussianity or uniformity over the domain. But
how can one be sufficiently confident that the data indeed satisfies the
distributional assumption, so that one can trust in the output quality of the
agnostic learning algorithm? We propose a model by which to systematically
study the design of tester-learner pairs $(\mathcal{A},\mathcal{T})$, such that
if the distribution on examples in the data passes the tester $\mathcal{T}$
then one can safely trust the output of the agnostic learner $\mathcal{A}$ on
the data.

To demonstrate the power of the model, we apply it to the classical problem
of agnostically learning halfspaces under the standard Gaussian distribution
and present a tester-learner pair with a combined run-time of
$n^{\tilde{O}(1/\epsilon^4)}$. This qualitatively matches that of the best
known ordinary agnostic learning algorithms for this task. In contrast, finite
sample Gaussian distribution testers do not exist for the $L_1$ and EMD
distance measures. A key step in the analysis is a novel characterization of
concentration and anti-concentration properties of a distribution whose
low-degree moments approximately match those of a Gaussian. We also use tools
from polynomial approximation theory.

In contrast, we show strong lower bounds on the combined run-times of
tester-learner pairs for the problems of agnostically learning convex sets
under the Gaussian distribution and for monotone Boolean functions under the
uniform distribution over $\{0,1\}^n$. Through these lower bounds we exhibit
natural problems where there is a dramatic gap between standard agnostic
learning run-time and the run-time of the best tester-learner pair.]]></summary>

item representations. In practice, these representations are highly entangled
as they consist of information about multiple factors, including user's
interests, item attributes along with confounding factors such as user
conformity, and item popularity. Considering these entangled representations
for inferring user preference may lead to biased recommendations (e.g., when
the recommender model recommends popular items even if they do not align with
the user's interests).

Recent research proposes to debias by modeling a recommender system from a
causal perspective. The exposure and the ratings are analogous to the treatment
and the outcome in the causal inference framework, respectively. The critical
challenge in this setting is accounting for the hidden confounders. These
confounders are unobserved, making it hard to measure them. On the other hand,
since these confounders affect both the exposure and the ratings, it is
essential to account for them in generating debiased recommendations. To better
approximate hidden confounders, we propose to leverage network information
(i.e., user-social and user-item networks), which are shown to influence how
users discover and interact with an item. Aside from the user conformity,
aspects of confounding such as item popularity present in the network
information is also captured in our method with the aid of \textit{causal
disentanglement} which unravels the learned representations into independent
factors that are responsible for (a) modeling the exposure of an item to the
user, (b) predicting the ratings, and (c) controlling the hidden confounders.
Experiments on real-world datasets validate the effectiveness of the proposed
model for debiasing recommender systems.]]></summary>

successful false-acceptance adversarial attacks on signature verification
systems. Initially, a convolutional neural network topology and data
augmentation strategy are explored and tuned, producing an 87.12% accurate
model for the verification of 2,640 human signatures. Two robots are then
tasked with forging 50 signatures, where 25 are used for the verification
attack, and the remaining 25 are used for tuning of the model to defend against
them. Adversarial attacks on the system show that there exists an information
security risk; the Line-us robotic arm can fool the system 24% of the time and
the iDraw 2.0 robot 32% of the time. A conditional GAN finds similar success,
with around 30% forged signatures misclassified as genuine. Following fine-tune
transfer learning of robotic and generative data, adversarial attacks are
reduced below the model threshold by both robots and the GAN. It is observed
that tuning the model reduces the risk of attack by robots to 8% and 12%, and
that conditional generative adversarial attacks can be reduced to 4% when 25
images are presented and 5% when 1000 images are presented.]]></summary>

evolution dynamics of materials, e.g., in spinodal decomposition of a two-phase
mixture. However, the accuracy of high-fidelity phase field models comes at a
substantial computational cost. Hence, fast and generalizable surrogate models
are needed to alleviate the cost in computationally taxing processes such as in
optimization and design of materials. The intrinsic discontinuous nature of the
physical phenomena incurred by the presence of sharp phase boundaries makes the
training of the surrogate model cumbersome. We develop a new framework that
integrates a convolutional autoencoder architecture with a deep neural operator
(DeepONet) to learn the dynamic evolution of a two-phase mixture. We utilize
the convolutional autoencoder to provide a compact representation of the
microstructure data in a low-dimensional latent space. DeepONet, which consists
of two sub-networks, one for encoding the input function at a fixed number of
sensors locations (branch net) and another for encoding the locations for the
output functions (trunk net), learns the mesoscale dynamics of the
microstructure evolution in the latent space. The decoder part of the
convolutional autoencoder can then reconstruct the time-evolved microstructure
from the DeepONet predictions. The result is an efficient and accurate
accelerated phase-field framework that outperforms other neural-network-based
approaches while at the same time being robust to noisy inputs.]]></summary>

hierarchical representations using gradient-based learning. However, current
biologically plausible methods for gradient-based credit assignment in deep
neural networks need infinitesimally small feedback signals, which is
problematic in biologically realistic noisy environments and at odds with
experimental evidence in neuroscience showing that top-down feedback can
significantly influence neural activity. Building upon deep feedback control
(DFC), a recently proposed credit assignment method, we combine strong feedback
influences on neural activity with gradient-based learning and show that this
naturally leads to a novel view on neural network optimization. Instead of
gradually changing the network weights towards configurations with low output
loss, weight updates gradually minimize the amount of feedback required from a
controller that drives the network to the supervised output label. Moreover, we
show that the use of strong feedback in DFC allows learning forward and
feedback connections simultaneously, using a learning rule fully local in space
and time. We complement our theoretical results with experiments on standard
computer-vision benchmarks, showing competitive performance to backpropagation
as well as robustness to noise. Overall, our work presents a fundamentally
novel view of learning as control minimization, while sidestepping biologically
unrealistic assumptions.]]></summary>

with the translation equivariance of convolutional neural networks being a
canonical example. Equivariances can be embedded in architectures through
weight-sharing and place symmetry constraints on the functions a neural network
can represent. The type of symmetry is typically fixed and has to be chosen in
advance. Although some tasks are inherently equivariant, many tasks do not
strictly follow such symmetries. In such cases, equivariance constraints can be
overly restrictive. In this work, we propose a parameter-efficient relaxation
of equivariance that can effectively interpolate between a (i) non-equivariant
linear product, (ii) a strict-equivariant convolution, and (iii) a
strictly-invariant mapping. The proposed parameterization can be thought of as
a building block to allow adjustable symmetry structure in neural networks.
Compared to non-equivariant or strict-equivariant baselines, we experimentally
verify that soft equivariance leads to improved performance in terms of test
accuracy on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 image classification tasks.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[CP decomposition (CPD) is prevalent in chemometrics, signal processing, data
mining and many more fields. While many algorithms have been proposed to
compute the CPD, alternating least squares (ALS) remains one of the most widely
used algorithm for computing the decomposition. Recent works have introduced
the notion of eigenvalues and singular values of a tensor and explored
applications of eigenvectors and singular vectors in areas like signal
processing, data analytics and in various other fields. We introduce a new
formulation for deriving singular values and vectors of a tensor by considering
the critical points of a function different from what is used in the previous
work. Computing these critical points in an alternating manner motivates an
alternating optimization algorithm which corresponds to alternating least
squares algorithm in the matrix case. However, for tensors with order greater
than equal to $3$, it minimizes an objective function which is different from
the commonly used least squares loss. Alternating optimization of this new
objective leads to simple updates to the factor matrices with the same
asymptotic computational cost as ALS. We show that a subsweep of this algorithm
can achieve a superlinear convergence rate for exact CPD with known rank and
verify it experimentally. We then view the algorithm as optimizing a
Mahalanobis distance with respect to each factor with ground metric dependent
on the other factors. This perspective allows us to generalize our approach to
interpolate between updates corresponding to the ALS and the new algorithm to
manage the tradeoff between stability and fitness of the decomposition. Our
experimental results show that for approximating synthetic and real-world
tensors, this algorithm and its variants converge to a better conditioned
decomposition with comparable and sometimes better fitness as compared to the
ALS algorithm.]]></summary>

function of their microscopic structures, i.e., morphological configurations of
crystals and pores. This microstructural dependency has motivated vigorous
research in the EM community, seeking to engineer material microstructures with
targeted properties and performance under the materials-by-design paradigm.
However, establishing the complex structure-property-performance (SPP)
relationships of EMs demands extensive experimental and simulation efforts, and
assimilating and encapsulating these relationships in usable models is a
challenge. Here, we present a novel deep learning method, Physics-Aware
Recurrent Convolutional (PARC) Neural Network, that can "learn" the mesoscale
thermo-mechanics of EM microstructures during the shock-to-detonation
transition (SDT). We show that this new approach can produce accurate
high-fidelity predictions of time-evolving temperature and pressure fields of
the same quality as the state-of-the-art direct numerical simulations (DNS),
despite the dramatic reduction of computing time, from hours and days on a
high-performance computing cluster (HPC) to a little more than a second on a
commodity laptop. We also demonstrate that PARC can provide physical insights,
i.e., the artificial neurons can illuminate the underlying physics by
identifying which microstructural features led to critical hotspots and what
are the characteristics of "critical" versus "non-critical" microstructures.
This new knowledge generated alongside the capacity to conduct high-throughput
experiments will broaden our theoretical understanding of the initiation
mechanisms of EM detonation, as a step towards engineering EMs with specific
properties.]]></summary>

construct flexible high-dimensional densities. This formulation directly
contradicts the manifold hypothesis, which states that observed data lies on a
low-dimensional manifold embedded in high-dimensional ambient space. In this
paper we investigate the pathologies of maximum-likelihood training in the
presence of this dimensionality mismatch. We formally prove that degenerate
optima are achieved wherein the manifold itself is learned but not the
distribution on it, a phenomenon we call manifold overfitting. We propose a
class of two-step procedures consisting of a dimensionality reduction step
followed by maximum-likelihood density estimation, and prove that they recover
the data-generating distribution in the nonparametric regime, thus avoiding
manifold overfitting. We also show that these procedures enable density
estimation on the manifolds learned by implicit models, such as generative
adversarial networks, hence addressing a major shortcoming of these models.
Several recently proposed methods are instances of our two-step procedures; we
thus unify, extend, and theoretically justify a large class of models.]]></summary>

 Code & more info: https://github.com/athairus/SpoonfyDemo
 Discord: https://discord.gg/7wcZZzeSQk 
 Spoonfy is essentially the so-called Telenovela method (learning languages through subtitled video) on steroids: This demo uses a finetuned Facebook's M2M100 model to translate Spanish to English (finetuned to do literal translation instead of ordinary translation) and a wav2vec2 model to get Spanish word timings to present the literal (aka word-by-word) translations as karaoke-style lyrics.
 What sets Spoonfy apart from other solutions is the way it leverages the massive body of existing subtitled content out there to create learning material. Also because it's FOSS. More details in the code's README.
 I've been working on this project by myself for a few months now, I hope you see potential behind it like I do! If so (but also if not), I'd love to hear what you think. And I'd love to get your help improving on what I already built. I have plenty of ideas for how to make the translations even more accurate, the system more robust & able to handle more sources of content (YouTube, TikTok, Blu-Rays), etc. 
 Thanks for checking it out!

What is your favorite methods for knowledge representation, is it Formal logic or graphs or whatever and why you like that kind of representation. Considering the success of large language model isn't it a good time to use them in new kind of representation, so that robots or similar system can make better decisions in an environment.

 I am doing a project where I have to predict sales for a company and I am having some trouble with my LSTM model in python. All research I have done tells me that LSTM is as good, if not better, than a ARIMA model for forecasting on time series data, but my LSTM is significantly worse than my ARIMA model. Would it be possible for any one to help me to see if I have implemented it right? I have used both Tensorflow and Pytorch and both are way worse than the ARIMA model.

The filtered dataset with anonymized personally identifiable information (e.g. license plates and phone numbers), masks, initial camera poses, and optimized NeRS cameras will be made available on the project page.
  
However, if you check their project page or github repo — there is nothing there. I do not have much experience in machine learning, but wonder whether it's ok to do this? My thinking was that it is something to look down upon, but in this case it is done by Carnegie Mellon University (which is a top-tier one in ML?) on a top-tier conference (NeurIPS 2021). So I assume it's fine?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, everyone. I'm a relative novice in RL, so bear with me as I try to formulate my question.
 I'm working on a chess bot that can play moves like a player (imitate their style of play) that is chosen from a set of players (that the bot is trained on) , if I give the bot the previous x moves. Using more technical terms, I'm trying to create an agent that is given a sequence of states-actions of another agent (player) and some representation of who that agent (player) is, and predict the next action (continue playing in the style of that player).
 I'm fairly certain this is an RL problem, as I don't know how to frame it as a supervised learning problem (I might be wrong).
 I've seen some papers that abstract offline RL as a sequence modeling problem (Decision Transformer, Trajectory Transformer), so I'm fairly certain I should continue in a similar manner.
 But I'm having a hard time trying to understand how to treat the difference in players. My instinct was to use some representation of the player as the reward, but then how would I even optimize for it or even give it as an input? Do I just add the player as a feature in the game state, but then what should be the reward?
 Has this been done before, or something similar? I couldn't really find any paper or code that worked on differentiating the training data by who made it (I might not be wording it correctly).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, I heard there are different ways to calculate Wasserstein distance in Neural network context. First, We can convert 1-d Wasserstein loss to dual representation and constraint it's size(to makes lipschitz function). We need to do weight clip to make our model a lipschitz function. Second, we can make neural network output as Gaussian distribution and calculate easy form using neural network output as mean and covariance matrix.
 So, what are the advantages and disadvantages of comparing them? It may sound ambiguous, but I have not seen a study that compares the two about representation quality, computation, etc...

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi All!
 I've been working on a linear method that extracts signals from images by learning a set of composable image filters. It can recompose an image using these filters as seen on this biological histology tissue (real on the right, recomposed on the left)
 ​
 ​
 https://preview.redd.it/czgdk6edx0u81.png?width=768&format=png&auto=webp&s=8768f93a749fff7dc41e576a74403096e113942e
 ​
 Because it is a linear method that learns image filters - I had an idea: what if some components of a neural network could be replaced with a learnable set of filters?
 For those not in the know, image filters are similar to masks that upweight some parts of the image, and downweights other parts - similar to a highlighter to select text and a pen to cross out words. I show how in the figure below:
 ​
 ​
 https://preview.redd.it/2azco14ex0u81.jpg?width=499&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f3795fec06daa13da61ec155159a0ad865524530
 ​
 Learning a set of image filters with a neural network is a good idea, as neural networks are much more flexible and are considered to be "universal function approximations". So I wrote up a Pytorch package to pass the neural network feature weights from Convolutions and Max Pooling into the linear method to learn a relevant set of filters - results are comparable even on CIFAR10.
 The caveat is that there is no ReLU, no other activation functions, and no Dropout - only 1 main single linear layer that learns filters... an interpretable neural network!
 ​
 Results are all here (including ipynb comparing with base CNN and VGG16)
 https://github.com/AskExplain/Interpretable-Neural-Net
 ​
 I'll update the GitHub with some figures of why the single layer is interpretable soon ...
 ​
 In the meantime - discuss!

 In ML we often see ablative studies. How is the opposite of it called? In other words: A study that aim to improve a model, and once an improvement is reached, this new model is taken as basis for further investigations?

 - If you request to reassign a reviewer, would the editor aim for reassigning all three reviewers or he would go for reassigning only that particular reviewer? Assume you have given a valid reason for reassignment and the editor is convinced.
 - If you request to reassign a reviewer, can the new reviewer see the previous reviews/scores before submitting his own review? Or he would access to the previous revision after submitting his own review.
 I already know (have heard) that in many cases reviewers are not available, and it becomes inevitable to get an entirely new set of reviews. I already know this. But my questions are about the case that the reviewer availability is not an issue. Juts trying to find out how things are managed

 My understanding is really rudimentaly, feel free to correct me pls:
  
Data scientist, this should be the most fitting and easy-to-get-interview position. Difficulty level 1/5.
 Data analyist, same as 1. Difficulty level 1/5.
 Data engineer, same as 1. Difficulty level 1/5.
 Machine learning engineer, has a higher bar than 1, 2, and 3, and it's very difficult to get interviews without proper background and work experience. So it's very difficult to become one for a masters graduate in DS, but it's quite possible for DS/DE (but much less so for DA) to make into MLE positions. Difficulty level 3/5.
 Software engineer, it's totally another realm, and has very few skill overlap with 1, 2, and 3. So it's very hard to make the transition or land a SWE job for DS students. Difficulty level 5/5.

The classic RL book from Sutton/Barto and the new RL theory book from Agarwal/Jiang/Kakade/Sun both stick to finite MDPs except for special cases like linear MDPs and the LQR.
 I assume that a general statement of the fundamentals for continuous spaces will require grinding through a lot of details on existence, measurability, suprema vs. maxima, etc., that are not issues in the finite case. Is this why these authors avoid it?
 clarifying edit: I don't need to go all the way to continuous time - just state and action spaces.
 Maybe one of Bertsekas's books?

 Yesterday I posted a legitimate question about databases choices in r/MachineLearning. This was about what technical choices ML members are currently using for large scale data ingestion in a continual learning environment. The post was removed. That post was neither a (1) beginner nor (2) offensive and (3) aimed to be a constructive discussion suitable as mid-range ML query and (4) marked with appropriate flair I finally posted it elsewhere.
 Yet today I see questions about transitions between DS -> MLE and quirky labgroup names which can be used from ML terms. These aren't even research questions.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Any reinforcement learning problem can be modeled as a sequential decision problem (SDP), which can always be modeled as a Markov decision process. An example of an SDP is a multiarmed bandit problem, where the state is the vector of beliefs about the performance of each arm (or beliefs about a continuous parametric model). Decisions are made by a policy, and there are four classes of policies. For some reason, the RL community tends to focus on just one of the four classes (UCB policies, which fall in the class of cost function approximations), but there are entire communities using each of the other three classes. See chapter 7 of my new book for a complete summary of the four classes for pure learning problems (aka bandit problems). See https://tinyurl.com/RLandSO/ Curious why Sutton and Barto (2nd edition) cover bandit problems in chapter 2, and then introduce MDPs in chapter 3. A bandit problem *is* an MDP!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So I watched this old video by Microsoft Research: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psA4U6nhZ70 
 To summarize, it uses the fairness criteria that sensitive attribute A will give the same prediction regardless of the value, when using counterfactuals. That is, if you're male or female, it shouldn't influence the models predictions. 
 The idea seems decent at first glance. But what if the "bias" or "unfairness" that the model creates based on sensitive attribute A isn't caused by a dataset bias but rather detects a real signal in the data?
 The model proposed by Microsoft Research doesn't take into consideration that the prediction on the sensitive attribute A does not necessarily consist of ONLY unfairness. They simply define it as such. 
 Is such an algorithmic design choice not exactly one of the flaws that we seek to eliminate? Assuming, that not all of the imbalance in predictions by the model on the sensitive attribute A is caused by "unfairness" but that some of it is caused by an inherent difference, then are they not introducing direct human bias and unfairness into their model by explicitedly designing the system to fit their own human (and political) bias? 
 Don't get me wrong; the opposite is just as bad. Assuming that ALL of the imbalance in the prediction on the sensitive attribute A is caused by "inherent differences" is just as bad. 
 Do you know of anyone that has tackled this in a good manner? How would you even begin to estimate how much is due to an "inherent difference" and how much is due to "bias, unfairness, noise" (or otherwise)?

 Search engines work by building an index and then looking up things in it. Usually, that index is a separate data structure. In keyword search, we build and store reverse indices. In neural search, we build nearest-neighbor indices. This paper does something different: It directly trains a Transformer to return the ID of the most relevant document. No similarity search over embeddings or anything like this is performed, and no external data structure is needed, as the entire index is essentially captured by the model's weights. The paper experiments with various ways of representing documents and training the system, which works surprisingly well!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello, I'm currently learning about MDPs and machine learning. I have a few questions that might be trivial or obvious but I can't find many concrete answers online:
 -Are policy gradient and policy iteration similar/the same? From what I can gather, policy iteration is a type or subset of policy gradient algorithm, is this correct?
 -Are all policy learning methods less effective for large state spaces? From my understanding you need to use some kind of value function iteration and heursitic function for larger state spaces because you can't encounter all states enough times to converge on an optimal policy
 -Does convergence on a policy/value function find a local or global optimum? With neural nets, simple backpropagation may only find a local minimum for the cost function, is this true of MDP/RL iteration algorithms? 
 Thanks!!

Feathr is used by dozens of LinkedIn applications to define features, compute them for training, deploy them in production, and share them across consumers. Compared to previous application-specific feature pipeline solutions, Feathr users reported significantly reduced time required to add new features to model training and improved runtime performance.
 Hundreds of ML models run on LinkedIn in Search, Feed, and Ads applications. Thousands of features about entities in the Economic Graph, such as companies, job postings, and LinkedIn members, power the models. The most time-consuming aspects of handling the ML applications at scale have been preparing and managing features.

high-speed Internet. However, optical fibers, serving as the data transmission
medium providing connectivity to billons of users worldwide, are prone to a
variety of anomalies resulting from hard failures (e.g., fiber cuts) and
malicious physical attacks (e.g., optical eavesdropping (fiber tapping)) etc.
Such anomalies may cause network disruption and thereby inducing huge financial
and data losses, or compromise the confidentiality of optical networks by
gaining unauthorized access to the carried data, or gradually degrade the
network operations. Therefore, it is highly required to implement efficient
anomaly detection, diagnosis, and localization schemes for enhancing the
availability and reliability of optical networks. In this paper, we propose a
data driven approach to accurately and quickly detect, diagnose, and localize
fiber anomalies including fiber cuts, and optical eavesdropping attacks. The
proposed method combines an autoencoder-based anomaly detection and an
attention-based bidirectional gated recurrent unit algorithm, whereby the
former is used for fault detection and the latter is adopted for fault
diagnosis and localization once an anomaly is detected by the autoencoder. We
verify the efficiency of our proposed approach by experiments under various
anomaly scenarios using real operational data. The experimental results
demonstrate that: (i) the autoencoder detects any fiber fault or anomaly with
an F1 score of 96.86%; and (ii) the attention-based bidirectional gated
recurrent unit algorithm identifies the the detected anomalies with an average
accuracy of 98.2%, and localizes the faults with an average root mean square
error of 0.19 m.]]></summary>

two-player min-max (i.e, zero-sum) games. In this paper, we investigate the
behavior of no-regret learning in min-max games with dependent strategy sets,
where the strategy of the first player constrains the behavior of the second.
Such games are best understood as sequential, i.e., min-max Stackelberg, games.
We consider two settings, one in which only the first player chooses their
actions using a no-regret algorithm while the second player best responds, and
one in which both players use no-regret algorithms. For the former case, we
show that no-regret dynamics converge to a Stackelberg equilibrium. For the
latter case, we introduce a new type of regret, which we call Lagrangian
regret, and show that if both players minimize their Lagrangian regrets, then
play converges to a Stackelberg equilibrium. We then observe that online mirror
descent (OMD) dynamics in these two settings correspond respectively to a known
nested (i.e., sequential) gradient descent-ascent (GDA) algorithm and a new
simultaneous GDA-like algorithm, thereby establishing convergence of these
algorithms to Stackelberg equilibrium. Finally, we analyze the robustness of
OMD dynamics to perturbations by investigating online min-max Stackelberg
games. We prove that OMD dynamics are robust for a large class of online
min-max games with independent strategy sets. In the dependent case, we
demonstrate the robustness of OMD dynamics experimentally by simulating them in
online Fisher markets, a canonical example of a min-max Stackelberg game with
dependent strategy sets.]]></summary>

semantic classes in a classifier's training set is critical to practical
deployment of the model. This task is termed open-set recognition (OSR) and has
received significant attention in recent years. In this paper, we first
demonstrate that the ability of a classifier to make the 'none-of-above'
decision is highly correlated with its accuracy on the closed-set classes. We
find that this relationship holds across loss objectives and architectures, and
further demonstrate the trend both on the standard OSR benchmarks as well as on
a large-scale ImageNet evaluation. Second, we use this correlation to boost the
performance of a maximum logit score OSR 'baseline' by improving its closed-set
accuracy, and with this strong baseline achieve state-of-the-art on a number of
OSR benchmarks. Similarly, we boost the performance of the existing
state-of-the-art method by improving its closed-set accuracy, but the resulting
discrepancy with the strong baseline is marginal. Our third contribution is to
present the 'Semantic Shift Benchmark' (SSB), which better respects the task of
detecting semantic novelty, in contrast to other forms of distribution shift
also considered in related sub-fields, such as out-of-distribution detection.
On this new evaluation, we again demonstrate that there is negligible
difference between the strong baseline and the existing state-of-the-art.

forecasting and decision-based optimization. Traditionally, predictive models
are optimized independently from the final decision-based optimization problem.
In contrast, a `smart, predict then optimize' (SPO) framework optimizes
prediction models to explicitly minimize the final downstream decision loss. In
this paper we present dboost, a gradient boosting algorithm for training
prediction model ensembles to minimize decision regret. The dboost framework
supports any convex optimization program that can be cast as convex quadratic
cone program and gradient boosting is performed by implicit differentiation of
a custom fixed-point mapping. To our knowledge, the dboost framework is the
first general purpose implementation of gradient boosting to predict and

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We introduce YOLO-pose, a novel heatmap-free approach for joint detection,
and 2D multi-person pose estimation in an image based on the popular YOLO
object detection framework. Existing heatmap based two-stage approaches are
sub-optimal as they are not end-to-end trainable and training relies on a
surrogate L1 loss that is not equivalent to maximizing the evaluation metric,
i.e. Object Keypoint Similarity (OKS). Our framework allows us to train the
model end-to-end and optimize the OKS metric itself. The proposed model learns
to jointly detect bounding boxes for multiple persons and their corresponding
2D poses in a single forward pass and thus bringing in the best of both
top-down and bottom-up approaches. Proposed approach doesn't require the
postprocessing of bottom-up approaches to group detected keypoints into a
skeleton as each bounding box has an associated pose, resulting in an inherent
grouping of the keypoints. Unlike top-down approaches, multiple forward passes
are done away with since all persons are localized along with their pose in a
single inference. YOLO-pose achieves new state-of-the-art results on COCO
validation (90.2% AP50) and test-dev set (90.3% AP50), surpassing all existing
bottom-up approaches in a single forward pass without flip test, multi-scale
testing, or any other test time augmentation. All experiments and results
reported in this paper are without any test time augmentation, unlike
traditional approaches that use flip-test and multi-scale testing to boost
performance. Our training codes will be made publicly available at

detection is usually the first step. Thus, it carries great weight in
determining the performance of people detection and people tracking. However,
many leg detectors ignore the inevitable noise and the multiscale
characteristics of the laser scan, which makes them sensitive to the unreliable
features of point cloud and further degrades the performance of the leg
detector. In this paper, we propose a multiscale adaptive-switch Random Forest
(MARF) to overcome these two challenges. Firstly, the adaptive-switch decision
tree is designed to use noisesensitive features to conduct weighted
classification and noiseinvariant features to conduct binary classification,
which makes our detector perform more robust to noise. Secondly, considering
the multiscale property that the sparsity of the 2D point cloud is proportional
to the length of laser beams, we design a multiscale random forest structure to
detect legs at different distances. Moreover, the proposed approach allows us
to discover a sparser human leg from point clouds than others. Consequently,
our method shows an improved performance compared to other state-of-the-art leg
detectors on the challenging Moving Legs dataset and retains the whole pipeline
at a speed of 60+ FPS on lowcomputational laptops. Moreover, we further apply
the proposed MARF to the people detection and tracking system, achieving a
considerable gain in all metrics.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Vision Transformers (ViTs) take all the image patches as tokens and construct
multi-head self-attention (MHSA) among them. Complete leverage of these image
tokens brings redundant computations since not all the tokens are attentive in
MHSA. Examples include that tokens containing semantically meaningless or
distractive image backgrounds do not positively contribute to the ViT
predictions. In this work, we propose to reorganize image tokens during the
feed-forward process of ViT models, which is integrated into ViT during
training. For each forward inference, we identify the attentive image tokens
between MHSA and FFN (i.e., feed-forward network) modules, which is guided by
the corresponding class token attention. Then, we reorganize image tokens by
preserving attentive image tokens and fusing inattentive ones to expedite
subsequent MHSA and FFN computations. To this end, our method EViT improves
ViTs from two perspectives. First, under the same amount of input image tokens,
our method reduces MHSA and FFN computation for efficient inference. For
instance, the inference speed of DeiT-S is increased by 50% while its
recognition accuracy is decreased by only 0.3% for ImageNet classification.
Second, by maintaining the same computational cost, our method empowers ViTs to
take more image tokens as input for recognition accuracy improvement, where the
image tokens are from higher resolution images. An example is that we improve
the recognition accuracy of DeiT-S by 1% for ImageNet classification at the
same computational cost of a vanilla DeiT-S. Meanwhile, our method does not
introduce more parameters to ViTs. Experiments on the standard benchmarks show
the effectiveness of our method. The code is available at

residential load data. Such task is referred as non-intrusive load monitoring
(NILM), and in order to find individual devices' power consumption profiles
based on aggregated meter measurements, a machine learning model is usually
trained based on large amount of training data coming from a number of
residential homes. Yet collecting such residential load datasets require both
huge efforts and customers' approval on sharing metering data, while load data
coming from different regions or electricity users may exhibit heterogeneous
usage patterns. Both practical concerns make training a single, centralized
NILM model challenging. In this paper, we propose a decentralized and
task-adaptive learning scheme for NILM tasks, where nested meta learning and
federated learning steps are designed for learning task-specific models
collectively. Simulation results on benchmark dataset validate proposed
algorithm's performance on efficiently inferring appliance-level consumption

features on the prediction fosters model explainability and delivers relevant
information about the dataset. While typical setups for feature importance
ranking assess input features individually, in this study, we go one step
further and rank the importance of groups of features, denoted as
feature-blocks. A feature-block can contain features of a specific type or
features derived from a particular source, which are presented to the neural
network in separate input branches (multiblock ANNs). This work presents three
methods pursuing distinct strategies to rank features in multiblock ANNs by
their importance: (1) a composite strategy building on individual feature
importance rankings, (2) a knock-in, and (3) a knock-out strategy. While the
composite strategy builds on state-of-the-art feature importance rankings,
knock-in and knock-out strategies evaluate the block as a whole via a mutual
information criterion. Our experiments consist of a simulation study validating
all three approaches, followed by a case study on two distinct real-world
datasets to compare the strategies. We conclude that each strategy has its
merits for specific application scenarios.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Multiscale topology optimization (M-TO) entails generating an optimal global
topology, and an optimal set of microstructures at a smaller scale, for a
physics-constrained problem. With the advent of additive manufacturing, M-TO
has gained significant prominence. However, generating optimal microstructures
at various locations can be computationally very expensive. As an alternate,
graded multiscale topology optimization (GM-TO) has been proposed where one or
more pre-selected and graded (parameterized) microstructural topologies are
used to fill the domain optimally. This leads to a significant reduction in
computation while retaining many of the benefits of M-TO.

A successful GM-TO framework must: (1) be capable of efficiently handling
numerous pre-selected microstructures, (2) be able to continuously switch
between these microstructures during optimization, (3) ensure that the
partition of unity is satisfied, and (4) discourage microstructure mixing at
termination.

In this paper, we propose to meet these requirements by exploiting the unique
classification capacity of neural networks. Specifically, we propose a graded
multiscale topology optimization using neural-network (GM-TOuNN) framework with
the following features: (1) the number of design variables is only weakly
dependent on the number of pre-selected microstructures, (2) it guarantees
partition of unity while discouraging microstructure mixing, and (3) it
supports automatic differentiation, thereby eliminating manual sensitivity
analysis. The proposed framework is illustrated through several examples.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Purpose: (1) To assess the performance of geometric deep learning (PointNet)
in diagnosing glaucoma from a single optical coherence tomography (OCT) 3D scan
of the optic nerve head (ONH); (2) To compare its performance to that obtained
with a standard 3D convolutional neural network (CNN), and with a gold-standard
glaucoma parameter, i.e. retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) thickness.

Methods: 3D raster scans of the ONH were acquired with Spectralis OCT for 477
glaucoma and 2,296 non-glaucoma subjects at the Singapore National Eye Centre.
All volumes were automatically segmented using deep learning to identify 7
major neural and connective tissues including the RNFL, the prelamina, and the
lamina cribrosa (LC). Each ONH was then represented as a 3D point cloud with
1,000 points chosen randomly from all tissue boundaries. To simplify the
problem, all ONH point clouds were aligned with respect to the plane and center
of Bruch's membrane opening. Geometric deep learning (PointNet) was then used
to provide a glaucoma diagnosis from a single OCT point cloud. The performance
of our approach was compared to that obtained with a 3D CNN, and with RNFL
thickness.

Results: PointNet was able to provide a robust glaucoma diagnosis solely from
the ONH represented as a 3D point cloud (AUC=95%). The performance of PointNet
was superior to that obtained with a standard 3D CNN (AUC=87%) and with that
obtained from RNFL thickness alone (AUC=80%).

Discussion: We provide a proof-of-principle for the application of geometric
deep learning in the field of glaucoma. Our technique requires significantly
less information as input to perform better than a 3D CNN, and with an AUC
superior to that obtained from RNFL thickness alone. Geometric deep learning
may have wide applicability in the field of Ophthalmology.]]></summary>

implementation of GNN designs. We conduct extensive experiments on datasets
across cohorts and modalities and recommend a set of general recipes for
effective GNN designs on brain networks. To support open and reproducible

requires large amounts of training data to work effectively. Recent work has
attempted to address this issue by leveraging differentiable simulators.
However, inherent problems such as local minima and exploding/vanishing

control tasks with complex contact-rich dynamics, such as humanoid locomotion
in classical RL benchmarks. In this work we present a high-performance
differentiable simulator and a new policy learning algorithm (SHAC) that can
effectively leverage simulation gradients, even in the presence of
non-smoothness. Our learning algorithm alleviates problems with local minima
through a smooth critic function, avoids vanishing/exploding gradients through
a truncated learning window, and allows many physical environments to be run in
parallel. We evaluate our method on classical RL control tasks, and show
substantial improvements in sample efficiency and wall-clock time over
state-of-the-art RL and differentiable simulation-based algorithms. In
addition, we demonstrate the scalability of our method by applying it to the

domains, ranging from product reviews in retailing to nursing notes in
healthcare. To leverage this information, words are typically translated into
word embeddings -- vectors that encode the semantic relationships between words
-- through unsupervised learning algorithms such as matrix factorization.
However, learning word embeddings from new domains with limited training data
can be challenging, because the meaning/usage may be different in the new
domain, e.g., the word "positive" typically has positive sentiment, but often
has negative sentiment in medical notes since it may imply that a patient is
tested positive for a disease. Intuitively, we expect that only a small number
of domain-specific words may have new meanings/usages. We propose an intuitive
two-stage estimator that exploits this structure via a group-sparse penalty to
efficiently transfer learn domain-specific word embeddings by combining
large-scale text corpora (such as Wikipedia) with limited domain-specific text
data. We bound the generalization error of our estimator, proving that it can
achieve the same accuracy (compared to not transfer learning) with
substantially less domain-specific data when only a small number of embeddings
are altered between domains. Our results provide the first bounds on
group-sparse matrix factorization, which may be of independent interest. We

and services at which customers target their opinions and sentiments. Aspect
detection helps product owners and service providers to identify shortcomings
and prioritize customers' needs, and hence, maintain revenues and mitigate
customer churn. Existing methods focus on detecting the surface form of an
aspect by training supervised learning methods that fall short when aspects are
latent in reviews. In this paper, we propose an unsupervised method to extract
latent occurrences of aspects. Specifically, we assume that a customer
undergoes a two-stage hypothetical generative process when writing a review:
(1) deciding on an aspect amongst the set of aspects available for the product
or service, and (2) writing the opinion words that are more interrelated to the
chosen aspect from the set of all words available in a language. We employ
latent Dirichlet allocation to learn the latent aspects distributions for
generating the reviews. Experimental results on benchmark datasets show that
our proposed method is able to improve the state of the art when the aspects
are latent with no surface form in reviews.]]></summary>

and scalable hierarchical transformer that works well on both image
classification and downstream vision tasks. It is built upon Neighborhood
Attention (NA), a simple and flexible attention mechanism that localizes the
receptive field for each query to its nearest neighboring pixels. NA is a
localization of self-attention, and approaches it as the receptive field size
increases. It is also equivalent in FLOPs and memory usage to Swin
Transformer's shifted window attention given the same receptive field size,
while being less constrained. Furthermore, NA includes local inductive biases,
which eliminate the need for extra operations such as pixel shifts.
Experimental results on NAT are competitive; NAT-Tiny reaches 83.2% top-1
accuracy on ImageNet with only 4.3 GFLOPs and 28M parameters, 51.4% mAP on
MS-COCO and 48.4% mIoU on ADE20k. We will open-source our checkpoints, training

show how linear, i.e., linearly activated recurrent neural networks (LRNNs) can
approximate any time-dependent function f(t) given by a number of function
values. The approximation can effectively be learned by simply solving a linear
equation system; no backpropagation or similar methods are needed. Furthermore,
the size of an LRNN can be reduced significantly in one step, after inspecting
the eigenvalues of the network transition matrix, by taking only the most
relevant components. Therefore, in contrast to others, we do not only learn
network weights but also the network architecture. LRNNs have interesting
properties: They end up in ellipse trajectories in the long run and allow the
prediction of further values and compact representations of functions. We
demonstrate this by several experiments, among them multiple superimposed
oscillators (MSO), robotic soccer, and predicting stock prices. LRNNs
outperform the previous state-of-the-art for the MSO task with a minimal number

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Graph neural networks (GNN) are very popular methods in machine learning and
have been applied very successfully to the prediction of the properties of
molecules and materials. First-order GNNs are well known to be incomplete,
i.e., there exist graphs that are distinct but appear identical when seen
through the lens of the GNN. More complicated schemes have thus been designed
to increase their resolving power. Applications to molecules (and more
generally, point clouds), however, add a geometric dimension to the problem.
The most straightforward and prevalent approach to construct graph
representation for molecules regards atoms as vertices in a graph and draws a
bond between each pair of atoms within a chosen cutoff. Bonds can be decorated
with the distance between atoms, and the resulting "distance graph NNs" (dGNN)
have empirically demonstrated excellent resolving power and are widely used in
chemical ML, with all known indistinguishable graphs being resolved in the
fully-connected limit. Here we show that even for the restricted case of
fully-connected graphs induced by 3D atom clouds dGNNs are not complete. We
construct pairs of distinct point clouds that generate graphs that, for any
cutoff radius, are equivalent based on a first-order Weisfeiler-Lehman test.
This class of degenerate structures includes chemically-plausible
configurations, setting an ultimate limit to the expressive power of some of
the well-established GNN architectures for atomistic machine learning. Models
that explicitly use angular or directional information in the description of
atomic environments can resolve these degeneracies.]]></summary>

models is a challenging yet important problem for analyzing, transforming and
generating various types of data. In speech processing, inspiring from the
anatomical mechanisms of phonation, the source-filter model considers that
speech signals are produced from a few independent and physically meaningful
continuous latent factors, among which the fundamental frequency $f_0$ and the
formants are of primary importance. In this work, we show that the
source-filter model of speech production naturally arises in the latent space
of a variational autoencoder (VAE) trained in an unsupervised manner on a
dataset of natural speech signals. Using only a few seconds of labeled speech
signals generated with an artificial speech synthesizer, we experimentally
illustrate that $f_0$ and the formant frequencies are encoded in orthogonal
subspaces of the VAE latent space and we develop a weakly-supervised method to
accurately and independently control these speech factors of variation within
the learned latent subspaces. Without requiring additional information such as
text or human-labeled data, this results in a deep generative model of speech
spectrograms that is conditioned on $f_0$ and the formant frequencies, and
which is applied to the transformation of speech signals.]]></summary>

protein sequences capture a representation of protein families and learn
constraints associated to protein structure and function. They thus open the
possibility for generating novel sequences belonging to protein families.
Protein language models trained on multiple sequence alignments, such as MSA
Transformer, are highly attractive candidates to this end. We propose and test
an iterative method that directly uses the masked language modeling objective
to generate sequences using MSA Transformer. We demonstrate that the resulting
sequences generally score better than those generated by Potts models, and even
than natural sequences, for homology, coevolution and structure-based measures.
Moreover, MSA Transformer better reproduces the higher-order statistics and the
distribution of sequences in sequence space of natural data than Potts models,
although Potts models better reproduce first- and second-order statistics. MSA
Transformer is thus a strong candidate for protein sequence generation and
protein design.]]></summary>

of these cases, the observation cost of each entry is uniform and has the same
cost across the columns. However, in many real-life scenarios, we could expect
elements from distinct columns or distinct positions to have a different cost.
In this paper, we explore this generalization under adaptive conditions. We
approach the problem under two different cost models. The first one is that
entries from different columns have different observation costs, but, within
the same column, each entry has a uniform cost. The second one is any two entry
has different observation cost, despite being the same or different columns. We

Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices to learn a collaborative model without sending
the raw data to centralized nodes for processing. Despite numerous advantages,
low computing resources at IoT devices and high communication costs for
exchanging model parameters make applications of FL in massive IoT networks
very limited. In this work, we develop a novel compression scheme for FL,
called high-compression federated learning (HCFL), for very large scale IoT
networks. HCFL can reduce the data load for FL processes without changing their
structure and hyperparameters. In this way, we not only can significantly
reduce communication costs, but also make intensive learning processes more
adaptable on low-computing resource IoT devices. Furthermore, we investigate a
relationship between the number of IoT devices and the convergence level of the
FL model and thereby better assess the quality of the FL process. We
demonstrate our HCFL scheme in both simulations and mathematical analyses. Our
proposed theoretical research can be used as a minimum level of satisfaction,
proving that the FL process can achieve good performance when a determined
configuration is met. Therefore, we show that HCFL is applicable in any
FL-integrated networks with numerous IoT devices.]]></summary>

performances of an artificial interbank market. Financial institutions
stipulate lending agreements following a public recommendation and their
individual information. The former, modeled by a reinforcement learning optimal
policy trying to maximize the long term fitness of the system, gathers
information on the economic environment and directs economic actors to create
credit relationships based on the optimal choice between a low interest rate or
high liquidity supply. The latter, based on the agents' balance sheet, allows
to determine the liquidity supply and interest rate that the banks optimally
offer on the market. Based on the combination between the public and the
private signal, financial institutions create or cut their credit connections
over time via a preferential attachment evolving procedure able to generate a
dynamic network. Our results show that the emergence of a core-periphery
interbank network, combined with a certain level of homogeneity on the size of
lenders and borrowers, are essential features to ensure the resilience of the
system. Moreover, the reinforcement learning optimal policy recommendation
plays a crucial role in mitigating systemic risk with respect to alternative

classification has attracted increasing attention to address the data imbalance
problem by distinguishing the samples of the minority class from the majority
class. Previous methods generally aim to either learn a new feature space to
map training samples together or to fit training samples by autoencoder-like
models. These methods mainly focus on capturing either compact or descriptive
features, where the information of the samples of a given one class is not
sufficiently utilized. In this paper, we propose a novel deep learning-based
method to learn compact features by adding constraints on the bottleneck
features, and to preserve descriptive features by training an autoencoder at
the same time. Through jointly optimizing the constraining loss and the
autoencoder's reconstruction loss, our method can learn more relevant features
associated with the given class, making the majority and minority samples more
distinguishable. Experimental results on three clinical datasets (including the
MRI breast images, FFDM breast images and chest X-ray images) obtains
state-of-art performance compared to previous methods.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[To improve predictive models for STEM applications, supplemental
physics-based features computed from input parameters are introduced into
single and multiple layers of a deep neural network (DNN). While many studies
focus on informing DNNs with physics through differential equations or
numerical simulation, much may be gained through integration of simplified
relationships. To evaluate this hypothesis, a number of thin rectangular plates
simply-supported on all edges are simulated for five materials. With plate
dimensions and material properties as input features and fundamental natural
frequency as the sole output, predictive performance of a purely data-driven
DNN-based model is compared with models using additional inputs computed from
simplified physical relationships among baseline parameters, namely plate
weight, modulus of rigidity, and shear modulus. To better understand the
benefit to model accuracy, these additional features are injected into various
single and multiple DNN layers, and trained with four different dataset sizes.
When these physics-enhanced models are evaluated against independent data of
the same materials and similar dimensions to the training sets, supplementation
with simplified physics-based parameters provides little reduction in
prediction error over the baseline for models trained with dataset sizes of 60
and greater, although small improvement from 19.3% to 16.1% occurs when trained
with a sparse size of 30. Conversely, notable accuracy gains occur when the
independent test data is of material and dimensions not conforming to the
training set. Specifically, when physics-enhanced data is injected into
multiple DNN layers, reductions in error from 33.2% to 19.6%, 34.9% to 19.9%,
35.8% to 22.4%, and 43.0% to 28.4% are achieved for training dataset sizes of
261, 117, 60, and 30, respectively, demonstrating attainment of a degree of

shape datasets that contain instances with consistent position and orientation

self-supervised method that learns to Canonicalize the 3D orientation and

translation-invariant 3D networks. During inference, our method takes an unseen
full or partial 3D point cloud at an arbitrary pose and outputs an equivariant
canonical pose. During training, this network uses self-supervision losses to
learn the canonical pose from an un-canonicalized collection of full and
partial 3D point clouds. ConDor can also learn to consistently co-segment
object parts without any supervision. Extensive quantitative results on four
new metrics show that our approach outperforms existing methods while enabling

their characterization challenging. We consider two settings for the two input
variables, either both are random variables or one is a random variable and the
other is well-separated, i.e. there is a minimum distance between points. With
conditions on the dimension, the complexity ratio, and the sampling variance,
we show that the singular values of these matrices concentrate near their full
expectation and near one with high-probability. In particular, since the
dimension depends only on the logarithm of the number of random weights or the
number of data points, our complexity bounds can be achieved even in moderate
dimensions for many practical setting. The theoretical results are verified

non-additive metrics that allows for the identification and interpretation of
contributing factors (input features) of variance. Non-additive metrics, such
as ratios, are widely used in a variety of domains. It commonly requires
preceding aggregations of underlying variables that are used to calculate the
metric of interest. The latest poses a dimensionality challenge when the input
features and underlying variables are formed as two-dimensional arrays along
elements, such as account or customer identifications, and time points. It
rules out direct modeling of the time series of a non-additive metric as a
function of input features. The article discusses a five-step approach: (1)
segmentations of input features and the underlying variables of the metric that
are supported by unsupervised autoencoders, (2) univariate or joint fittings of
the metric by the aggregated input features on the segmented domains, (3)
transformations of pre-screened input features according to the fitted models,
(4) aggregation of the transformed features as time series, and (5) modelling
of the metric time series as a sum of constrained linear effects of the
aggregated features. Alternatively, approximation by numerical differentiation
has been considered to linearize the metric. It allows for element level
univariate or joint modeling of step (2). The process of these analytical steps
allows for a backward-looking explanatory decomposition of the metric as a sum
of time series of the survived input features. The paper includes a synthetic
example that studies loss-to-balance monthly rates of a hypothetical retail
credit portfolio. To validate that no latent factors other than the survived
input features have significant impacts on the metric, Statistical Process
Control has been introduced for the residual time series.]]></summary>

demonstrate how confidence intervals around accuracy measurements can greatly
enhance the communication of research results as well as impact the reviewing
process. In addition, we explore the hallmarks and limitations of this
approximation. We discuss the relevance of this approach reflecting on a
spotlight publication of ICLR22. A reproducible workflow is made available as
an open-source adjoint to this publication. Based on our discussion, we make
suggestions for improving the authoring and reviewing process of machine

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Many applications of representation learning, such as privacy-preservation,
algorithmic fairness, and domain adaptation, desire explicit control over
semantic information being discarded. This goal is formulated as satisfying two
objectives: maximizing utility for predicting a target attribute while
simultaneously being independent or invariant with respect to a known semantic
attribute. Solutions to such problems lead to trade-offs between the two
objectives when they are competing with each other. While existing works study
bounds on these trade-offs, three questions still remain outstanding:
\emph{What are the exact fundamental trade-offs between utility and
invariance?}, 2) \emph{What is the optimal dimensionality of the
representation?}, and 3) \emph{What are the encoders (mapping data to a
representation) that achieve the exact fundamental trade-offs and how can we
estimate them from data?} This paper addresses these questions. We adopt a
functional analysis perspective and derive closed-form solutions for the global
optima of the underlying optimization problems under mild assumptions, which in
turn yields closed formulae for the exact trade-offs, optimal representation
dimensionality, and the corresponding encoders. We also numerically quantify
the trade-offs on representative problems and compare them to those achieved by
baseline invariant representation learning algorithms.]]></summary>

frameworks treat them discretely in time. In this work, we think of videos of
what they should be $-$ time-continuous signals, and extend the paradigm of
neural representations to build a continuous-time video generator. For this, we
first design continuous motion representations through the lens of positional
embeddings. Then, we explore the question of training on very sparse videos and
demonstrate that a good generator can be learned by using as few as 2 frames
per clip. After that, we rethink the traditional image + video discriminators
pair and design a holistic discriminator that aggregates temporal information
by simply concatenating frames' features. This decreases the training cost and
provides richer learning signal to the generator, making it possible to train
directly on 1024$^2$ videos for the first time. We build our model on top of
StyleGAN2 and it is just ${\approx}5\%$ more expensive to train at the same
resolution while achieving almost the same image quality. Moreover, our latent
space features similar properties, enabling spatial manipulations that our
method can propagate in time. We can generate arbitrarily long videos at
arbitrary high frame rate, while prior work struggles to generate even 64
frames at a fixed rate. Our model is tested on four modern 256$^2$ and one
1024$^2$-resolution video synthesis benchmarks. In terms of sheer metrics, it
performs on average ${\approx}30\%$ better than the closest runner-up. Project

$\mathbb{P}$ more effectively than i.i.d. sampling or standard thinning. Given
a suitable reproducing kernel $\mathbf{k}$ and $\mathcal{O}(n^2)$ time, kernel
thinning compresses an $n$-point approximation to $\mathbb{P}$ into a
$\sqrt{n}$-point approximation with comparable worst-case integration error
across the associated reproducing kernel Hilbert space. With high probability,
the maximum discrepancy in integration error is
$\mathcal{O}_d(n^{-1/2}\sqrt{\log n})$ for compactly supported $\mathbb{P}$ and
$\mathcal{O}_d(n^{-\frac{1}{2}} (\log n)^{(d+1)/2}\sqrt{\log\log n})$ for
sub-exponential $\mathbb{P}$ on $\mathbb{R}^d$. In contrast, an equal-sized
i.i.d. sample from $\mathbb{P}$ suffers $\Omega(n^{-1/4})$ integration error.
Our sub-exponential guarantees resemble the classical quasi-Monte Carlo error
rates for uniform $\mathbb{P}$ on $[0,1]^d$ but apply to general distributions
on $\mathbb{R}^d$ and a wide range of common kernels. We use our results to
derive explicit non-asymptotic maximum mean discrepancy bounds for Gaussian,
Mat\'ern, and B-spline kernels and present two vignettes illustrating the
practical benefits of kernel thinning over i.i.d. sampling and standard Markov
chain Monte Carlo thinning, in dimensions $d=2$ through $100$.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Spectral geometric methods have brought revolutionary changes to the field of
geometry processing. Of particular interest is the study of the Laplacian
spectrum as a compact, isometry and permutation-invariant representation of a
shape. Some recent works show how the intrinsic geometry of a full shape can be
recovered from its spectrum, but there are approaches that consider the more
challenging problem of recovering the geometry from the spectral information of
partial shapes. In this paper, we propose a possible way to fill this gap. We
introduce a learning-based method to estimate the Laplacian spectrum of the
union of partial non-rigid 3D shapes, without actually computing the 3D
geometry of the union or any correspondence between those partial shapes. We do
so by operating purely in the spectral domain and by defining the union
operation between short sequences of eigenvalues. We show that the approximated
union spectrum can be used as-is to reconstruct the complete geometry [MRC*19],
perform region localization on a template [RTO*19] and retrieve shapes from a
database, generalizing ShapeDNA [RWP06] to work with partialities. Working with
eigenvalues allows us to deal with unknown correspondence, different sampling,
and different discretizations (point clouds and meshes alike), making this
operation especially robust and general. Our approach is data-driven and can
generalize to isometric and non-isometric deformations of the surface, as long
as these stay within the same semantic class (e.g., human bodies or horses), as
well as to partiality artifacts not seen at training time.]]></summary>

learn task-specific features from data. Due to this data-driven nature, they
have achieved remarkable success in various areas. However, manual design and
selection of suitable network architectures are time-consuming and require
substantial effort of human experts. To address this problem, researchers have
proposed neural architecture search (NAS) algorithms which can automatically
generate network architectures but suffer from heavy computational cost and
instability if searching from scratch. In this paper, we propose a hybrid NAS
framework for ultrasound (US) image classification and segmentation. The hybrid
framework consists of a pre-trained backbone and several searched cells (i.e.,
network building blocks), which takes advantage of the strengths of both NAS
and the expert knowledge from existing convolutional neural networks.
Specifically, two effective and lightweight operations, a mixed depth-wise
convolution operator and a squeeze-and-excitation block, are introduced into
the candidate operations to enhance the variety and capacity of the searched
cells. These two operations not only decrease model parameters but also boost
network performance. Moreover, we propose a re-aggregation strategy for the
searched cells, aiming to further improve the performance for different vision
tasks. We tested our method on two large US image datasets, including a 9-class
echinococcosis dataset containing 9566 images for classification and an ovary
dataset containing 3204 images for segmentation. Ablation experiments and
comparison with other handcrafted or automatically searched architectures
demonstrate that our method can generate more powerful and lightweight models

However, this strongly limits the use of these models inside audio generation
setups, as most creative workflows are based on real-time digital signal
processing. Although approaches based on recurrent networks can be naturally
adapted to this buffer-based computation, the use of convolutions still poses
some serious challenges. To tackle this issue, the use of causal streaming
convolutions have been proposed. However, this requires specific complexified
training and can impact the resulting audio quality.

In this paper, we introduce a new method allowing to produce non-causal
streaming models. This allows to make any convolutional model compatible with
real-time buffer-based processing. As our method is based on a post-training
reconfiguration of the model, we show that it is able to transform models
trained without causal constraints into a streaming model. We show how our
method can be adapted to fit complex architectures with parallel branches. To
evaluate our method, we apply it on the recent RAVE model, which provides
high-quality real-time audio synthesis. We test our approach on multiple music
and speech datasets and show that it is faster than overlap-add methods, while
having no impact on the generation quality. Finally, we introduce two
open-source implementation of our work as Max/MSP and PureData externals, and
as a VST audio plugin. This allows to endow traditional digital audio
workstation with real-time neural audio synthesis on a laptop CPU.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Purpose: The optic nerve head (ONH) undergoes complex and deep 3D
morphological changes during the development and progression of glaucoma.
Optical coherence tomography (OCT) is the current gold standard to visualize
and quantify these changes, however the resulting 3D deep-tissue information
has not yet been fully exploited for the diagnosis and prognosis of glaucoma.
To this end, we aimed: (1) To compare the performance of two relatively recent
geometric deep learning techniques in diagnosing glaucoma from a single OCT
scan of the ONH; and (2) To identify the 3D structural features of the ONH that
are critical for the diagnosis of glaucoma.

Methods: In this study, we included a total of 2,247 non-glaucoma and 2,259
glaucoma scans from 1,725 subjects. All subjects had their ONHs imaged in 3D
with Spectralis OCT. All OCT scans were automatically segmented using deep
learning to identify major neural and connective tissues. Each ONH was then
represented as a 3D point cloud. We used PointNet and dynamic graph
convolutional neural network (DGCNN) to diagnose glaucoma from such 3D ONH
point clouds and to identify the critical 3D structural features of the ONH for
glaucoma diagnosis.

Results: Both the DGCNN (AUC: 0.97$\pm$0.01) and PointNet (AUC:
0.95$\pm$0.02) were able to accurately detect glaucoma from 3D ONH point
clouds. The critical points formed an hourglass pattern with most of them
located in the inferior and superior quadrant of the ONH.

Discussion: The diagnostic accuracy of both geometric deep learning
approaches was excellent. Moreover, we were able to identify the critical 3D
structural features of the ONH for glaucoma diagnosis that tremendously
improved the transparency and interpretability of our method. Consequently, our
approach may have strong potential to be used in clinical applications for the
diagnosis and prognosis of a wide range of ophthalmic disorders.]]></summary>

data-driven approach. Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS) is utilized
as a data-driven technique to forecast this parameter at Tabriz in East
Azerbaijan. Various input patterns, namely T min, T max, and T mean, are
utilized for training the architecture whilst DPT is the model's output. The
findings indicate that, in general, ANFIS method is capable of identifying data
patterns with a high degree of accuracy. However, the approach demonstrates
that processing time and computer resources may substantially increase by
adding additional functions. Based on the results, the number of iterations and
computing resources might change dramatically if new functionalities are
included. As a result, tuning parameters have to be optimized inside the method
framework. The findings demonstrate a high agreement between results by the
data-driven technique (machine learning method) and the observed data. Using
this prediction toolkit, DPT can be adequately forecasted solely based on the
temperature distribution of Tabriz. This kind of modeling is extremely
promising for predicting DPT at various sites. Besides, this study thoroughly
compares the Bilayered Neural Network (BNN) and ANFIS models on various scales.
Whilst the ANFIS model is extremely stable for almost all numbers of membership
functions, the BNN model is highly sensitive to this scale factor to predict
DPT.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Semantic parsing (SP) is a core component of modern virtual assistants like
Google Assistant and Amazon Alexa. While sequence-to-sequence-based
auto-regressive (AR) approaches are common for conversational semantic parsing,
recent studies employ non-autoregressive (NAR) decoders and reduce inference
latency while maintaining competitive parsing quality. However, a major
drawback of NAR decoders is the difficulty of generating top-k (i.e., k-best)
outputs with approaches such as beam search. To address this challenge, we
propose a novel NAR semantic parser that introduces intent conditioning on the
decoder. Inspired by the traditional intent and slot tagging parsers, we
decouple the top-level intent prediction from the rest of a parse. As the
top-level intent largely governs the syntax and semantics of a parse, the
intent conditioning allows the model to better control beam search and improves
the quality and diversity of top-k outputs. We introduce a hybrid
teacher-forcing approach to avoid training and inference mismatch. We evaluate
the proposed NAR on conversational SP datasets, TOP & TOPv2. Like the existing
NAR models, we maintain the O(1) decoding time complexity while generating more
diverse outputs and improving the top-3 exact match (EM) by 2.4 points. In
comparison with AR models, our model speeds up beam search inference by 6.7
times on CPU with competitive top-k EM.]]></summary>

characterizing landscapes of single-objective continuous optimization problems.
Landscape insights are crucial both for problem understanding as well as for
assessing benchmark set diversity and composition. Despite the irrefutable
usefulness of these features, they suffer from their own ailments and
downsides. Hence, in this work we provide a collection of different approaches
to characterize optimization landscapes. Similar to conventional landscape
features, we require a small initial sample. However, instead of computing
features based on that sample, we develop alternative representations of the
original sample. These range from point clouds to 2D images and, therefore, are
entirely feature-free. We demonstrate and validate our devised methods on the
BBOB testbed and predict, with the help of Deep Learning, the high-level,
expert-based landscape properties such as the degree of multimodality and the
existence of funnel structures. The quality of our approaches is on par with
methods relying on the traditional landscape features. Thereby, we provide an
exciting new perspective on every research area which utilizes problem

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Topological Data Analysis (TDA) is a rigorous framework that borrows
techniques from geometric and algebraic topology, category theory, and
combinatorics in order to study the "shape" of such complex high-dimensional
data. Research in this area has grown significantly over the last several years
bringing a deeply rooted theory to bear on practical applications in areas such
as genomics, natural language processing, medicine, cybersecurity, energy, and
climate change. Within some of these areas, TDA has also been used to augment
AI and ML techniques.

We believe there is further utility to be gained in this space that can be
facilitated by a workshop bringing together experts (both theorists and
practitioners) and non-experts. Currently there is an active community of pure
mathematicians with research interests in developing and exploring the
theoretical and computational aspects of TDA. Applied mathematicians and other
practitioners are also present in community but do not represent a majority.
This speaks to the primary aim of this workshop which is to grow a wider
community of interest in TDA. By fostering meaningful exchanges between these
groups, from across the government, academia, and industry, we hope to create
new synergies that can only come through building a mutual comprehensive
awareness of the problem and solution spaces.]]></summary>

particular, we extend two frameworks for detecting the erroneous samples in

from leveraging the information about matching LFs and detect noisy samples
more accurately. We also introduce a new algorithm for denoising the weakly

temporal alignment is a time-exhausting manual work in preparing for the

singing voice generator jointly trained in an end-to-end manner. The model can
be fine-tuned by adjusting the amount of supervision with temporally aligned
melody labels. Through experiments in melody-unsupervision and semi-supervision

show that applying CSS only to the time-variant features and encouraging a
gradual transition on them between nearby and away frames while also
reconstructing the input, extract rich temporal features into the time-variant

missing patterns can depend on group attributes (e.g. gender or race). Simply
applying off-the-shelf fair learning algorithms to an imputed dataset may lead
to an unfair model. In this paper, we first theoretically analyze different
sources of discrimination risks when training with an imputed dataset. Then, we
propose an integrated approach based on decision trees that does not require a
separate process of imputation and learning. Instead, we train a tree with
missing incorporated as attribute (MIA), which does not require explicit

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In this work, we analyze an efficient sampling-based algorithm for
general-purpose reachability analysis, which remains a notoriously challenging
problem with applications ranging from neural network verification to safety
analysis of dynamical systems. By sampling inputs, evaluating their images in
the true reachable set, and taking their $\epsilon$-padded convex hull as a set
estimator, this algorithm applies to general problem settings and is simple to
implement. Our main contribution is the derivation of asymptotic and
finite-sample accuracy guarantees using random set theory. This analysis
informs algorithmic design to obtain an $\epsilon$-close reachable set
approximation with high probability, provides insights into which reachability
problems are most challenging, and motivates safety-critical applications of
the technique. On a neural network verification task, we show that this
approach is more accurate and significantly faster than prior work. Informed by
our analysis, we also design a robust model predictive controller that we
demonstrate in hardware experiments.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In black-box optimization problems, we aim to maximize an unknown objective
function, where the function is only accessible through feedbacks of an
evaluation or simulation oracle. In real-life, the feedbacks of such oracles
are often noisy and available after some unknown delay that may depend on the
computation time of the oracle. Additionally, if the exact evaluations are
expensive but coarse approximations are available at a lower cost, the
feedbacks can have multi-fidelity. In order to address this problem, we propose
a generic extension of hierarchical optimistic tree search (HOO), called
ProCrastinated Tree Search (PCTS), that flexibly accommodates a delay and
noise-tolerant bandit algorithm. We provide a generic proof technique to
quantify regret of PCTS under delayed, noisy, and multi-fidelity feedbacks.
Specifically, we derive regret bounds of PCTS enabled with delayed-UCB1 (DUCB1)
and delayed-UCB-V (DUCBV) algorithms. Given a horizon $T$, PCTS retains the
regret bound of non-delayed HOO for expected delay of $O(\log T)$ and worsens
by $O(T^{\frac{1-\alpha}{d+2}})$ for expected delays of $O(T^{1-\alpha})$ for
$\alpha \in (0,1]$. We experimentally validate on multiple synthetic functions
and hyperparameter tuning problems that PCTS outperforms the state-of-the-art
black-box optimization methods for feedbacks with different noise levels,
delays, and fidelity.]]></summary>

recognition" (PETRAW) challenge whose objective was to develop surgical
workflow recognition methods based on one or several modalities, among video,
kinematic, and segmentation data, in order to study their added value. The
PETRAW challenge provided a data set of 150 peg transfer sequences performed on
a virtual simulator. This data set was composed of videos, kinematics, semantic
segmentation, and workflow annotations which described the sequences at three
different granularity levels: phase, step, and activity. Five tasks were
proposed to the participants: three of them were related to the recognition of
all granularities with one of the available modalities, while the others
addressed the recognition with a combination of modalities. Average
application-dependent balanced accuracy (AD-Accuracy) was used as evaluation
metric to take unbalanced classes into account and because it is more
clinically relevant than a frame-by-frame score. Seven teams participated in at
least one task and four of them in all tasks. Best results are obtained with
the use of the video and the kinematics data with an AD-Accuracy between 93%
and 90% for the four teams who participated in all tasks. The improvement
between video/kinematic-based methods and the uni-modality ones was significant
for all of the teams. However, the difference in testing execution time between
the video/kinematic-based and the kinematic-based methods has to be taken into
consideration. Is it relevant to spend 20 to 200 times more computing time for
less than 3% of improvement? The PETRAW data set is publicly available at
www.synapse.org/PETRAW to encourage further research in surgical workflow
recognition.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Gaussian Process Convolution Model (GPCM; Tobar et al., 2015a) is a model
for signals with complex spectral structure. A significant limitation of the
GPCM is that it assumes a rapidly decaying spectrum: it can only model smooth
signals. Moreover, inference in the GPCM currently requires (1) a mean-field
assumption, resulting in poorly calibrated uncertainties, and (2) a tedious
variational optimisation of large covariance matrices. We redesign the GPCM
model to induce a richer distribution over the spectrum with relaxed
assumptions about smoothness: the Causal Gaussian Process Convolution Model
(CGPCM) introduces a causality assumption into the GPCM, and the Rough Gaussian
Process Convolution Model (RGPCM) can be interpreted as a Bayesian
nonparametric generalisation of the fractional Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process. We
also propose a more effective variational inference scheme, going beyond the
mean-field assumption: we design a Gibbs sampler which directly samples from
the optimal variational solution, circumventing any variational optimisation
entirely. The proposed variations of the GPCM are validated in experiments on
synthetic and real-world data, showing promising results.]]></summary>

separate signal and noise through a series of transformations which remove
frequencies where noise is present. However, this technique relies on a priori
knowledge of what frequencies contain signal and noise and that these
frequencies do not overlap, which is difficult to achieve in practice. To
address these issues, we introduce a PO-neural network hybrid model, the Pseudo
Projection Operator (PPO), which leverages a neural network to perform
frequency selection. We compare the filtering capabilities of a PPO, PO, and
denoising autoencoder (DAE) on the University of Rochester Multi-Modal Music

experiments, the PPO outperforms both the PO and DAE. Based upon these results,

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Given the computational cost and technical expertise required to train
machine learning models, users may delegate the task of learning to a service
provider. We show how a malicious learner can plant an undetectable backdoor
into a classifier. On the surface, such a backdoored classifier behaves
normally, but in reality, the learner maintains a mechanism for changing the
classification of any input, with only a slight perturbation. Importantly,
without the appropriate "backdoor key", the mechanism is hidden and cannot be
detected by any computationally-bounded observer. We demonstrate two frameworks
for planting undetectable backdoors, with incomparable guarantees.

First, we show how to plant a backdoor in any model, using digital signature
schemes. The construction guarantees that given black-box access to the
original model and the backdoored version, it is computationally infeasible to
find even a single input where they differ. This property implies that the
backdoored model has generalization error comparable with the original model.
Second, we demonstrate how to insert undetectable backdoors in models trained
using the Random Fourier Features (RFF) learning paradigm or in Random ReLU
networks. In this construction, undetectability holds against powerful
white-box distinguishers: given a complete description of the network and the
training data, no efficient distinguisher can guess whether the model is
"clean" or contains a backdoor.

Our construction of undetectable backdoors also sheds light on the related
issue of robustness to adversarial examples. In particular, our construction
can produce a classifier that is indistinguishable from an "adversarially
robust" classifier, but where every input has an adversarial example! In
summary, the existence of undetectable backdoors represent a significant
theoretical roadblock to certifying adversarial robustness.]]></summary>

for attention to be paid to fairness measures as well. Through the analysis of
more than a dozen pretrained language models of varying sizes on two toxic text
classification tasks (English), we demonstrate that focusing on accuracy
measures alone can lead to models with wide variation in fairness
characteristics. Specifically, we observe that fairness can vary even more than
accuracy with increasing training data size and different random
initializations. At the same time, we find that little of the fairness
variation is explained by model size, despite claims in the literature. To
improve model fairness without retraining, we show that two post-processing

retrieval (IR) tasks with good results. There are two major types of dual
encoders, Siamese Dual Encoders (SDE), with parameters shared across two
encoders, and Asymmetric Dual Encoder (ADE), with two distinctly parameterized
encoders. In this work, we explore the dual encoder architectures for QA
retrieval tasks. By evaluating on MS MARCO and the MultiReQA benchmark, we show
that SDE performs significantly better than ADE. We further propose three
different improved versions of ADEs. Based on the evaluation of QA retrieval

Facial-expression: We train a CNN model to measure whether a face has an
acceptable facial expression for being in a video thumbnail. This model is
trained to distinguish faces extracted from artworks/thumbnails, from faces
extracted from random frames of videos. Prominence and interactions:
Character(s) in the thumbnail should be important character(s) in the video, to
prevent the algorithm from suggesting non-representative frames as candidates.
We use face clustering to identify the characters in the video, and form a
graph in which the prominence (frequency of appearance) of the character(s),
and their interactions (co-occurrence) are captured. We use this graph to infer
the relevance of the characters present in each candidate frame. Once every
face is scored based on the two criteria above, we infer frame level scores by
combining the scores for all the faces within a frame.]]></summary>

well-generalized model. However, it induces large memory and inference costs,
which are often not affordable for real-world deployment. Existing work has
resorted to sharing weights among models. However, when increasing the
proportion of the shared weights, the resulting models tend to be similar, and
the benefits of using model ensemble diminish. To retain ensemble benefits
while maintaining a low memory cost, we propose a consistency-regularized
ensemble learning approach based on perturbed models, named CAMERO.
Specifically, we share the weights of bottom layers across all models and apply
different perturbations to the hidden representations for different models,
which can effectively promote the model diversity. Meanwhile, we apply a
prediction consistency regularizer across the perturbed models to control the
variance due to the model diversity. Our experiments using large language
models demonstrate that CAMERO significantly improves the generalization
performance of the ensemble model. Specifically, CAMERO outperforms the
standard ensemble of 8 BERT-base models on the GLUE benchmark by 0.7 with a
significantly smaller model size (114.2M vs. 880.6M).]]></summary>

information matrix at the true parameter is degenerate, the fixed step-size
gradient descent algorithm takes polynomial number of steps in terms of the
sample size $n$ to converge to a final statistical radius around the true
parameter, which can be unsatisfactory for the application. To further improve
that computational complexity, we consider the utilization of the second-order
information in the design of optimization algorithms. Specifically, we study
the normalized gradient descent (NormGD) algorithm for solving parameter
estimation in parametric statistical models, which is a variant of gradient
descent algorithm whose step size is scaled by the maximum eigenvalue of the
Hessian matrix of the empirical loss function of statistical models. When the
population loss function, i.e., the limit of the empirical loss function when
$n$ goes to infinity, is homogeneous in all directions, we demonstrate that the
NormGD iterates reach a final statistical radius around the true parameter
after a logarithmic number of iterations in terms of $n$. Therefore, for fixed
dimension $d$, the NormGD algorithm achieves the optimal overall computational
complexity $\mathcal{O}(n)$ to reach the final statistical radius. This
computational complexity is cheaper than that of the fixed step-size gradient
descent algorithm, which is of the order $\mathcal{O}(n^{\tau})$ for some $\tau
> 1$, to reach the same statistical radius. We illustrate our general theory
under two statistical models: generalized linear models and mixture models, and
experimental results support our prediction with general theory.]]></summary>

approximate solutions for the ridge regression problem $\min_x \|{Ax-b}\|_2^2
+\lambda\|{x}\|_2^2$ where $A \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times d}$ with $d \ge n$. Our
algorithm, for a constant number of iterations (requiring a constant number of
passes over the input), improves upon earlier work of Chowdhury et al., by
requiring that the sketching matrix only has a weaker Approximate Matrix
Multiplication (AMM) guarantee that depends on $\epsilon$, along with a
constant subspace embedding guarantee. The earlier work instead requires that
the sketching matrix have a subspace embedding guarantee that depends on
$\epsilon$. For example, to produce a $1+\varepsilon$ approximate solution in
$1$ iteration, which requires $2$ passes over the input, our algorithm requires
the OSNAP embedding to have $m= O(n\sigma^2/\lambda\varepsilon)$ rows with a
sparsity parameter $s = O(\log(n))$, whereas the earlier algorithm of Chowdhury
et al., with the same number of rows of OSNAP requires a sparsity $s =
O(\sqrt{\sigma^2/\lambda\varepsilon} \cdot \log(n))$, where $\sigma =
\|{A}\|_2$ is the spectral norm of the matrix $A$. We also show that this
algorithm can be used to give faster algorithms for kernel ridge regression.
Finally, we show that the sketch size required for our algorithm is essentially
optimal for a natural framework of algorithms for ridge regression by proving
lower bounds on oblivious sketching matrices for AMM. The sketch size lower

come in a variety of sizes. As high-resolution details are downsampled away,
and low-resolution images are discarded altogether, precious supervision is
lost. We argue that every pixel matters and create datasets with variable-size
images, collected at their native resolutions. Taking advantage of this data is
challenging; high-resolution processing is costly, and current architectures
can only process fixed-resolution data. We introduce continuous-scale training,
a process that samples patches at random scales to train a new generator with
variable output resolutions. First, conditioning the generator on a target
scale allows us to generate higher resolutions images than previously possible,
without adding layers to the model. Second, by conditioning on continuous
coordinates, we can sample patches that still obey a consistent global layout,
which also allows for scalable training at higher resolutions. Controlled FFHQ
experiments show our method takes advantage of the multi-resolution training
data better than discrete multi-scale approaches, achieving better FID scores
and cleaner high-frequency details. We also train on other natural image
domains including churches, mountains, and birds, and demonstrate arbitrary

presents a neonatal bowel sound detection method to assist the auscultation.
Specifically, a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is proposed to classify
peristalsis and non-peristalsis sounds. The classification is then optimized
using a Laplace Hidden Semi-Markov Model (HSMM). The proposed method is
validated on abdominal sounds from 49 newborn infants admitted to our tertiary

effectively detect bowel sounds with accuracy and area under curve (AUC) score
being 89.81% and 83.96% respectively, outperforming 13 baseline methods.
Furthermore, the proposed Laplace HSMM refinement strategy is proven capable to
enhance other bowel sound detection models. The outcomes of this work have the

neural networks on embedded and mobile devices. Hence, both accuracy and
efficiency are of critical importance. To explore a balance between them, a
knowledge distillation strategy is proposed for general visual representation
learning. It utilizes our well-designed activation map adaptive module to
replace some blocks of the teacher network, exploring the most appropriate
supervisory features adaptively during the training process. Using the
teacher's hidden layer output to prompt the student network to train so as to
transfer effective semantic information.To verify the effectiveness of our
strategy, this paper applied our method to cifar-10 dataset. Results
demonstrate that the method can boost the accuracy of the student network by

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In machine learning, disparity metrics are often defined by measuring the
difference in the performance or outcome of a model, across different
sub-populations (groups) of datapoints. Thus, the inputs to disparity
quantification consist of a model's predictions $\hat{y}$, the ground-truth
labels for the predictions $y$, and group labels $g$ for the data points.
Performance of the model for each group is calculated by comparing $\hat{y}$
and $y$ for the datapoints within a specific group, and as a result, disparity
of performance across the different groups can be calculated. In many real
world scenarios however, group labels ($g$) may not be available at scale
during training and validation time, or collecting them might not be feasible
or desirable as they could often be sensitive information. As a result,
evaluating disparity metrics across categorical groups would not be feasible.
On the other hand, in many scenarios noisy groupings may be obtainable using
some form of a proxy, which would allow measuring disparity metrics across
sub-populations. Here we explore performing such analysis on computer vision
models trained on human faces, and on tasks such as face attribute prediction
and affect estimation. Our experiments indicate that embeddings resulting from
an off-the-shelf face recognition model, could meaningfully serve as a proxy
for such estimation.]]></summary>

combines gradient-matching and several regularization terms developed using key

increasingly popular method for customizing robot behavior. However, in recent
years, there has been a growing body of anecdotal evidence that learning reward
functions from preferences is prone to spurious correlations and reward gaming
or hacking behaviors. While there is much anecdotal, empirical, and theoretical
analysis of causal confusion and reward gaming behaviors both in reinforcement
learning and imitation learning approaches that directly map from states to
actions, we provide the first systematic study of causal confusion in the
context of learning reward functions from preferences. To facilitate this
study, we identify a set of three preference learning benchmark domains where
we observe causal confusion when learning from offline datasets of pairwise
trajectory preferences: a simple reacher domain, an assistive feeding domain,
and an itch-scratching domain. To gain insight into this observed causal
confusion, we present a sensitivity analysis that explores the effect of
different factors--including the type of training data, reward model capacity,
and feature dimensionality--on the robustness of rewards learned from
preferences. We find evidence that learning rewards from pairwise trajectory
preferences is highly sensitive and non-robust to spurious features and
increasing model capacity, but not as sensitive to the type of training data.

decisions for individuals based on a sensitive attribute (e.g., age, sex). In
domains where prediction accuracy is paramount, it could potentially be
acceptable to fit a model which exhibits disparate treatment. To evaluate the
effect of disparate treatment, we compare the performance of split classifiers
(i.e., classifiers trained and deployed separately on each group) with
group-blind classifiers (i.e., classifiers which do not use a sensitive
attribute). We introduce the benefit-of-splitting for quantifying the
performance improvement by splitting classifiers. Computing the
benefit-of-splitting directly from its definition could be intractable since it
involves solving optimization problems over an infinite-dimensional functional
space. Under different performance measures, we (i) prove an equivalent
expression for the benefit-of-splitting which can be efficiently computed by
solving small-scale convex programs; (ii) provide sharp upper and lower bounds
for the benefit-of-splitting which reveal precise conditions where a
group-blind classifier will always suffer from a non-trivial performance gap
from the split classifiers. In the finite sample regime, splitting is not
necessarily beneficial and we provide data-dependent bounds to understand this
effect. Finally, we validate our theoretical results through numerical
experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We consider the problem of quantum state certification, where we are given
the description of a mixed state $\sigma \in \mathbb{C}^{d \times d}$, $n$
copies of a mixed state $\rho \in \mathbb{C}^{d \times d}$, and $\varepsilon >
0$, and we are asked to determine whether $\rho = \sigma$ or whether $\| \rho -
\sigma \|_1 > \varepsilon$. When $\sigma$ is the maximally mixed state
$\frac{1}{d} I_d$, this is known as mixedness testing. We focus on algorithms
which use incoherent measurements, i.e. which only measure one copy of $\rho$
at a time. Unlike those that use entangled, multi-copy measurements, these can
be implemented without persistent quantum memory and thus represent a large
class of protocols that can be run on current or near-term devices.

For mixedness testing, there is a folklore algorithm which uses incoherent
measurements and only needs $O(d^{3/2} / \varepsilon^2)$ copies. The algorithm
is non-adaptive, that is, its measurements are fixed ahead of time, and is
known to be optimal for non-adaptive algorithms. However, when the algorithm
can make arbitrary incoherent measurements, the best known lower bound is only
$\Omega (d^{4/3} / \varepsilon^2)$ [Bubeck-Chen-Li '20], and it has been an
outstanding open problem to close this polynomial gap. In this work, 1) we
settle the copy complexity of mixedness testing with incoherent measurements
and show that $\Omega (d^{3/2} / \varepsilon^2)$ copies are necessary, and 2)
we show the instance-optimal bounds for state certification to general $\sigma$
first derived by [Chen-Li-O'Donnell '21] for non-adaptive measurements also
hold for arbitrary incoherent measurements.

Qualitatively, our results say that adaptivity does not help at all for these
problems. Our results are based on new techniques that allow us to reduce the
problem to understanding certain matrix martingales, which we believe may be of
independent interest.]]></summary>

partial observation of the true states of the world is critical for
understanding a wide range of scenarios. Yet, previous modeling work on agent
learning and decision-making either lacks a systematic way to describe this
source of uncertainty or puts the focus on obtaining optimal policies using
complex models of the world that would impose an unrealistically high cognitive
demand on real agents. In this work we aim to efficiently describe the emergent
behavior of biologically plausible and parsimonious learning agents faced with
partially observable worlds. Therefore we derive and present deterministic
reinforcement learning dynamics where the agents observe the true state of the
environment only partially. We showcase the broad applicability of our dynamics
across different classes of partially observable agent-environment systems. We
find that partial observability creates unintuitive benefits in a number of
specific contexts, pointing the way to further research on a general
understanding of such effects. For instance, partially observant agents can
learn better outcomes faster, in a more stable way and even overcome social
dilemmas. Furthermore, our method allows the application of dynamical systems
theory to partially observable multiagent leaning. In this regard we find the
emergence of catastrophic limit cycles, a critical slowing down of the learning
processes between reward regimes and the separation of the learning dynamics
into fast and slow directions, all caused by partial observability. Therefore,
the presented dynamics have the potential to become a formal, yet practical,
lightweight and robust tool for researchers in biology, social science and
machine learning to systematically investigate the effects of interacting
partially observant agents.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Measures to predict 30-day readmission are considered an important quality
factor for hospitals as accurate predictions can reduce the overall cost of
care by identifying high risk patients before they are discharged. While recent
deep learning-based studies have shown promising empirical results on
readmission prediction, several limitations exist that may hinder widespread
clinical utility, such as (a) only patients with certain conditions are
considered, (b) existing approaches do not leverage data temporality, (c)
individual admissions are assumed independent of each other, which is
unrealistic, (d) prior studies are usually limited to single source of data and
single center data. To address these limitations, we propose a multimodal,
modality-agnostic spatiotemporal graph neural network (MM-STGNN) for prediction
of 30-day all-cause hospital readmission that fuses multimodal in-patient
longitudinal data. By training and evaluating our methods using longitudinal
chest radiographs and electronic health records from two independent centers,
we demonstrate that MM-STGNN achieves AUROC of 0.79 on both primary and
external datasets. Furthermore, MM-STGNN significantly outperforms the current
clinical reference standard, LACE+ score (AUROC=0.61), on the primary dataset.
For subset populations of patients with heart and vascular disease, our model
also outperforms baselines on predicting 30-day readmission (e.g., 3.7 point
improvement in AUROC in patients with heart disease). Lastly, qualitative model
interpretability analysis indicates that while patients' primary diagnoses were
not explicitly used to train the model, node features crucial for model
prediction directly reflect patients' primary diagnoses. Importantly, our
MM-STGNN is agnostic to node feature modalities and could be utilized to
integrate multimodal data for triaging patients in various downstream resource
allocation tasks.]]></summary>

forecasting algorithm also known as EvoSTS. The algorithm attempts to
evolutionary prioritize weights of Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Network that
best minimize the reconstruction loss of a predicted signal using a learned

set number of children with the same initial weights are spawned. Each child
undergoes a training step and adjusts their weights on the same data. Due to
stochastic back-propagation, the set of children has a variety of weights with
different levels of performance. The weights that best minimize the
reconstruction loss with a given signal dictionary are passed to the next
generation. The predictions from the best-performing weights of the first and
last generation are compared. We found improvements while comparing the weights
of these two generations. However, due to several confounding parameters and
hyperparameter limitations, some of the weights had negligible improvements. To
the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to use sparse coding in

imaging from screening exams cause unnecessary procedures, patient anxiety, and

trained the algorithm to determine the absence of cancer using 123,248 2D
digital mammograms (6,161 cancers) and performed a retrospective study on
14,831 screening exams (1,026 cancers) from 15 US and 3 UK sites. Retrospective
evaluation of the algorithm on the largest of the US sites (11,592 mammograms,
101 cancers) a) left the cancer detection rate unaffected (p=0.02,
non-inferiority margin 0.25 cancers per 1000 exams), b) reduced callbacks for
diagnostic exams by 31.1% compared to standard clinical readings, c) reduced
benign needle biopsies by 7.4%, and d) reduced screening exams requiring
radiologist interpretation by 41.6% in the simulated clinical workflow. This
work lays the foundation for semi-autonomous breast cancer screening systems

functional approximation and prediction. While the representation properties of
DL have been well studied, uncertainty quantification remains challenging and
largely unexplored. Data augmentation techniques are a natural approach to
provide uncertainty quantification and to incorporate stochastic Monte Carlo
search into stochastic gradient descent (SGD) methods. The purpose of our paper
is to show that training DL architectures with data augmentation leads to
efficiency gains. We use the theory of scale mixtures of normals to derive data
augmentation strategies for deep learning. This allows variants of the
expectation-maximization and MCMC algorithms to be brought to bear on these
high dimensional nonlinear deep learning models. To demonstrate our
methodology, we develop data augmentation algorithms for a variety of commonly
used activation functions: logit, ReLU, leaky ReLU and SVM. Our methodology is
compared to traditional stochastic gradient descent with back-propagation. Our
optimization procedure leads to a version of iteratively re-weighted least
squares and can be implemented at scale with accelerated linear algebra methods
providing substantial improvement in speed. We illustrate our methodology on a
number of standard datasets. Finally, we conclude with directions for future

4th Industrial Revolution. ICS devices like Programmable Logic Controllers
(PLCs), automate, monitor, and control critical processes in industrial,

Technology (OT) with Information Technology (IT) has opened a new and unique
threat landscape. This has inspired defense research that focuses heavily on
Machine Learning (ML) based anomaly detection methods that run on external IT
hardware, which means an increase in costs and the further expansion of the
threat landscape. To remove this requirement, we introduce the ICS machine
learning inference framework (ICSML) which enables the execution of ML model
inference natively on the PLC. ICSML is implemented in IEC 61131-3 code and
provides several optimizations to bypass the limitations imposed by the
domain-specific languages. Therefore, it works \emph{on every PLC without the
need for vendor support}. ICSML provides a complete set of components for the
creation of full ML models similarly to established ML frameworks. We run a
series of benchmarks studying memory and performance and compare our solution
to the TFLite inference framework. At the same time, we develop domain-specific

paper, we investigate the design of measurement-based admission control

which slice. The objective is to devise a joint measurement and decision

of measurements made before committing to the decision). We study the design of
such strategies for several natural admission criteria specifying what a
correct decision is. For each of these criteria, using tools from best arm
identification in bandits, we first derive an explicit information-theoretical
lower bound on the cost of any algorithm returning the correct decision with
fixed confidence. We then devise a joint measurement and decision strategy
achieving this theoretical limit. We compare empirically the measurement costs
of these strategies, and compare them both to the lower bounds as well as a

functional to be minimized in the training phase. Sequential data are
ubiquitous across many fields of research, and are often treated with Euclidean
distance-based loss functions that were designed for tabular data. For smooth
oscillatory data, those conventional approaches lack the ability to penalize
amplitude, frequency and phase prediction errors at the same time, and tend to
be biased towards amplitude errors. We introduce the surface similarity
parameter (SSP) as a novel loss function that is especially useful for training
machine learning models on smooth oscillatory sequences. Our extensive
experiments on chaotic spatio-temporal dynamical systems indicate that the SSP
is beneficial for shaping gradients, thereby accelerating the training process,
reducing the final prediction error, and implementing a stronger regularization
effect compared to using classical loss functions. The results indicate the
potential of the novel loss metric particularly for highly complex and chaotic
data, such as data stemming from the nonlinear two-dimensional
Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation and the linear propagation of dispersive surface
gravity waves in fluids.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Federated learning (FL) is a distributed machine learning paradigm in which
the server periodically aggregates local model parameters from clients without
assembling their private data. User-constrained communication bandwidth and the
requirement for personalized models pose severe challenges to FL. Federated
distillation (FD) is proposed to simultaneously address the two problems, which
exchanges knowledge between the server and clients, supporting heterogeneous
local models while significantly reducing communication overhead. However, most
existing FD methods require a proxy dataset, which is often unavailable.
Proxy-data-free FD approaches eliminate the need for additional public data
beyond clients' private data, but suffer from remarkable discrepancy among
local knowledge due to model heterogeneity, leading to ambiguous representation
on the server and inevitable accuracy degradation. To tackle this issue, we
propose a proxy-data-free FD algorithm based on distributed knowledge
congruence (FedDKC). FedDKC leverages well-designed refinement strategies to
narrow local knowledge differences into an acceptable upper bound to mitigate
the negative effects of knowledge incongruence. Specifically, from perspectives
of peak probability and Shannon entropy of local knowledge, we design
kernel-based knowledge refinement (KKR) and searching-based knowledge
refinement (SKR) respectively, and theoretically guarantee the refined-local
knowledge can satisfy an approximately-similar distribution and be regarded as
congruent. Extensive experiments conducted on three common datasets demonstrate
that our proposed FedDKC method outperforms the state-of-the-art in 93.33% of
comparisons, and achieves faster convergence without increasing communication
overhead.]]></summary>

Machine Learning (ML) models for clinical decision support. The study revealed
a more nuanced role for ML explanation models, when these are pragmatically
embedded in the clinical context. Despite the general positive attitude of
healthcare professionals (HCPs) towards explanations as a safety and trust
mechanism, for a significant set of participants there were negative effects
associated with confirmation bias, accentuating model over-reliance and
increased effort to interact with the model. Also, contradicting one of its
main intended functions, standard explanatory models showed limited ability to
support a critical understanding of the limitations of the model. However, we
found new significant positive effects which repositions the role of
explanations within a clinical context: these include reduction of automation
bias, addressing ambiguous clinical cases (cases where HCPs were not certain
about their decision) and support of less experienced HCPs in the acquisition
of new domain knowledge.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We present Visuelle 2.0, the first dataset useful for facing diverse
prediction problems that a fast-fashion company has to manage routinely.
Furthermore, we demonstrate how the use of computer vision is substantial in
this scenario. Visuelle 2.0 contains data for 6 seasons / 5355 clothing
products of Nuna Lie, a famous Italian company with hundreds of shops located
in different areas within the country. In particular, we focus on a specific
prediction problem, namely short-observation new product sale forecasting
(SO-fore). SO-fore assumes that the season has started and a set of new
products is on the shelves of the different stores. The goal is to forecast the
sales for a particular horizon, given a short, available past (few weeks),
since no earlier statistics are available. To be successful, SO-fore approaches
should capture this short past and exploit other modalities or exogenous data.
To these aims, Visuelle 2.0 is equipped with disaggregated data at the
item-shop level and multi-modal information for each clothing item, allowing
computer vision approaches to come into play. The main message that we deliver
is that the use of image data with deep networks boosts performances obtained
when using the time series in long-term forecasting scenarios, ameliorating the
WAPE by 8.2% and the MAE by 7.7%. The dataset is available at:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Despite being studied extensively for a few decades, handwritten character
recognition (HCR) is considered a challenging learning problem in pattern
recognition and there is very limited research on script independent models.
This is mainly because of diversity of scripts, focus of the conventional
research on handcrafted feature extraction techniques, and unavailability of
public datasets and codes to reproduce the results. On the other hand, deep
learning has witnessed huge success in different areas of pattern recognition,
including HCR, and provides end-to-end learning but it has been studied for
specific scripts only. In this paper, we have proposed a novel deep learning
architecture which exploits transfer learning and image-augmentation for
end-to-end learning for script independent handwritten character recognition,
called HCR-Net. HCR-Net is based on a novel transfer learning approach for HCR,
where some of lower layers of a pre-trained network are utilized. Due to
transfer learning and image-augmentation, HCR-Net provides faster training,
better performance and better generalizations, and can achieve up to 99\%
results of its final accuracy in just first epoch. The experimental results on
publicly available datasets of Bangla, Punjabi, Hindi, English, Swedish, Urdu,
Farsi, Tibetan, Kannada, Malayalam, Telugu, Marathi, Nepali and Arabic
languages prove the efficacy of HCR-Net and establishes several new benchmarks.
For reproducibility of the results and for the advancements of the HCR
research, complete code is publicly released at

that models this setting as a two-sided matching market with bandit learners. A
recent result in this area states that it is impossible to simultaneously
guarantee two natural desiderata: stability and low optimal regret for all
agents. Resource-allocating platforms can point to this result as a
justification for assigning good long-term outcomes to some agents and poor
ones to others. We show that this impossibility need not hold true. In

costs and transfers -- we prove that it is possible to simultaneously guarantee
four desiderata: stability, low optimal regret, fairness in the distribution of

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Recent work has shown that deep reinforcement learning (DRL) policies are
vulnerable to adversarial perturbations. Adversaries can mislead policies of
DRL agents by perturbing the state of the environment observed by the agents.
Existing attacks are feasible in principle but face challenges in practice,
either by being too slow to fool DRL policies in real time or by modifying past
observations stored in the agent's memory. We show that using the Universal
Adversarial Perturbation (UAP) method to compute perturbations, independent of
the individual inputs to which they are applied to, can fool DRL policies
effectively and in real time. We describe three such attack variants. Via an
extensive evaluation using three Atari 2600 games, we show that our attacks are
effective, as they fully degrade the performance of three different DRL agents
(up to 100%, even when the $l_\infty$ bound on the perturbation is as small as
0.01). It is faster compared to the response time (0.6ms on average) of
different DRL policies, and considerably faster than prior attacks using
adversarial perturbations (1.8ms on average). We also show that our attack
technique is efficient, incurring an online computational cost of 0.027ms on
average. Using two further tasks involving robotic movement, we confirm that
our results generalize to more complex DRL tasks. Furthermore, we demonstrate
that the effectiveness of known defenses diminishes against universal
perturbations. We propose an effective technique that detects all known
adversarial perturbations against DRL policies, including all the universal
perturbations presented in this paper.]]></summary>

RNN model is trained for additional epochs after perfectly learning its target

that it is sparsely activated guided by predefined skills. Different from
traditional dense models that always activate all the model parameters,
SkillNet only activates parts of the model parameters whose skills are relevant
to the target task. When learning for a new task, our approach precisely
activates required skills and also provides an option to add new skills. We
evaluate on natural language understandings tasks and have the following
findings. First, with only one model checkpoint, SkillNet performs better than
task-specific fine-tuning and two multi-task learning baselines (i.e., dense

pre-training further improves the overall performance. Third, SkillNet

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Graph neural networks (GNN) are very popular methods in machine learning and
have been applied very successfully to the prediction of the properties of
molecules and materials. First-order GNNs are well known to be incomplete,
i.e., there exist graphs that are distinct but appear identical when seen
through the lens of the GNN. More complicated schemes have thus been designed
to increase their resolving power. Applications to molecules (and more
generally, point clouds), however, add a geometric dimension to the problem.
The most straightforward and prevalent approach to construct graph
representation for molecules regards atoms as vertices in a graph and draws a
bond between each pair of atoms within a chosen cutoff. Bonds can be decorated
with the distance between atoms, and the resulting "distance graph NNs" (dGNN)
have empirically demonstrated excellent resolving power and are widely used in
chemical ML, with all known indistinguishable graphs being resolved in the
fully-connected limit. Here we show that even for the restricted case of
fully-connected graphs induced by 3D atom clouds dGNNs are not complete. We
construct pairs of distinct point clouds that generate graphs that, for any
cutoff radius, are equivalent based on a first-order Weisfeiler-Lehman test.
This class of degenerate structures includes chemically-plausible
configurations, setting an ultimate limit to the expressive power of some of
the well-established GNN architectures for atomistic machine learning. Models
that explicitly use angular or directional information in the description of
atomic environments can resolve these degeneracies.]]></summary>

shared as well as conflicting interests between Deep Metric Learning and
continual learning, thus demonstrating pros and cons of learning discriminative
representations in continual learning. Based on these findings, we propose a
simple method -- Semi-Discriminative Representation Loss (SDRL) -- for
continual learning. In comparison with state-of-the-art methods, SDRL shows
better performance with low computational cost on multiple benchmark tasks in
the setting of online continual learning.]]></summary>

polymeric flows is the availability of reliable and interpretable hydrodynamic
models that faithfully encode the underlying micro-scale polymer dynamics. The
main complication arises from the long polymer relaxation time, the complex
molecular structure and heterogeneous interaction. DeePN$^2$, a deep
learning-based non-Newtonian hydrodynamic model, has been proposed and has
shown some success in systematically passing the micro-scale structural
mechanics information to the macro-scale hydrodynamics for suspensions with
simple polymer conformation and bond potential. The model retains a
multi-scaled nature by mapping the polymer configurations into a set of
symmetry-preserving macro-scale features. The extended constitutive laws for
these macro-scale features can be directly learned from the kinetics of their
micro-scale counterparts. In this paper, we develop DeePN$^2$ using more
complex micro-structural models. We show that DeePN$^2$ can faithfully capture
the broadly overlooked viscoelastic differences arising from the specific
molecular structural mechanics without human intervention.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It is known that when the statistical models are singular, i.e., the Fisher
information matrix at the true parameter is degenerate, the fixed step-size
gradient descent algorithm takes polynomial number of steps in terms of the
sample size $n$ to converge to a final statistical radius around the true
parameter, which can be unsatisfactory for the application. To further improve
that computational complexity, we consider the utilization of the second-order
information in the design of optimization algorithms. Specifically, we study
the normalized gradient descent (NormGD) algorithm for solving parameter
estimation in parametric statistical models, which is a variant of gradient
descent algorithm whose step size is scaled by the maximum eigenvalue of the
Hessian matrix of the empirical loss function of statistical models. When the
population loss function, i.e., the limit of the empirical loss function when
$n$ goes to infinity, is homogeneous in all directions, we demonstrate that the
NormGD iterates reach a final statistical radius around the true parameter
after a logarithmic number of iterations in terms of $n$. Therefore, for fixed
dimension $d$, the NormGD algorithm achieves the optimal overall computational
complexity $\mathcal{O}(n)$ to reach the final statistical radius. This
computational complexity is cheaper than that of the fixed step-size gradient
descent algorithm, which is of the order $\mathcal{O}(n^{\tau})$ for some $\tau
> 1$, to reach the same statistical radius. We illustrate our general theory
under two statistical models: generalized linear models and mixture models, and
experimental results support our prediction with general theory.]]></summary>

learning. Due to the non-stationary nature of the data where the underlying
distribution changes over time (concept drift), the model needs to continuously
adapt to new data statistics. Stream-based Active Learning (AL) approaches
address this problem by interactively querying a human expert to provide new
data labels for the most recent samples, within a limited budget. Existing AL
strategies assume that labels are immediately available, while in a real-world
scenario the expert requires time to provide a queried label (verification
latency), and by the time the requested labels arrive they may not be relevant
anymore. In this article, we investigate the influence of finite,
time-variable, and unknown verification delay, in the presence of concept drift
on AL approaches. We propose PRopagate (PR), a latency independent utility
estimator which also predicts the requested, but not yet known, labels.
Furthermore, we propose a drift-dependent dynamic budget strategy, which uses a
variable distribution of the labelling budget over time, after a detected
drift. Thorough experimental evaluation, with both synthetic and real-world
non-stationary datasets, and different settings of verification latency and
budget are conducted and analyzed. We empirically show that the proposed method
consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art. Additionally, we demonstrate
that with variable budget allocation in time, it is possible to boost the
performance of AL strategies, without increasing the overall labeling budget.]]></summary>

treatment of diseases. These problems are solved by highly complex models, such
as deep networks (DN), requiring a large amount of labeled data for training.
Thereby, many DNs possess task- or imaging modality specific architectures with
a decision-making process that is often hard to explain and interpret. Here, we
propose a framework that embeds existing DNs into a low-dimensional subspace
induced by the learnable explicit feature map (LEFM) layer. Compared to the
existing DN, the framework adds one hyperparameter and only modestly increase
the number of learnable parameters. The method is aimed at, but not limited to,
segmentation of low-dimensional medical images, such as color histopathological
images of stained frozen sections. Since features in the LEFM layer are
polynomial functions of the original features, proposed LEFM-Nets contribute to
the interpretability of network decisions. In this work, we combined LEFM with
the known networks: DeepLabv3+, UNet, UNet++ and MA-net. New LEFM-Nets are
applied to the segmentation of adenocarcinoma of a colon in a liver from images
of hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) stained frozen sections. LEFM-Nets are also
tested on nuclei segmentation from images of H&E stained frozen sections of ten
human organs. On the first problem, LEFM-Nets achieved statistically
significant performance improvement in terms of micro balanced accuracy and
$F_1$ score than original networks. LEFM-Nets achieved only better performance
in comparison with the original networks on the second problem. The source code

analysis more accessible, by separating probabilistic modelling from
probabilistic inference. In practice this decoupling is difficult. No single
inference algorithm can be used as a probabilistic programming back-end that is
simultaneously reliable, efficient, black-box, and general. Probabilistic
programming languages often choose a single algorithm to apply to a given
problem, thus inheriting its limitations. While substantial work has been done
both to formalise probabilistic programming and to improve efficiency of
inference, there has been little work that makes use of the available program
structure, by formally analysing it, to better utilise the underlying inference
algorithm.

This dissertation presents three novel techniques (both static and dynamic),
which aim to improve probabilistic programming using program analysis. The
techniques analyse a probabilistic program and adapt it to make inference more
efficient, sometimes in a way that would have been tedious or impossible to do
by hand.]]></summary>

features on the prediction fosters model explainability and delivers relevant

ranking assess input features individually, in this study, we go one step
further and rank the importance of groups of features, denoted as
feature-blocks. A feature-block can contain features of a specific type or
features derived from a particular source, which are presented to the neural
network in separate input branches (multiblock ANNs). This work presents three
methods pursuing distinct strategies to rank features in multiblock ANNs by
their importance: (1) a composite strategy building on individual feature
importance rankings, (2) a knock-in, and (3) a knock-out strategy. While the
composite strategy builds on state-of-the-art feature importance rankings,
knock-in and knock-out strategies evaluate the block as a whole via a mutual
information criterion. Our experiments consist of a simulation study validating
all three approaches, followed by a case study on two distinct real-world
datasets to compare the strategies. We conclude that each strategy has its

parameter-free nonlinear dimensionality reduction technique that provides
solutions to some drawbacks in existing global nonlinear dimensionality
reduction algorithms in imaging applications. Wassmap represents images via
probability measures in Wasserstein space, then uses pairwise quadratic
Wasserstein distances between the associated measures to produce a
low-dimensional, approximately isometric embedding. We show that the algorithm
is able to exactly recover parameters of some image manifolds including those
generated by translations or dilations of a fixed generating measure.
Additionally, we show that a discrete version of the algorithm retrieves
parameters from manifolds generated from discrete measures by providing a
theoretical bridge to transfer recovery results from functional data to
discrete data. Testing of the proposed algorithms on various image data
manifolds show that Wassmap yields good embeddings compared with other global
techniques.]]></summary>

Recent approaches to this problem leverage neural language models, although

area of research as the quality of air is closely related to human health and
well-being. However, traditional statistics and shallow machine learning-based
approaches in anomaly detection in the IAQ area could not detect anomalies
involving the observation of correlations across several data points (i.e.,
often referred to as long-term dependences). We propose a hybrid deep learning
model that combines LSTM with Autoencoder for anomaly detection tasks in IAQ to
address this issue. In our approach, the LSTM network is comprised of multiple
LSTM cells that work with each other to learn the long-term dependences of the
data in a time-series sequence. Autoencoder identifies the optimal threshold
based on the reconstruction loss rates evaluated on every data across all
time-series sequences. Our experimental results, based on the Dunedin CO2
time-series dataset obtained through a real-world deployment of the schools in
New Zealand, demonstrate a very high and robust accuracy rate (99.50%) that

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Although mission-critical applications require the use of deep neural
networks (DNNs), their continuous execution at mobile devices results in a
significant increase in energy consumption. While edge offloading can decrease
energy consumption, erratic patterns in channel quality, network and edge
server load can lead to severe disruption of the system's key operations. An
alternative approach, called split computing, generates compressed
representations within the model (called "bottlenecks"), to reduce bandwidth
usage and energy consumption. Prior work has proposed approaches that introduce
additional layers, to the detriment of energy consumption and latency. For this
reason, we propose a new framework called BottleFit, which, in addition to
targeted DNN architecture modifications, includes a novel training strategy to
achieve high accuracy even with strong compression rates. We apply BottleFit on
cutting-edge DNN models in image classification, and show that BottleFit
achieves 77.1% data compression with up to 0.6% accuracy loss on ImageNet
dataset, while state of the art such as SPINN loses up to 6% in accuracy. We
experimentally measure the power consumption and latency of an image
classification application running on an NVIDIA Jetson Nano board (GPU-based)
and a Raspberry PI board (GPU-less). We show that BottleFit decreases power
consumption and latency respectively by up to 49% and 89% with respect to
(w.r.t.) local computing and by 37% and 55% w.r.t. edge offloading. We also
compare BottleFit with state-of-the-art autoencoders-based approaches, and show
that (i) BottleFit reduces power consumption and execution time respectively by
up to 54% and 44% on the Jetson and 40% and 62% on Raspberry PI; (ii) the size
of the head model executed on the mobile device is 83 times smaller. We publish
the code repository for reproducibility of the results in this study.]]></summary>

applications such as program vulnerability assessment and malware detection.
This involves interpreting instructions executed by software and often
necessitates converting the software's binary file data to assembly language.
The conversion process requires information about the binary file's target
instruction set architecture (ISA). However, ISA information might not be
included in binary files due to compilation errors, partial downloads, or
adversarial corruption of file metadata. Machine learning (ML) is a promising
methodology that can be used to identify the target ISA using binary data in
the object code section of binary files. In this paper we propose a binary code
feature extraction model to improve the accuracy and scalability of ML-based
ISA identification methods. Our feature extraction model can be used in the
absence of domain knowledge about the ISAs. Specifically, we adapt models from
natural language processing (NLP) to i) identify successive byte patterns
commonly observed in binary codes, ii) estimate the significance of each byte
pattern to a binary file, and iii) estimate the relevance of each byte pattern
in distinguishing between ISAs. We introduce character-level features of
encoded binaries to identify fine-grained bit patterns inherent to each ISA. We
use a dataset with binaries from 12 different ISAs to evaluate our approach.
Empirical evaluations show that using our byte-level features in ML-based ISA
identification results in an 8% higher accuracy than the state-of-the-art
features based on byte-histograms and byte pattern signatures. We observe that
character-level features allow reducing the size of the feature set by up to
16x while maintaining accuracy above 97%.]]></summary>

convergence performance. To overcome this limitation, we implement a sign-bit

cascading compression via an elaborate bit-wise operation for unbiased sign
aggregation and its specific global compensation mechanism for mitigating
compression deviation. The proposed framework retains the same theoretical
convergence rate as non-compression mechanisms. Experimental results
demonstrate that Marsit reduces up to 35% training time while preserving the

computers to execute complicated quantum algorithms. Due to its fundamental
importance, a plethora of quantum compilers has been designed in past years.
However, there are several caveats to current protocols, which are low
optimality, high inference time, limited scalability, and lack of universality.
To compensate for these defects, here we devise an efficient and practical
quantum compiler assisted by advanced deep reinforcement learning (RL)
techniques, i.e., data generation, deep Q-learning, and AQ* search. In this
way, our protocol is compatible with various quantum machines and can be used
to compile multi-qubit operators. We systematically evaluate the performance of
our proposal in compiling quantum operators with both inverse-closed and
inverse-free universal basis sets. In the task of single-qubit operator
compiling, our proposal outperforms other RL-based quantum compilers in the
measure of compiling sequence length and inference time. Meanwhile, the output
solution is near-optimal, guaranteed by the Solovay-Kitaev theorem. Notably,
for the inverse-free universal basis set, the achieved sequence length
complexity is comparable with the inverse-based setting and dramatically
advances previous methods. These empirical results contribute to improving the
inverse-free Solovay-Kitaev theorem. In addition, for the first time, we
demonstrate how to leverage RL-based quantum compilers to accomplish two-qubit
operator compiling. The achieved results open an avenue for integrating RL with
quantum compiling to unify efficiency and practicality and thus facilitate the
exploration of quantum advantages.]]></summary>

performing channel estimation using posterior sampling at test time. We derive
theoretical robustness guarantees of channel estimation with posterior sampling
in single-input single-output scenarios, and show that the observations

Our results in simulated clustered delay line channels show competitive

rather than other complex architectures is balancing recognition accuracy and
the total number of training parameters. Herein, we measure the impact of
different settings required for generating more informative Mel-frequency
cepstral coefficient (MFCC), short-time Fourier transform (STFT), and discrete
wavelet transform (DWT) representations on our front-end model. This
measurement involves comparing the classification performance over the
adversarial robustness. We demonstrate an inverse relationship between
recognition accuracy and model robustness against six benchmarking attack
algorithms on the balance of average budgets allocated by the adversary and the
attack cost. Moreover, our experimental results have shown that while the
ResNet-18 model trained on DWT spectrograms achieves a high recognition
accuracy, attacking this model is relatively more costly for the adversary than
other 2D representations. We also report some results on different
convolutional neural network architectures such as ResNet-34, ResNet-56,
AlexNet, and GoogLeNet, SB-CNN, and LSTM-based.]]></summary>

of computer vision during the past few decades. As the core of CNNs, image
convolution operation helps CNNs to achieve good performance on image-related
tasks. However, image convolution is hard to be implemented and parallelized.
In this paper, we propose a novel neural network model, namely CEMNet, that can
be trained in frequency domain. The most important motivation of this research
is that we can use the very simple element-wise multiplication operation to
replace the image convolution in frequency domain based on Cross-Correlation
Theorem. We further introduce Weight Fixation Mechanism to alleviate
over-fitting, and analyze the working behavior of Batch Normalization, Leaky
ReLU and Dropout in frequency domain to design their counterparts for CEMNet.
Also, to deal with complex inputs brought by DFT, we design two branch network
structure for CEMNet. Experimental results imply that CEMNet works well in
frequency domain, and achieve good performance on MNIST and CIFAR-10 databases.
To our knowledge, CEMNet is the first model trained in Fourier Domain that
achieves more than 70\% validation accuracy on CIFAR-10 database.]]></summary>

treatment decisions to patients by considering patient heterogeneity. Common
methods for learning optimal DTRs, however, have shortcomings: they are
typically based on outcome prediction and not treatment effect estimation, or
they use linear models that are restrictive for patient data from modern
electronic health records. To address these shortcomings, we develop two novel
methods for learning optimal DTRs that effectively handle complex patient data.
We call our methods DTR-CT and DTR-CF. Our methods are based on a data-driven
estimation of heterogeneous treatment effects using causal tree methods,
specifically causal trees and causal forests, that learn non-linear
relationships, control for time-varying confounding, are doubly robust, and
explainable. To the best of our knowledge, our paper is the first that adapts
causal tree methods for learning optimal DTRs. We evaluate our proposed methods
using synthetic data and then apply them to real-world data from intensive care
units. Our methods outperform state-of-the-art baselines in terms of cumulative
regret and percentage of optimal decisions by a considerable margin. Our work
improves treatment recommendations from electronic health record and is thus of
direct relevance for personalized medicine.]]></summary>

providing provable error bounds for machine learning (ML) tasks while
significantly reducing the communication and computation costs. To achieve a
better trade-off between ML error bounds and costs, we propose the first
framework to incorporate quantization techniques into the process of coreset
construction. Specifically, we theoretically analyze the ML error bounds caused
by a combination of coreset construction and quantization. Based on that, we
formulate an optimization problem to minimize the ML error under a fixed budget
of communication cost. To improve the scalability for large datasets, we
identify two proxies of the original objective function, for which efficient
algorithms are developed. For the case of data on multiple nodes, we further
design a novel algorithm to allocate the communication budget to the nodes
while minimizing the overall ML error. Through extensive experiments on
multiple real-world datasets, we demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency
of our proposed algorithms for a variety of ML tasks. In particular, our
algorithms have achieved more than 90% data reduction with less than 10%

complex, dynamic environments. Adaptive control laws can endow even nonlinear
systems with good trajectory tracking performance, provided that any uncertain
dynamics terms are linearly parameterizable with known nonlinear features.
However, it is often difficult to specify such features a priori, such as for
aerodynamic disturbances on rotorcraft or interaction forces between a
manipulator arm and various objects. In this paper, we turn to data-driven
modeling with neural networks to learn, offline from past data, an adaptive
controller with an internal parametric model of these nonlinear features. Our
key insight is that we can better prepare the controller for deployment with
control-oriented meta-learning of features in closed-loop simulation, rather
than regression-oriented meta-learning of features to fit input-output data.
Specifically, we meta-learn the adaptive controller with closed-loop tracking
simulation as the base-learner and the average tracking error as the
meta-objective. With both fully-actuated and underactuated nonlinear planar
rotorcraft subject to wind, we demonstrate that our adaptive controller
outperforms other controllers trained with regression-oriented meta-learning
when deployed in closed-loop for trajectory tracking control.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Multi-Task Learning is a learning paradigm that uses correlated tasks to
improve performance generalization. A common way to learn multiple tasks is
through the hard parameter sharing approach, in which a single architecture is
used to share the same subset of parameters, creating an inductive bias between
them during the training process. Due to its simplicity, potential to improve
generalization, and reduce computational cost, it has gained the attention of
the scientific and industrial communities. However, tasks often conflict with
each other, which makes it challenging to define how the gradients of multiple
tasks should be combined to allow simultaneous learning. To address this
problem, we use the idea of multi-objective optimization to propose a method
that takes into account temporal behaviour of the gradients to create a dynamic
bias that adjust the importance of each task during the backpropagation. The
result of this method is to give more attention to the tasks that are diverging
or that are not being benefited during the last iterations, allowing to ensure
that the simultaneous learning is heading to the performance maximization of
all tasks. As a result, we empirically show that the proposed method
outperforms the state-of-art approaches on learning conflicting tasks. Unlike
the adopted baselines, our method ensures that all tasks reach good
generalization performances.]]></summary>

for our society. A key aspect of this sustainability is the ability of
computing systems to cope with the continuous change they face, ranging from
dynamic operating conditions, to changing goals, and technological progress.
While we are able to engineer smart computing systems that autonomously deal
with various types of changes, handling unanticipated changes requires system
evolution, which remains in essence a human-centered process. This will
eventually become unmanageable. To break through the status quo, we put forward
an arguable opinion for the vision of self-evolving computing systems that are
equipped with an evolutionary engine enabling them to evolve autonomously.
Specifically, when a self-evolving computing system detects conditions outside
its operational domain, such as an anomaly or a new goal, it activates an
evolutionary engine that runs online experiments to determine how the system
needs to evolve to deal with the changes, thereby evolving its architecture.
During this process the engine can integrate new computing elements that are
provided by computing warehouses. These computing elements provide
specifications and procedures enabling their automatic integration. We motivate
the need for self-evolving computing systems in light of the state of the art,
outline a conceptual architecture of self-evolving computing systems, and
illustrate the architecture for a future smart city mobility system that needs
to evolve continuously with changing conditions. To conclude, we highlight key
research challenges to realize the vision of self-evolving computing systems.]]></summary>

distinguish reliable results, and leverage them as pseudo labels to update a
student model for pose estimation on real data. To continuously improve the
quality of pseudo labels, we iterate the above steps by taking the trained
student model as a new teacher and re-label real data using the refined teacher
model. We evaluate our method on a public benchmark and our newly-released

metabolic information. One challenge of 1H-MRS is the low Signal-Noise Ratio
(SNR). To improve the SNR, a typical approach is to perform Signal Averaging
(SA) with M repeated samples. The data acquisition time, however, is increased
by M times accordingly, and a complete clinical MRS scan takes approximately 10
minutes at a common setting M=128. Recently, deep learning has been introduced
to improve the SNR but most of them use the simulated data as the training set.
This may hinder the MRS applications since some potential differences, such as
acquisition system imperfections, and physiological and psychologic conditions
may exist between the simulated and in vivo data. Here, we proposed a new
scheme that purely used the repeated samples of realistic data. A deep learning
model, Refusion Long Short-Term Memory (ReLSTM), was designed to learn the
mapping from the low SNR time-domain data (24 SA) to the high SNR one (128 SA).
Experiments on the in vivo brain spectra of 7 healthy subjects, 2 brain tumor
patients and 1 cerebral infarction patient showed that only using 20% repeated
samples, the denoised spectra by ReLSTM could provide comparable estimated
concentrations of metabolites to 128 SA. Compared with the state-of-the-art
low-rank denoising method, the ReLSTM achieved the lower relative error and the
Cram\'er-Rao lower bounds in quantifying some important biomarkers. In summary,
ReLSTM can perform high-fidelity denoising of the spectra under fast

subsumes Hahn's (2020) results that GUHAT cannot recognize the DYCK languages
or the PARITY language, since those languages are outside AC$^0$ (Furst et al.,

possible to efficiently predict the measurement probabilities associated with a
quantum circuit? Recent work of Caro and Datta (2020) studied the problem of
PAC learning quantum circuits in an information theoretic sense, leaving open
questions of computational efficiency. In particular, one candidate class of
circuits for which an efficient learner might have been possible was that of
Clifford circuits, since the corresponding set of states generated by such
circuits, called stabilizer states, are known to be efficiently PAC learnable
(Rocchetto 2018). Here we provide a negative result, showing that proper
learning of CNOT circuits is hard for classical learners unless $\textsf{RP} =
\textsf{NP}$. As the classical analogue and subset of Clifford circuits, this
naturally leads to a hardness result for Clifford circuits as well.
Additionally, we show that if $\textsf{RP} = \textsf{NP}$ then there would
exist efficient proper learning algorithms for CNOT and Clifford circuits. By
similar arguments, we also find that an efficient proper quantum learner for
such circuits exists if and only if $\textsf{NP} \subseteq \textsf{RQP}$.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In black-box optimization problems, we aim to maximize an unknown objective
function, where the function is only accessible through feedbacks of an
evaluation or simulation oracle. In real-life, the feedbacks of such oracles
are often noisy and available after some unknown delay that may depend on the
computation time of the oracle. Additionally, if the exact evaluations are
expensive but coarse approximations are available at a lower cost, the
feedbacks can have multi-fidelity. In order to address this problem, we propose
a generic extension of hierarchical optimistic tree search (HOO), called
ProCrastinated Tree Search (PCTS), that flexibly accommodates a delay and
noise-tolerant bandit algorithm. We provide a generic proof technique to
quantify regret of PCTS under delayed, noisy, and multi-fidelity feedbacks.
Specifically, we derive regret bounds of PCTS enabled with delayed-UCB1 (DUCB1)
and delayed-UCB-V (DUCBV) algorithms. Given a horizon $T$, PCTS retains the
regret bound of non-delayed HOO for expected delay of $O(\log T)$ and worsens
by $O(T^{\frac{1-\alpha}{d+2}})$ for expected delays of $O(T^{1-\alpha})$ for
$\alpha \in (0,1]$. We experimentally validate on multiple synthetic functions
and hyperparameter tuning problems that PCTS outperforms the state-of-the-art
black-box optimization methods for feedbacks with different noise levels,
delays, and fidelity.]]></summary>

received substantial attention for EEG signal analysis in the field of
brain-computer interfaces (BCIs). In this ongoing research area, the end-to-end
models are more favoured than traditional approaches requiring signal
transformation pre-classification. They can eliminate the need for prior
information from experts and the extraction of handcrafted features. However,
although several deep learning algorithms have been already proposed in the
literature, achieving high accuracies for classifying motor movements or mental
tasks, they often face a lack of interpretability and therefore are not quite
favoured by the neuroscience community. The reasons behind this issue can be
the high number of parameters and the sensitivity of deep neural networks to
capture tiny yet unrelated discriminative features. We propose an end-to-end
deep learning architecture called EEG-ITNet and a more comprehensible method to
visualise the network learned patterns. Using inception modules and causal
convolutions with dilation, our model can extract rich spectral, spatial, and
temporal information from multi-channel EEG signals with less complexity (in
terms of the number of trainable parameters) than other existing end-to-end
architectures, such as EEG-Inception and EEG-TCNet. By an exhaustive evaluation
on dataset 2a from BCI competition IV and OpenBMI motor imagery dataset,
EEG-ITNet shows up to 5.9\% improvement in the classification accuracy in
different scenarios with statistical significance compared to its competitors.
We also comprehensively explain and support the validity of network
illustration from a neuroscientific perspective. We have also made our code

clinical diagnosis. The training of new sonographers and deep learning based
algorithms for US image analysis usually requires a large amount of data.
However, obtaining and labeling large-scale US imaging data are not easy tasks,
especially for diseases with low incidence. Realistic US image synthesis can
alleviate this problem to a great extent. In this paper, we propose a
generative adversarial network (GAN) based image synthesis framework. Our main
contributions include: 1) we present the first work that can synthesize
realistic B-mode US images with high-resolution and customized texture editing
features; 2) to enhance structural details of generated images, we propose to
introduce auxiliary sketch guidance into a conditional GAN. We superpose the
edge sketch onto the object mask and use the composite mask as the network
input; 3) to generate high-resolution US images, we adopt a progressive
training strategy to gradually generate high-resolution images from
low-resolution images. In addition, a feature loss is proposed to minimize the
difference of high-level features between the generated and real images, which
further improves the quality of generated images; 4) the proposed US image
synthesis method is quite universal and can also be generalized to the US
images of other anatomical structures besides the three ones tested in our
study (lung, hip joint, and ovary); 5) extensive experiments on three large US
image datasets are conducted to validate our method. Ablation studies,
customized texture editing, user studies, and segmentation tests demonstrate
promising results of our method in synthesizing realistic US images.]]></summary>

intervention methods in the literature, most of them require a complete

missing patterns can depend on group attributes (e.g. gender or race). Simply
applying off-the-shelf fair learning algorithms to an imputed dataset may lead
to an unfair model. In this paper, we first theoretically analyze different
sources of discrimination risks when training with an imputed dataset. Then, we
propose an integrated approach based on decision trees that does not require a
separate process of imputation and learning. Instead, we train a tree with
missing incorporated as attribute (MIA), which does not require explicit
imputation, and we optimize a fairness-regularized objective function. We
demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing fairness intervention
methods applied to an imputed dataset, through several experiments on

Standard reinforcement learning algorithms maximize a scalar reward, which
requires combining different objective-specific rewards into a single number.
Alternatively, different objectives could also be combined at the level of
action value, such that specialist modules responsible for different objectives
submit different action suggestions to a decision process, each based on
rewards that are independent of one another. In this work, we explore the
potential benefits of this alternative strategy. We investigate a biologically
relevant multi-objective problem, the continual homeostasis of a set of
variables, and compare a monolithic deep Q-network to a modular network with a

global parameterisations can only exist if the level sets are connected. For
this purpose, we introduce a novel and flexible class of neural networks that
generalise input-convex networks. These networks represent functions that are
guaranteed to have connected level sets forming smooth manifolds on the input

systems. In contrast to traditional rule-based skill routing, state-of-the-art
systems use a model-based approach to enable natural conversations. To provide
supervision signal required to train such models, ideas such as human
annotation, replication of a rule-based system, relabeling based on user
paraphrases, and bandit-based learning were suggested. However, these
approaches: (a) do not scale in terms of the number of skills and skill
on-boarding, (b) require a very costly expert annotation/rule-design, (c)
introduce risks in the user experience with each model update. In this paper,
we present a scalable self-learning approach to explore routing alternatives
without causing abrupt policy changes that break the user experience, learn
from the user interaction, and incrementally improve the routing via frequent
model refreshes. To enable such robust frequent model updates, we suggest a
simple and effective approach that ensures controlled policy updates for
individual domains, followed by an off-policy evaluation for making deployment
decisions without any need for lengthy A/B experimentation. We conduct various
offline and online A/B experiments on a commercial large-scale conversational
system to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in real-world

$K$-armed stochastic bandit tasks. The tasks may be designed by an adversary,
but the adversary is constrained to choose the optimal arm of each task in a

(the bandit meta-learning setting), or unknown (the non-stationary bandit

algorithm based on a reduction to bandit submodular maximization, and show that
its regret in both settings is smaller than the simple baseline of
$\tilde{O}(\sqrt{KNT})$ that can be obtained by using standard algorithms
designed for non-stationary bandit problems. For the bandit meta-learning

is bounded as $\tilde{O}(N\sqrt{M \tau}+N^{2/3})$. Under additional assumptions

and create a sequential minimax optimal algorithm. Our algorithm works with a
more general partial monitoring setting, where, in contrast to the classical
bandit feedback, the losses can be revealed in an adversarial manner. Our
algorithm adopts a universal prediction perspective, whose performance is
analyzed with regret against a general expert selection sequence. The regret we
study is against a general competition class that covers many settings (such as
the switching or contextual experts settings) and the expert selection
sequences in the competition class are determined by the application at hand.
Our regret bounds are second order bounds in terms of the sum of squared losses

modeling (SVAM) for use by autonomous underwater robots. Our proposed model,
named SVAM-Net, integrates deep visual features at various scales and semantics
for effective salient object detection (SOD) in natural underwater images. The
SVAM-Net architecture is configured in a unique way to jointly accommodate
bottom-up and top-down learning within two separate branches of the network
while sharing the same encoding layers. We design dedicated spatial attention
modules (SAMs) along these learning pathways to exploit the coarse-level and
fine-level semantic features for SOD at four stages of abstractions. The
bottom-up branch performs a rough yet reasonably accurate saliency estimation
at a fast rate, whereas the deeper top-down branch incorporates a residual
refinement module (RRM) that provides fine-grained localization of the salient
objects. Extensive performance evaluation of SVAM-Net on benchmark datasets
clearly demonstrates its effectiveness for underwater SOD. We also validate its
generalization performance by several ocean trials' data that include test
images of diverse underwater scenes and waterbodies, and also images with
unseen natural objects. Moreover, we analyze its computational feasibility for
robotic deployments and demonstrate its utility in several important use cases
of visual attention modeling.]]></summary>

detector architectures amongst the institutions. The method was validated on an
independent data set using only a subset of EEG channels. The ensemble reaches
accuracy comparable to a single detector trained on all the data when
sufficient amount of data is available in each institution. The weighted mean

(NAS) is its demand for large computational resources, which hinders
scientifically sound empirical evaluations of NAS methods. Tabular NAS
benchmarks have alleviated this problem substantially, making it possible to
properly evaluate NAS methods in seconds on commodity machines. However, an
unintended consequence of tabular NAS benchmarks has been a focus on extremely
small architectural search spaces since their construction relies on exhaustive
evaluations of the space. This leads to unrealistic results that do not
transfer to larger spaces. To overcome this fundamental limitation, we propose
a methodology to create cheap NAS surrogate benchmarks for arbitrary search
spaces. We exemplify this approach by creating surrogate NAS benchmarks on the
existing tabular NAS-Bench-101 and on two widely used NAS search spaces with up
to $10^{21}$ architectures ($10^{13}$ times larger than any previous tabular
NAS benchmark). We show that surrogate NAS benchmarks can model the true
performance of architectures better than tabular benchmarks (at a small
fraction of the cost), that they lead to faithful estimates of how well
different NAS methods work on the original non-surrogate benchmark, and that
they can generate new scientific insight. We open-source all our code and
believe that surrogate NAS benchmarks are an indispensable tool to extend
scientifically sound work on NAS to large and exciting search spaces.]]></summary>

decisions for individuals based on a sensitive attribute (e.g., age, sex). In
domains where prediction accuracy is paramount, it could potentially be
acceptable to fit a model which exhibits disparate treatment. To evaluate the
effect of disparate treatment, we compare the performance of split classifiers
(i.e., classifiers trained and deployed separately on each group) with
group-blind classifiers (i.e., classifiers which do not use a sensitive
attribute). We introduce the benefit-of-splitting for quantifying the
performance improvement by splitting classifiers. Computing the
benefit-of-splitting directly from its definition could be intractable since it
involves solving optimization problems over an infinite-dimensional functional
space. Under different performance measures, we (i) prove an equivalent
expression for the benefit-of-splitting which can be efficiently computed by
solving small-scale convex programs; (ii) provide sharp upper and lower bounds
for the benefit-of-splitting which reveal precise conditions where a
group-blind classifier will always suffer from a non-trivial performance gap
from the split classifiers. In the finite sample regime, splitting is not
necessarily beneficial and we provide data-dependent bounds to understand this
effect. Finally, we validate our theoretical results through numerical
experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets.]]></summary>

functional approximation and prediction. While the representation properties of
DL have been well studied, uncertainty quantification remains challenging and
largely unexplored. Data augmentation techniques are a natural approach to
provide uncertainty quantification and to incorporate stochastic Monte Carlo
search into stochastic gradient descent (SGD) methods. The purpose of our paper
is to show that training DL architectures with data augmentation leads to
efficiency gains. We use the theory of scale mixtures of normals to derive data
augmentation strategies for deep learning. This allows variants of the
expectation-maximization and MCMC algorithms to be brought to bear on these
high dimensional nonlinear deep learning models. To demonstrate our
methodology, we develop data augmentation algorithms for a variety of commonly
used activation functions: logit, ReLU, leaky ReLU and SVM. Our methodology is
compared to traditional stochastic gradient descent with back-propagation. Our
optimization procedure leads to a version of iteratively re-weighted least
squares and can be implemented at scale with accelerated linear algebra methods
providing substantial improvement in speed. We illustrate our methodology on a
number of standard datasets. Finally, we conclude with directions for future
research.]]></summary>

function, Gaussian covariates and a regularized M-estimator $\hat\beta$
constructed from convex loss function and regularizer. In the regime where
sample size $n$ and dimension $p$ are both increasing such that $p/n$ has a
finite limit, the behavior of the empirical distribution of $\hat\beta$ and the
predicted values $X\hat\beta$ has been previously characterized in a number of
models: The empirical distributions are known to converge to proximal operators
of the loss and penalty in a related Gaussian sequence model, which captures
the interplay between ratio $p/n$, loss, regularization and the data generating
process. This connection between$(\hat\beta,X\hat\beta)$ and the corresponding
proximal operators require solving fixed-point equations that typically involve
unobservable quantities such as the prior distribution on the index or the link
function.

This paper develops a different theory to describe the empirical distribution
of $\hat\beta$ and $X\hat\beta$: Approximations of $(\hat\beta,X\hat\beta)$ in
terms of proximal operators are provided that only involve observable
adjustments. These proposed observable adjustments are data-driven, e.g., do
not require prior knowledge of the index or the link function. These new
adjustments yield confidence intervals for individual components of the index,
as well as estimators of the correlation of $\hat\beta$ with the index. The
interplay between loss, regularization and the model is thus captured in a
data-driven manner, without solving the fixed-point equations studied in
previous works. The results apply to both strongly convex regularizers and
unregularized M-estimation. Simulations are provided for the square and
logistic loss in single index models including logistic regression and 1-bit
compressed sensing with 20\% corrupted bits.]]></summary>

their characterization challenging. We consider two settings for the two input
variables, either both are random variables or one is a random variable and the
other is well-separated, i.e. there is a minimum distance between points. With
conditions on the dimension, the complexity ratio, and the sampling variance,
we show that the singular values of these matrices concentrate near their full
expectation and near one with high-probability. In particular, since the
dimension depends only on the logarithm of the number of random weights or the

for signals with complex spectral structure. A significant limitation of the
GPCM is that it assumes a rapidly decaying spectrum: it can only model smooth
signals. Moreover, inference in the GPCM currently requires (1) a mean-field
assumption, resulting in poorly calibrated uncertainties, and (2) a tedious
variational optimisation of large covariance matrices. We redesign the GPCM
model to induce a richer distribution over the spectrum with relaxed
assumptions about smoothness: the Causal Gaussian Process Convolution Model
(CGPCM) introduces a causality assumption into the GPCM, and the Rough Gaussian
Process Convolution Model (RGPCM) can be interpreted as a Bayesian
nonparametric generalisation of the fractional Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process. We
also propose a more effective variational inference scheme, going beyond the
mean-field assumption: we design a Gibbs sampler which directly samples from
the optimal variational solution, circumventing any variational optimisation
entirely. The proposed variations of the GPCM are validated in experiments on
synthetic and real-world data, showing promising results.]]></summary>

-- requires knowledge about the available options. Such knowledge is generally
acquired through costly trial and error, but this learning process can be
disrupted by competition. In this work, we study how competition affects the
long-term outcomes of individuals as they learn. We build on a line of work
that models this setting as a two-sided matching market with bandit learners. A
recent result in this area states that it is impossible to simultaneously
guarantee two natural desiderata: stability and low optimal regret for all
agents. Resource-allocating platforms can point to this result as a
justification for assigning good long-term outcomes to some agents and poor
ones to others. We show that this impossibility need not hold true. In
particular, by modeling two additional components of competition -- namely,
costs and transfers -- we prove that it is possible to simultaneously guarantee
four desiderata: stability, low optimal regret, fairness in the distribution of
regret, and high social welfare.]]></summary>

domains, ranging from product reviews in retailing to nursing notes in
healthcare. To leverage this information, words are typically translated into
word embeddings -- vectors that encode the semantic relationships between words
-- through unsupervised learning algorithms such as matrix factorization.
However, learning word embeddings from new domains with limited training data
can be challenging, because the meaning/usage may be different in the new
domain, e.g., the word "positive" typically has positive sentiment, but often
has negative sentiment in medical notes since it may imply that a patient is
tested positive for a disease. Intuitively, we expect that only a small number
of domain-specific words may have new meanings/usages. We propose an intuitive
two-stage estimator that exploits this structure via a group-sparse penalty to
efficiently transfer learn domain-specific word embeddings by combining
large-scale text corpora (such as Wikipedia) with limited domain-specific text
data. We bound the generalization error of our estimator, proving that it can
achieve the same accuracy (compared to not transfer learning) with
substantially less domain-specific data when only a small number of embeddings
are altered between domains. Our results provide the first bounds on
group-sparse matrix factorization, which may be of independent interest. We
empirically evaluate the effectiveness of our approach compared to
state-of-the-art fine-tuning heuristics from natural language processing.]]></summary>

However, this strongly limits the use of these models inside audio generation
setups, as most creative workflows are based on real-time digital signal
processing. Although approaches based on recurrent networks can be naturally
adapted to this buffer-based computation, the use of convolutions still poses
some serious challenges. To tackle this issue, the use of causal streaming
convolutions have been proposed. However, this requires specific complexified
training and can impact the resulting audio quality.

In this paper, we introduce a new method allowing to produce non-causal
streaming models. This allows to make any convolutional model compatible with
real-time buffer-based processing. As our method is based on a post-training
reconfiguration of the model, we show that it is able to transform models
trained without causal constraints into a streaming model. We show how our
method can be adapted to fit complex architectures with parallel branches. To
evaluate our method, we apply it on the recent RAVE model, which provides
high-quality real-time audio synthesis. We test our approach on multiple music
and speech datasets and show that it is faster than overlap-add methods, while
having no impact on the generation quality. Finally, we introduce two
open-source implementation of our work as Max/MSP and PureData externals, and
as a VST audio plugin. This allows to endow traditional digital audio
workstation with real-time neural audio synthesis on a laptop CPU.]]></summary>

$\mathbb{P}$ more effectively than i.i.d. sampling or standard thinning. Given
a suitable reproducing kernel $\mathbf{k}$ and $\mathcal{O}(n^2)$ time, kernel
thinning compresses an $n$-point approximation to $\mathbb{P}$ into a
$\sqrt{n}$-point approximation with comparable worst-case integration error
across the associated reproducing kernel Hilbert space. With high probability,
the maximum discrepancy in integration error is
$\mathcal{O}_d(n^{-1/2}\sqrt{\log n})$ for compactly supported $\mathbb{P}$ and
$\mathcal{O}_d(n^{-\frac{1}{2}} (\log n)^{(d+1)/2}\sqrt{\log\log n})$ for
sub-exponential $\mathbb{P}$ on $\mathbb{R}^d$. In contrast, an equal-sized
i.i.d. sample from $\mathbb{P}$ suffers $\Omega(n^{-1/4})$ integration error.
Our sub-exponential guarantees resemble the classical quasi-Monte Carlo error
rates for uniform $\mathbb{P}$ on $[0,1]^d$ but apply to general distributions
on $\mathbb{R}^d$ and a wide range of common kernels. We use our results to
derive explicit non-asymptotic maximum mean discrepancy bounds for Gaussian,
Mat\'ern, and B-spline kernels and present two vignettes illustrating the
practical benefits of kernel thinning over i.i.d. sampling and standard Markov
chain Monte Carlo thinning, in dimensions $d=2$ through $100$.]]></summary>

analysis more accessible, by separating probabilistic modelling from
probabilistic inference. In practice this decoupling is difficult. No single
inference algorithm can be used as a probabilistic programming back-end that is
simultaneously reliable, efficient, black-box, and general. Probabilistic
programming languages often choose a single algorithm to apply to a given
problem, thus inheriting its limitations. While substantial work has been done
both to formalise probabilistic programming and to improve efficiency of
inference, there has been little work that makes use of the available program
structure, by formally analysing it, to better utilise the underlying inference
algorithm.

This dissertation presents three novel techniques (both static and dynamic),
which aim to improve probabilistic programming using program analysis. The
techniques analyse a probabilistic program and adapt it to make inference more
efficient, sometimes in a way that would have been tedious or impossible to do
by hand.]]></summary>

treatment decisions to patients by considering patient heterogeneity. Common
methods for learning optimal DTRs, however, have shortcomings: they are
typically based on outcome prediction and not treatment effect estimation, or
they use linear models that are restrictive for patient data from modern
electronic health records. To address these shortcomings, we develop two novel
methods for learning optimal DTRs that effectively handle complex patient data.
We call our methods DTR-CT and DTR-CF. Our methods are based on a data-driven
estimation of heterogeneous treatment effects using causal tree methods,
specifically causal trees and causal forests, that learn non-linear
relationships, control for time-varying confounding, are doubly robust, and
explainable. To the best of our knowledge, our paper is the first that adapts
causal tree methods for learning optimal DTRs. We evaluate our proposed methods
using synthetic data and then apply them to real-world data from intensive care
units. Our methods outperform state-of-the-art baselines in terms of cumulative
regret and percentage of optimal decisions by a considerable margin. Our work
improves treatment recommendations from electronic health record and is thus of

where the dimensions of the crossed groups are arbitrarily large, streamlining

Because of this fact we also consider a hierarchy of relaxations of the mean
field product restriction. The least stringent product restriction delivers a
high degree of inferential accuracy. However, this accuracy must be mitigated
against its higher storage and computing demands. Faster sparse storage and
computing alternatives are also provided, but come with the price of diminished

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Particle identification (PID) is one of the main strengths of the ALICE
experiment at the LHC. It is a crucial ingredient for detailed studies of the
strongly interacting matter formed in ultrarelativistic heavy-ion collisions.
ALICE provides PID information via various experimental techniques, allowing
for the identification of particles over a broad momentum range (from around
100 MeV/$c$ to around 50 GeV/$c$). The main challenge is how to combine the
information from various detectors effectively. Therefore, PID represents a
model classification problem, which can be addressed using Machine Learning
(ML) solutions. Moreover, the complexity of the detector and richness of the
detection techniques make PID an interesting area of research also for the
computer science community. In this work, we show the current status of the ML
approach to PID in ALICE. We discuss the preliminary work with the Random
Forest approach for the LHC Run 2 and a more advanced solution based on Domain
Adaptation Neural Networks, including a proposal for its future implementation
within the ALICE computing software for the upcoming LHC Run 3.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Example: I fed 32 feature maps of dimension 6x6x32 into a Squeeze and Excitation layer, which assigns a weight to each of my channel through a channel-wise attention mechanism. 
 What is the difference between passing these 32 feature maps into a Hybrid Transformer Encoder with patch of dimension 6x6? (So 1 patch for each channel)
 As I understand it, channel attention says "which channel is important for the final prediction". While transformer (with self attention) tells us "where to focus our attention in a given context".
 Isn't that the same if the patches are the channels? Basically it tells us on which patch to focus, and if patch=channel then squeeze excitation = self attention ?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’m really new to RL so please bear with me if I’m making mistakes here, but I’m trying to make an environment that emulates a network of roads. The algorithm will need to generate a quick route between n destinations when n equals some number with an insane amount of permutations, like 30 for example. This is like emulating the destinations required by a mailman’s route on a map, and trying to find the fastest way to get to each one.
 The algorithms sequence of decisions will be choosing a node to travel to, while each node represents an street intersection or point where the street ends. By the time it’s traveled to every destination using the nodes, it’ll review the network of nodes it used and sum the distance between each one to get total distance of route. 
 The goal is to get the total distance as small as possible. Is this realistic for a RL problem, or do I need to try to engineer some way to determine if every decision was either good or bad? Could I build a mathematical way to approximate the quickest route and then reward the RL algorithm by generating a better route than the mathematically approximated one?
 I could try rewarding the algorithm at each decision by whether it reduced the total distance required to any target it has yet to visit. I could try to mathematically make this more viable… what do y’all think,should I do something like that? Am I headed in the right direction? 
 Thanks for any and all help!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Large language models can encode a wealth of semantic knowledge about the world. Such knowledge could in principle be extremely useful to robots aiming to act upon high-level, temporally extended instructions expressed in natural language. However, a significant weakness of language models is that they lack contextual grounding, which makes it difficult to leverage them for decision making within a given real-world context. For example, asking a language model to describe how to clean a spill might result in a reasonable narrative, but it may not be applicable to a particular agent, such as a robot, that needs to perform this task in a particular environment. We propose to provide this grounding by means of pretrained behaviors, which are used to condition the model to propose natural language actions that are both feasible and contextually appropriate. The robot can act as the language model’s “hands and eyes,” while the language model supplies high-level semantic knowledge about the task. We show how low-level tasks can be combined with large language models so that the language model provides high-level knowledge about the procedures for performing complex and temporally extended instructions, while value functions associated with these tasks provide the grounding necessary to connect this knowledge to a particular physical environment. We evaluate our method on a number of real-world robotic tasks, where we show that this approach is capable of completing long-horizon, abstract, natural language instructions on a mobile manipulator.

 Yet when I look at jobs, I see very seldom postings about it.
 I am wondering why is it the case ? From my current understanding I could think of dozens of applications with huge potential gains. It feel like an untapped potential.
 Or am I missing something ? What do you think is the big obstacle to wider adoption to RL ? Do you think it overlaps with classical control at the moment and is not justified ?

 I'm currently working on a project that focuses on GANs and generative art, particularly images that concern visual indeterminacy. I trying to find papers/articles that discuss the development/application of (any kind of) GAN in which along the way or as a final result, images were generated that would be considered visually indeterminate. Specifically, research in which the objective was to generate images with clear, recognizable objects/scenes.
 In my mind I'm looking for articles in which the GAN architecture is discussed and in which ways what parts of it could've influenced the particular aspects of the incorrectly generated image. This probably wouldn't be the focus of any research but I was wondering if anyone has ever come across a discussion section in a GAN paper or could point me towards some areas or projects where I might find something that I could connect to my project.

 They describe one part of their model as "3-layer feed-forward networks with hidden dimensions of 1024 and 256, GeLU as the activation function and a dropout with probability 0.1 applied at their input."
 For me that's not enough information to uniquely characterize the network, but maybe for someone with more experience the intended structure is obvious. The output should be a scalar, so i assume that it's something like:
 Dropout(0.1) -> Linear(<input dim>, 1024) -> Linear(1024, 256) -> GELU -> Linear(256, 1) ?
 Or is the nonlinearity (GELU) normally applied after each step?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So I would be curious about the theoretical foundations how to make sense of higher-level abstract reasoning like reasoning about infinities, incomputability, truth (which we know cannot be defined due to Tarski) in the field of artificial intelligence. It seems due to Gödel-like constructions you are forced into inconsistent systems of reasoning when operating within a computable system. But those prove everything and "nothing", so as far as I understand it, it kind of upends the whole system of reason that the notion of artificial intelligence (and correct functioning of it) is based in.
 Personally due to this I don't see that the notion in the title it is a particularly coherent notion, which means there is somewhat strong limits on what (computable) AI will be able to do. But I would be curious how people that think otherwise (which seem most in the AI community?) approach this. Would you say somehow inconsistency can be avoided, or that despite inconsistency you can get reliably correct results?

 This implementation has MANY missing details, such as Unet Models etc. I think it is worth taking a look, especially if you are interested in recent boom of diffusion models (such as Dalle 2)

 Since it was built in the image of Borg (where search indexers and map reduce jobs were preemptible, and serving search workloads had to be protected at all cost)[1], how is Kubernetes holding up for your current workflows? Are you using Kubeflow? metaflow? bespoke setup on top?

The ability to classify images into categories has been transformed by deep learning. It has also been significantly accelerated by transfer learning, whereby models are first pre-trained on large datasets, like ImageNet, to learn visual representations that are then transferred via fine-tuning to a new task with less data (e.g., classifying animals). Previous works such as BiT and ViT employed these methods to achieve state-of-the-art performance on a wide range of classification tasks, such as the VTAB benchmark. 
However, fine-tuning has some downsides: though pre-training is done only once, fine-tuning is necessary on every new dataset for which task-specific data is needed. Multimo…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Machine learning and Artificial Intelligence models have gained promising results in recent years. The major factor behind their success is the availability and development of vast datasets. However, regardless of how many terabytes of data you have or how skilled you are at data science, machine learning models will be useless and even dangerous if you can’t make sense of data records.
 A slice is a collection of data samples with a common feature. For example, in a picture dataset, photographs of antique vehicles make up a slice. When a model’s performance on the data samples in a slice is significantly lower than its overall performance, the slice is considered underperforming.
 Deploying models underperforming on crucial data slices could seriously harm safety and fairness. For instance, models trained to detect collapsed lungs in chest X-rays generally make predictions based on the presence of chest drains, a common therapeutic device. As a result, computer models typically fail to detect collapsed lungs in images without chest drains, a critical data slice in which inaccurate negative predictions could be catastrophic.
 Not many studies have considered underperforming slices during model evaluation. Researchers believe that knowing which slices their models underperform would help practitioners not just make better decisions regarding model deployment but also improve model robustness by upgrading the training dataset or utilizing robust optimization strategies.
 Detecting slices is challenging because the “hidden” data slices are linked by a notion that isn’t easily derived from unstructured inputs or labeled in metadata (e.g., images, video, time-series data).

 Good models are hard
 In my experience from managing our CNN-based text classification & NER model at a small media analytics startup, evaluating and improving models is a mess. Our domain is fairly niche and diverse, so getting enough training data has been challenging and I mix in custom synthetics & augmentations (which can cause weird model artifacts if you're not careful). It takes a lot of time to discover tricky failure cases by either 1) observing production traffic or 2) probing manually, and then it takes even more time to get the right data to improve model behavior. 
 Are good models hard?
 What's your approach to model evaluation & targeted improvement? Are there any known best practices? I'm a bit at a loss here. As mentioned, I'm specifically interested in others who have deep models as an important part of their product or pipeline across any task or modality. More particularly:
  
How wrong is your model? How do you test it? How would you know about errors before and after it's deployed?
 How much of your time do you spend on iterating on your models? For what kind of issue? 
 Which aspects are most useful to you for improving model performance and reducing critical errors?
  
Maybe I'll take some of the more general ideas from my work and build them out into an evaluation & iteration framework. It's currently a hybrid web of synthetic, interactive/probing and classical approaches. Or maybe there is some approach/library that makes iteration easier without me having to do anything :)

 I am slightly confused in scenarios where probability of moving up, down, left and right are not provided or stated. In this scenario, I assume we assume the optimal policy and therefore, you would apply the Bellman equation as:
 V(s)=maxa(R(s,a)+γV(s′))
 Cost for any movement is 0 and an agent can choose to terminate at a numbered grid to collect a reward amount of the grid number. This is why my square closest to the reward takes in the value 8 since it will terminate with the action to the next state to collect the reward.
 Would this be the correct way to determine the value for the surrounding grid squares?

I've also heard from some of my friends that they had to learn Rust as a first thing in an ML company (it's their first job so they couldn't explain to me exactly why).
 My questions are:
  
What are pros and cons over Python?
 Are there any good frameworks in Rust for ML?
 Are there a decent community & documentation for Rust?
 Is learning it a fun experience?
 Is it used only for deployment?
  
 The reason I'm asking this is that I really love to learn by doing. And so, if I engaged in learning a bit of Rust for ML purposes, would I be able to create something ML-like right of the bat? It can be something as simple as MNIST classifier
  
Take note that I don't know anything about Rust, so these questions might seem noob-like. But I believe that the answers can be of help to others as well.

 I was curious if there were any heuristics for how many models to include in a bagging ensemble? 
 Also, more generally, am I on the correct path, or is there a better direction given my situation? A different ensemble technique, or a different path all together?

to such exploration after a goal is reached as 'post-exploration'. In this
paper we present a systematic study of post-exploration, answering open
questions that the Go-Explore paper did not answer yet. First, we study the
isolated potential of post-exploration, by turning it on and off within the
same algorithm. Subsequently, we introduce new methodology to adaptively decide
when to post-explore and for how long to post-explore. Experiments on a range
of MiniGrid environments show that post-exploration indeed boosts performance
(with a bigger impact than tuning regular exploration parameters), and this
effect is further enhanced by adaptively deciding when and for how long to
post-explore. In short, our work identifies adaptive post-exploration as a

according to how informative they are about latent diseases, given a pattern of

increasing interest in their ability to perform a fast approximation of
effective hydrodynamic parameters in porous media research and applications.
This paper presents a novel methodology for permeability prediction from
micro-CT scans of geological rock samples. The training data set for CNNs
dedicated to permeability prediction consists of permeability labels that are
typically generated by classical lattice Boltzmann methods (LBM) that simulate
the flow through the pore space of the segmented image data. We instead perform
direct numerical simulation (DNS) by solving the stationary Stokes equation in
an efficient and distributed-parallel manner. As such, we circumvent the
convergence issues of LBM that frequently are observed on complex pore
geometries, and therefore, improve the generality and accuracy of our training
data set. Using the DNS-computed permeabilities, a physics-informed CNN PhyCNN)
is trained by additionally providing a tailored characteristic quantity of the
pore space. More precisely, by exploiting the connection to flow problems on a
graph representation of the pore space, additional information about confined
structures is provided to the network in terms of the maximum flow value, which
is the key innovative component of our workflow. The robustness of this
approach is reflected by very high prediction accuracy, which is observed for a
variety of sandstone samples from archetypal rock formations.]]></summary>

increase the efficiency of stochastic reliability analyses in geotechnical
engineering. This paper presents a highly efficient ML aided reliability
technique that is able to accurately predict the results of a Monte Carlo (MC)
reliability study, and yet performs 500 times faster. A complete MC reliability
analysis on anisotropic heterogeneous slopes consisting of 120,000 simulated
samples is conducted in parallel to the proposed ML aided stochastic technique.
Comparing the results of the complete MC study and the proposed ML aided
technique, the expected errors of the proposed method are realistically
examined. Circumventing the time-consuming computation of factors of safety for
the training datasets, the proposed technique is more efficient than previous
methods. Different ML models, including Random Forest (RF), Support Vector
Machine (SVM) and Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) are presented, optimised and
compared. The effects of the size and type of training and testing datasets are
discussed. The expected errors of the ML predicted probability of failure are
characterised by different levels of soil heterogeneity and anisotropy. Using
only 1% of MC samples to train ML surrogate models, the proposed technique can
accurately predict the probability of failure with mean errors limited to 0.7%.
The proposed technique reduces the computational time required for our study
from 306 days to only 14 hours, providing 500 times higher efficiency.]]></summary>

biology knowledge in KGs can enhance protein representation with external
knowledge. In this work, we propose OntoProtein, the first general framework
that makes use of structure in GO (Gene Ontology) into protein pre-training
models. We construct a novel large-scale knowledge graph that consists of GO
and its related proteins, and gene annotation texts or protein sequences
describe all nodes in the graph. We propose novel contrastive learning with
knowledge-aware negative sampling to jointly optimize the knowledge graph and
protein embedding during pre-training. Experimental results show that
OntoProtein can surpass state-of-the-art methods with pre-trained protein
language models in TAPE benchmark and yield better performance compared with
baselines in protein-protein interaction and protein function prediction. Code

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Goal-conditioned Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning (HRL) is a promising
approach for scaling up reinforcement learning (RL) techniques. However, it
often suffers from training inefficiency as the action space of the high-level,
i.e., the goal space, is large. Searching in a large goal space poses
difficulty for both high-level subgoal generation and low-level policy
learning. In this paper, we show that this problem can be effectively
alleviated by restricting the high-level action space from the whole goal space
to a $k$-step adjacent region of the current state using an adjacency
constraint. We theoretically prove that in a deterministic Markov Decision
Process (MDP), the proposed adjacency constraint preserves the optimal
hierarchical policy, while in a stochastic MDP the adjacency constraint induces
a bounded state-value suboptimality determined by the MDP's transition
structure. We further show that this constraint can be practically implemented
by training an adjacency network that can discriminate between adjacent and
non-adjacent subgoals. Experimental results on discrete and continuous control
tasks including challenging simulated robot locomotion and manipulation tasks
show that incorporating the adjacency constraint significantly boosts the
performance of state-of-the-art goal-conditioned HRL approaches.]]></summary>

from other vehicles is that there is no sensor information. We use a set of

inference. Learning how all vehicles drive helps predict their behavior at test

predict whether the sample was in the model's training set. A common
countermeasure against MI attacks is to utilize differential privacy (DP)
during model training to mask the presence of individual examples. While this
use of DP is a principled approach to limit the efficacy of MI attacks, there
is a gap between the bounds provided by DP and the empirical performance of MI
attacks. In this paper, we derive bounds for the \textit{advantage} of an
adversary mounting a MI attack, and demonstrate tightness for the widely-used
Gaussian mechanism. We further show bounds on the \textit{confidence} of MI
attacks. Our bounds are much stronger than those obtained by DP analysis. For
example, analyzing a setting of DP-SGD with $\epsilon=4$ would obtain an upper
bound on the advantage of $\approx0.36$ based on our analyses, while getting
bound of $\approx 0.97$ using the analysis of previous work that convert
$\epsilon$ to membership inference bounds.

Finally, using our analysis, we provide MI metrics for models trained on
CIFAR10 dataset. To the best of our knowledge, our analysis provides the
state-of-the-art membership inference bounds for the privacy.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The goal of this work is to propose a robust, fast, and fully automatic
method for personalized cranial defect reconstruction and implant modeling.

We propose a two-step deep learning-based method using a modified U-Net
architecture to perform the defect reconstruction, and a dedicated iterative
procedure to improve the implant geometry, followed by automatic generation of
models ready for 3-D printing. We propose a cross-case augmentation based on
imperfect image registration combining cases from different datasets. We
perform ablation studies regarding different augmentation strategies and
compare them to other state-of-the-art methods.

We evaluate the method on three datasets introduced during the AutoImplant
2021 challenge, organized jointly with the MICCAI conference. We perform the
quantitative evaluation using the Dice and boundary Dice coefficients, and the
Hausdorff distance. The average Dice coefficient, boundary Dice coefficient,
and the 95th percentile of Hausdorff distance are 0.91, 0.94, and 1.53 mm
respectively. We perform an additional qualitative evaluation by 3-D printing
and visualization in mixed reality to confirm the implant's usefulness.

We propose a complete pipeline that enables one to create the cranial implant
model ready for 3-D printing. The described method is a greatly extended
version of the method that scored 1st place in all AutoImplant 2021 challenge
tasks. We freely release the source code, that together with the open datasets,
makes the results fully reproducible. The automatic reconstruction of cranial
defects may enable manufacturing personalized implants in a significantly
shorter time, possibly allowing one to perform the 3-D printing process
directly during a given intervention. Moreover, we show the usability of the
defect reconstruction in mixed reality that may further reduce the surgery
time.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As machine learning models are deployed ever more broadly, it becomes
increasingly important that they are not only able to perform well on their
training distribution, but also yield accurate predictions when confronted with
distribution shift. The Distributionally Robust Optimization (DRO) framework
proposes to address this issue by training models to minimize their expected
risk under a collection of distributions, to imitate test-time shifts. This is
most commonly achieved by instance-level re-weighting of the training objective
to emulate the likelihood ratio with possible test distributions, which allows
for estimating their empirical risk via importance sampling (assuming that they
are subpopulations of the training distribution). However, re-weighting schemes
in the literature are usually limited due to the difficulty of keeping the
optimization problem tractable and the complexity of enforcing normalization
constraints. In this paper, we show that three simple ideas -- mini-batch level
normalization, a KL penalty and simultaneous gradient updates -- allow us to
train models with DRO using a broader class of parametric likelihood ratios. In
a series of experiments on both image and text classification benchmarks, we
find that models trained with the resulting parametric adversaries are
consistently more robust to subpopulation shifts when compared to other DRO
approaches, and that the method performs reliably well with little
hyper-parameter tuning. Code to reproduce our experiments can be found at

terrain, and ground vehicle simulation, to predict traversability.
Traversability is expressed as three independent measures: the ability to
traverse the terrain at a target speed, energy consumption, and acceleration.
The measures are continuous and reflect different objectives for planning that
go beyond binary classification. A deep neural network is trained to predict
the traversability measures from the local heightmap and target speed. To
produce training data, we use an articulated vehicle with wheeled bogie
suspensions and procedurally generated terrains. We evaluate the model on
laser-scanned forest terrains, previously unseen by the model. The model
predicts traversability with an accuracy of 90%. Predictions rely on features
from the high-dimensional terrain data that surpass local roughness and slope
relative to the heading. Correlations show that the three traversability
measures are complementary to each other. With an inference speed 3000 times
faster than the ground truth simulation and trivially parallelizable, the model
is well suited for traversability analysis and optimal path planning over large
areas.]]></summary>

networks, a massive amount of data related to comment texts has been generated
on web applications or social media platforms like Twitter. Due to this, people
have actively started proliferating general information and the information
related to political opinions, which becomes an important reason for analyzing
public reactions. Most researchers have used social media specifics or contents
to analyze and predict public opinion concerning political events. This
research proposes an analytical study using Israeli political Twitter data to
interpret public opinion towards the Palestinian-Israeli conflict. The
attitudes of ethnic groups and opinion leaders in the form of tweets are
analyzed using Machine Learning algorithms like Support Vector Classifier
(SVC), Decision Tree (DT), and Naive Bayes (NB). Finally, a comparative

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The demand of probabilistic time series forecasting has been recently raised
in various dynamic system scenarios, for example, system identification and
prognostic and health management of machines. To this end, we combine the
advances in both deep generative models and state space model (SSM) to come up
with a novel, data-driven deep probabilistic sequence model. Specifically, we
follow the popular encoder-decoder generative structure to build the recurrent
neural networks (RNN) assisted variational sequence model on an augmented
recurrent input space, which could induce rich stochastic sequence dependency.
Besides, in order to alleviate the inconsistency issue of the posterior between
training and predicting as well as improving the mining of dynamic patterns, we
(i) propose using a lagged hybrid output as input for the posterior at next
time step, which brings training and predicting into alignment; and (ii)
further devise a generalized auto-regressive strategy that encodes all the
historical dependencies for the posterior. Thereafter, we first investigate the
methodological characteristics of the proposed deep probabilistic sequence
model on toy cases, and then comprehensively demonstrate the superiority of our
model against existing deep probabilistic SSM models through extensive
numerical experiments on eight system identification benchmarks from various
dynamic systems. Finally, we apply our sequence model to a real-world
centrifugal compressor forecasting problem, and again verify its outstanding
performance by quantifying the time series predictive distribution.]]></summary>

spaces have properties not conducive to search, e.g., multimodality,
discontinuities, or deception. To address such difficulties, considerable
research has been performed on creating novel evolutionary algorithms or
specialized genetic operators. However, if the representation that defined the
search space could be altered such that it only permitted valid solutions that
satisfied the constraints, the task of finding the optimal would be made more
feasible without any need for specialized optimization algorithms. We propose
Constrained Optimization in Latent Space (COIL), which uses a VAE to generate a
learned latent representation from a dataset comprising samples from the valid
region of the search space according to a constraint, thus enabling the
optimizer to find the objective in the new space defined by the learned
representation. Preliminary experiments show promise: compared to an identical
GA using a standard representation that cannot meet the constraints or find fit
solutions, COIL with its learned latent representation can perfectly satisfy
different types of constraints while finding high-fitness solutions.]]></summary>

far from its training data. With desirable characteristics, reconstruction
autoencoder-based methods deal with this problem by using input reconstruction

query for a proxy of conditional data uncertainty. Accordingly, an improvement
direction is formalized as maximumly compressing the autoencoder's latent space
while ensuring its reconstructive power for acting as a described domain
translator. From it, strategies are introduced including semantic
reconstruction, data certainty decomposition and normalized L2 distance to
substantially improve original methods, which together establish
state-of-the-art performance on various benchmarks, e.g., the FPR@95%TPR of
CIFAR-100 vs. TinyImagenet-crop on Wide-ResNet is 0.2%. Importantly, our method

participation and open access via the web, are becoming a modish way for online
and distance education. To help users have a better study experience, many MOOC
platforms have provided the services of recommending courses to users. However,
we argue that directly recommending a course to users will ignore the expertise
levels of different users. To fill this gap, this paper studies the problem of
concept recommendation in a more fine-grained view. We propose a novel
Heterogeneous Information Networks based Concept Recommender with Reinforcement
Learning (HinCRec-RL) incorporated for concept recommendation in MOOCs.
Specifically, we first formulate the concept recommendation in MOOCs as a
reinforcement learning problem to better model the dynamic interaction among
users and knowledge concepts. In addition, to mitigate the data sparsity issue
which also exists in many other recommendation tasks, we consider a
heterogeneous information network (HIN) among users, courses, videos and
concepts, to better learn the semantic representation of users. In particular,
we use the meta-paths on HIN to guide the propagation of users' preferences and
propose a heterogeneous graph attention network to represent the meta-paths. To
validate the effectiveness of our proposed approach, we conduct comprehensive
experiments on a real-world dataset from XuetangX, a popular MOOC platform from
China. The promising results show that our proposed approach can outperform
other baselines.]]></summary>

the size of causal and non-causal encoders to improve quality and fit

challenging; their performance highly depends on the nature of the surrounding
environment, such as density and heights of the ground BSs. On the other hand,
tall buildings might block undesired interference signals from ground BSs,
thereby improving the connectivity between the UAVs and their serving BSs. To
address the connectivity of UAVs in such environments, this paper proposes a RL
algorithm to dynamically optimise the height of a UAV as it moves through the
environment, with the goal of increasing the throughput or spectrum efficiency
that it experiences. The proposed solution is evaluated in two settings: using
a series of generated environments where we vary the number of BS and building
densities, and in a scenario using real-world data obtained from an experiment
in Dublin, Ireland. Results show that our proposed RL-based solution improves
UAVs QoS by 6% to 41%, depending on the scenario. We also conclude that, when
flying at heights higher than the buildings, building density variation has no
impact on UAV QoS. On the other hand, BS density can negatively impact UAV QoS,
with higher numbers of BSs generating more interference and deteriorating UAV
performance.]]></summary>

isolates around 10% of the slices per 3D image stack and can scale across

the paradigm of knowledge discovery, which greatly promotes domain
intelligence. However, the current activation function of DNER fails to treat
gradient vanishing, no negative output or non-differentiable existence, which
may impede knowledge exploration caused by the omission and incomplete
representation of latent semantics. To break through the dilemma, we present a
novel activation function termed KDAC. Detailly, KDAC is an aggregation
function with multiple conversion modes. The backbone of the activation region
is the interaction between exponent and linearity, and the both ends extend
through adaptive linear divergence, which surmounts the obstacle of gradient
vanishing and no negative output. Crucially, the non-differentiable points are
alerted and eliminated by an approximate smoothing algorithm. KDAC has a series
of brilliant properties, including nonlinear, stable near-linear transformation
and derivative, as well as dynamic style, etc. We perform experiments based on
BERT-BiLSTM-CNN-CRF model on six benchmark datasets containing different domain
knowledge, such as Weibo, Clinical, E-commerce, Resume, HAZOP and People's
daily. The evaluation results show that KDAC is advanced and effective, and can
provide more generalized activation to stimulate the performance of DNER. We
hope that KDAC can be exploited as a promising activation function to devote

numerous applications. Meanwhile, the documentation practice for machine
learning models often falls short of established practices for traditional
software components, which impedes model accountability, inadvertently abets
inappropriate or misuse of models, and may trigger negative social impact.
Recently, model cards, a template for documenting machine learning models, have
attracted notable attention, but their impact on the practice of model
documentation is unclear. In this work, we examine publicly available model
cards and other similar documentation. Our analysis reveals a substantial gap
between the suggestions made in the original model card work and the content in
actual documentation. Motivated by this observation and literature on fields
such as software documentation, interaction design, and traceability, we
further propose a set of design guidelines that aim to support the
documentation practice for machine learning models including (1) the
collocation of documentation environment with the coding environment, (2)
nudging the consideration of model card sections during model development, and
(3) documentation derived from and traced to the source. We designed a

contains an arbitrary number of elements, the task of temporal sets prediction
aims to predict the elements in the subsequent set. Previous studies for
temporal sets prediction mainly capture each user's evolutionary preference by
learning from his/her own sequence. Although insightful, we argue that: 1) the
collaborative signals latent in different users' sequences are essential but
have not been exploited; 2) users also tend to show stationary preferences
while existing methods fail to consider. To this end, we propose an integrated
learning framework to model both the evolutionary and the stationary
preferences of users for temporal sets prediction, which first constructs a
universal sequence by chronologically arranging all the user-set interactions,
and then learns on each user-set interaction. In particular, for each user-set
interaction, we first design an evolutionary user preference modelling
component to track the user's time-evolving preference and exploit the latent
collaborative signals among different users. This component maintains a memory
bank to store memories of the related user and elements, and continuously
updates their memories based on the currently encoded messages and the past
memories. Then, we devise a stationary user preference modelling module to
discover each user's personalized characteristics according to the historical
sequence, which adaptively aggregates the previously interacted elements from
dual perspectives with the guidance of the user's and elements' embeddings.
Finally, we develop a set-batch algorithm to improve the model efficiency,
which can create time-consistent batches in advance and achieve 3.5x training
speedups on average. Experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate the

(e.g., researchers co-authoring a paper and ingredients used together in a
recipe), each of which corresponds to a hyperedge (i.e., a subset of nodes).
Predicting future or missing hyperedges bears significant implication for many
applications (e.g., collaboration and recipe recommendation). What makes
hyperedge prediction particularly challenging is the vast number of
non-hyperedge subsets, which grows exponentially with the number of nodes.
Since it is prohibitive to use all of them as negative examples for model
training, it is inevitable to sample a very small portion of them, and to this
end, heuristic sampling schemes have been employed. However, trained models
suffer from poor generalization capability for examples of different natures.
In this paper, we propose AHP, an adversarial training-based
hyperedge-prediction method. It learns to sample negative examples without
relying on any heuristic schemes. Using six real hypergraphs, we show that AHP
generalizes better to negative examples of various natures. It yields up to
28.2% higher AUROC than best existing methods and often even outperforms its
variants with sampling schemes tailored to test sets.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Weak supervision (WS) is an alternative to the traditional supervised
learning to address the need for ground truth. Data programming is a practical
WS approach that allows programmatic labeling data samples using labeling
functions (LFs) instead of hand-labeling each data point. However, the existing
approach fails to fully exploit the domain knowledge encoded into LFs,
especially when the LFs' coverage is low. This is due to the common data
programming pipeline that neglects to utilize data features during the
generative process. This paper proposes a new approach called reinforced
labeling (RL). Given an unlabeled dataset and a set of LFs, RL augments the
LFs' outputs to cases not covered by LFs based on similarities among samples.
Thus, RL can lead to higher labeling coverage for training an end classifier.
The experiments on several domains (classification of YouTube comments, wine
quality, and weather prediction) result in considerable gains. The new approach
produces significant performance improvement, leading up to +21 points in
accuracy and +61 points in F1 scores compared to the state-of-the-art data
programming approach.]]></summary>

clinical trials in healthcare. Trial sites, where the trials are conducted, are
chosen mainly based on feasibility in terms of medical expertise and access to
a large group of patients. More recently, the issue of diversity and inclusion
in clinical trials is gaining importance. Different patient groups may
experience the effects of a medical drug/ treatment differently and hence need
to be included in the clinical trials. These groups could be based on
ethnicity, co-morbidities, age, or economic factors. Thus, designing a method
for trial site selection that accounts for both feasibility and diversity is a
crucial and urgent goal. In this paper, we formulate this problem as a ranking
problem with fairness constraints. Using principles of fairness in machine
learning, we learn a model that maps a clinical trial description to a ranked
list of potential trial sites. Unlike existing fairness frameworks, the group
membership of each trial site is non-binary: each trial site may have access to
patients from multiple groups. We propose fairness criteria based on
demographic parity to address such a multi-group membership scenario. We test
our method on 480 real-world clinical trials and show that our model results in
a list of potential trial sites that provides access to a diverse set of
patients while also ensuing a high number of enrolled patients.]]></summary>

constrained environments remains a challenging problem yet to be addressed,
while transfer learning from these models has become prevalent in Natural
Language Processing tasks. Several solutions, including knowledge distillation,
network quantization, or network pruning have been previously proposed;
however, these approaches focus mostly on the English language, thus widening
the gap when considering low-resource languages. In this work, we introduce
three light and fast versions of distilled BERT models for the Romanian
language: Distil-BERT-base-ro, Distil-RoBERT-base, and
DistilMulti-BERT-base-ro. The first two models resulted from the individual
distillation of knowledge from two base versions of Romanian BERTs available in
literature, while the last one was obtained by distilling their ensemble. To
our knowledge, this is the first attempt to create publicly available Romanian
distilled BERT models, which were thoroughly evaluated on five tasks:
part-of-speech tagging, named entity recognition, sentiment analysis, semantic
textual similarity, and dialect identification. Our experimental results argue
that the three distilled models offer performance comparable to their teachers,
while being twice as fast on a GPU and ~35% smaller. In addition, we further
test the similarity between the predictions of our students versus their
teachers by measuring their label and probability loyalty, together with
regression loyalty - a new metric introduced in this work.]]></summary>

evidently with the decreasing of spectral signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and there
are a huge amount of this kind observations, especially in case of SNR$<$30.
Therefore, it is helpful to improve the parameter estimation performance for
these spectra and this work studied the ($T_\texttt{eff}, \log~g$, [Fe/H])
estimation problem for LAMOST DR8 low-resolution spectra with 20$\leq$SNR$<$30.
We proposed a data-driven method based on machine learning techniques. Firstly,
this scheme detected stellar atmospheric parameter-sensitive features from
spectra by the Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO),
rejected ineffective data components and irrelevant data. Secondly, a
Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP) method was used to estimate stellar atmospheric
parameters from the LASSO features. Finally, the performance of the LASSO-MLP
was evaluated by computing and analyzing the consistency between its estimation
and the reference from the APOGEE (Apache Point Observatory Galactic Evolution
Experiment) high-resolution spectra. Experiments show that the Mean Absolute
Errors (MAE) of $T_\texttt{eff}, \log~g$, [Fe/H] are reduced from the LASP
(137.6 K, 0.195 dex, 0.091 dex) to LASSO-MLP (84.32 K, 0.137 dex, 0.063 dex),
which indicate evident improvements on stellar atmospheric parameter
estimation. In addition, this work estimated the stellar atmospheric parameters
for 1,162,760 low-resolution spectra with 20$\leq$SNR$<$30 from LAMOST DR8
using LASSO-MLP, and released the estimation catalog, learned model,

massive datasets exhibiting a possibly complex spatial dependence structure are
becoming increasingly available. In this context, the standard probabilistic
theory of statistical learning does not apply directly and guarantees of the
generalization capacity of predictive rules learned from such data are left to
establish. We analyze here the simple Kriging task, the flagship problem in
Geostatistics: the values of a square integrable random field $X=\{X_s\}_{s\in
S}$, $S\subset \mathbb{R}^2$, with unknown covariance structure are to be
predicted with minimum quadratic risk, based upon observing a single
realization of the spatial process at a finite number of locations $s_1,\;
\ldots,\; s_n$ in $S$. Despite the connection of this minimization problem with
kernel ridge regression, establishing the generalization capacity of empirical
risk minimizers is far from straightforward, due to the non i.i.d. nature of
the spatial data $X_{s_1},\; \ldots,\; X_{s_n}$ involved. In this article,
nonasymptotic bounds of order $O_{\mathbb{P}}(1/n)$ are proved for the excess
risk of a plug-in predictive rule mimicking the true minimizer in the case of
isotropic stationary Gaussian processes observed at locations forming a regular
grid. These theoretical results, as well as the role played by the technical
conditions required to establish them, are illustrated by various numerical
experiments and hopefully pave the way for further developments in statistical

particularly suitable for wireless learning scenarios since it can accomplish a
learning task without raw data transportation so as to preserve data privacy
and lower network resource consumption. However, current works on FL over
wireless networks do not profoundly study the fundamental performance of FL
over wireless networks that suffers from communication outage due to channel
impairment and network interference. To accurately exploit the performance of
FL over wireless networks, this paper proposes a novel intermittent FL model
over a cellular-connected unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) network, which
characterizes communication outage from UAV (clients) to their server and data
heterogeneity among the datasets at UAVs. We propose an analytically tractable
framework to derive the uplink outage probability and use it to devise a
simulation-based approach so as to evaluate the performance of the proposed
intermittent FL model. Our findings reveal how the intermittent FL model is
impacted by uplink communication outage and UAV deployment. Extensive numerical
simulations are provided to show the consistency between the simulated and
analytical performances of the proposed intermittent FL model.]]></summary>

tasks in the domains of computer vision and natural language processing, and
the existing frameworks such as TFF and FATE has made the deployment easy in
real-world applications. However, federated graph learning (FGL), even though
graph data are prevalent, has not been well supported due to its unique
characteristics and requirements. The lack of FGL-related framework increases
the efforts for accomplishing reproducible research and deploying in real-world
applications. Motivated by such strong demand, in this paper, we first discuss
the challenges in creating an easy-to-use FGL package and accordingly present
our implemented package FederatedScope-GNN (FS-G), which provides (1) a unified
view for modularizing and expressing FGL algorithms; (2) comprehensive DataZoo
and ModelZoo for out-of-the-box FGL capability; (3) an efficient model
auto-tuning component; and (4) off-the-shelf privacy attack and defense
abilities. We validate the effectiveness of FS-G by conducting extensive
experiments, which simultaneously gains many valuable insights about FGL for
the community. Moreover, we employ FS-G to serve the FGL application in
real-world E-commerce scenarios, where the attained improvements indicate great
potential business benefits. We publicly release FS-G, as submodules of
FederatedScope, at https://github.com/alibaba/FederatedScope to promote FGL's
research and enable broad applications that would otherwise be infeasible due
to the lack of a dedicated package.]]></summary>

but via multiple data views. For example, in genomic medicine, a patient can be
described by data from different molecular layers. This raises the need for
multi-view models that are able to disentangle variation within and across data
views in an interpretable manner. Latent variable models with structured
sparsity are a commonly used tool to address this modeling task but
interpretability is cumbersome since it requires a direct inspection and
interpretation of each factor via a specialized domain expert. Here, we propose
MuVI, a novel approach for domain-informed multi-view latent variable models,
facilitating the analysis of multi-view data in an inherently explainable
manner. We demonstrate that our model (i) is able to integrate noisy domain
expertise in form of feature sets, (ii) is robust to noise in the encoded
domain knowledge, (iii) results in identifiable factors and (iv) is able to
infer interpretable and biologically meaningful axes of variation in a
real-world multi-view dataset of cancer patients.]]></summary>

addressing data availability issues in various domains. Even more challenging
is the generation of synthetic time series data, where one has to preserve
temporal dynamics, i.e., the generated time series must respect the original
relationships between variables across time. Recently proposed techniques such
as generative adversarial networks (GANs) and quantum-GANs lack the ability to
attend to the time series specific temporal correlations adequately. We propose
using the inherent nature of quantum computers to simulate quantum dynamics as
a technique to encode such features. We start by assuming that a given time
series can be generated by a quantum process, after which we proceed to learn
that quantum process using quantum machine learning. We then use the learned
model to generate out-of-sample time series and show that it captures unique
and complex features of the learned time series. We also study the class of
time series that can be modeled using this technique. Finally, we
experimentally demonstrate the proposed algorithm on an 11-qubit trapped-ion
quantum machine.]]></summary>

neural networks, called variational autoencoder/generative adversarial network
(VAE/GAN), which can map input images to latent vectors and generate temporal

is reflected in the distance of the corresponding latent vector after training.
This indicates that the latent space is self-organized to reflect the proximity
structure of the dataset and may provide a mechanism through which many aspects
of cognition are spatially represented. The present study allows the network to
internally generate temporal sequences that are analogous to the hippocampal

approaches generate summaries that are not factually consistent with the source
document, severely restricting their trust and usage in real-world
applications. Recent works have shown promising improvements in factuality
error identification using text or dependency arc entailments; however, they do
not consider the entire semantic graph simultaneously. To this end, we propose
FactGraph, a method that decomposes the document and the summary into
structured meaning representations (MR), which are more suitable for factuality
evaluation. MRs describe core semantic concepts and their relations,
aggregating the main content in both document and summary in a canonical form,
and reducing data sparsity. FactGraph encodes such graphs using a graph encoder
augmented with structure-aware adapters to capture interactions among the
concepts based on the graph connectivity, along with text representations using
an adapter-based text encoder. Experiments on different benchmarks for
evaluating factuality show that FactGraph outperforms previous approaches by up
to 15%. Furthermore, FactGraph improves performance on identifying content
verifiability errors and better captures subsentence-level factual
inconsistencies.]]></summary>

models in each of its well-defined stages to manage credit risk. Application
scoring is used to decide whether to grant a credit or not, while behavioral
scoring is used mainly for portfolio management and to take preventive actions
in case of default signals. In both cases, network data has recently been shown
to be valuable to increase the predictive power of these models, especially
when the borrower's historical data is scarce or not available. This study aims
to understand the creditworthiness assessment performance dynamics and how it
is influenced by the credit history, repayment behavior, and social network
features. To accomplish this, we introduced a machine learning classification
framework to analyze 97.000 individuals and companies from the moment they
obtained their first loan to 12 months afterward. Our novel and massive dataset
allow us to characterize each borrower according to their credit behavior, and
social and economic relationships. Our research shows that borrowers' history
increases performance at a decreasing rate during the first six months and then
stabilizes. The most notable effect on perfomance of social networks features
occurs at loan application; in personal scoring, this effect prevails a few
months, while in business scoring adds value throughout the study period. These
findings are of great value to improve credit risk management and optimize the
use of traditional information and alternative data sources.]]></summary>

processing tasks. Supervised deep learning (DL) models give state-of-the-art
performance for single-channel speech dereverberation. Temporal convolutional
networks (TCNs) are commonly used for sequence modelling in speech enhancement
tasks. A feature of TCNs is that they have a receptive field (RF) dependant on
the specific model configuration which determines the number of input frames
that can be observed to produce an individual output frame. It has been shown
that TCNs are capable of performing dereverberation of simulated speech data,
however a thorough analysis, especially with focus on the RF is yet lacking in
the literature. This paper analyses dereverberation performance depending on
the model size and the RF of TCNs. Experiments using the WHAMR corpus which is
extended to include room impulse responses (RIRs) with larger T60 values
demonstrate that a larger RF can have significant improvement in performance
when training smaller TCN models. It is also demonstrated that TCNs benefit
from a wider RF when dereverberating RIRs with larger RT60 values.]]></summary>

solution for a specified task, even though diverse solutions often exist.
Recent studies showed that learning a set of diverse solutions is beneficial
because diversity enables robust few-shot adaptation. Although existing methods
learn diverse solutions by using the mutual information as unsupervised
rewards, such an approach often suffers from the bias of the gradient estimator
induced by value function approximation. In this study, we propose a novel
method that can learn diverse solutions without suffering the bias problem. In
our method, a policy conditioned on a continuous or discrete latent variable is
trained by directly maximizing the variational lower bound of the mutual
information, instead of using the mutual information as unsupervised rewards as
in previous studies. Through extensive experiments on robot locomotion tasks,
we demonstrate that the proposed method successfully learns an infinite set of
diverse solutions by learning continuous latent variables, which is more
challenging than learning a finite number of solutions. Subsequently, we show
that our method enables more effective few-shot adaptation compared with
existing methods.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Text-based communication is highly favoured as a communication method,
especially in business environments. As a result, it is often abused by sending
malicious messages, e.g., spam emails, to deceive users into relaying personal
information, including online accounts credentials or banking details. For this
reason, many machine learning methods for text classification have been
proposed and incorporated into the services of most email providers. However,
optimising text classification algorithms and finding the right tradeoff on
their aggressiveness is still a major research problem.

We present an updated survey of 12 machine learning text classifiers applied
to a public spam corpus. A new pipeline is proposed to optimise hyperparameter
selection and improve the models' performance by applying specific methods
(based on natural language processing) in the preprocessing stage.

Our study aims to provide a new methodology to investigate and optimise the
effect of different feature sizes and hyperparameters in machine learning
classifiers that are widely used in text classification problems. The
classifiers are tested and evaluated on different metrics including F-score
(accuracy), precision, recall, and run time. By analysing all these aspects, we
show how the proposed pipeline can be used to achieve a good accuracy towards
spam filtering on the Enron dataset, a widely used public email corpus.
Statistical tests and explainability techniques are applied to provide a robust
analysis of the proposed pipeline and interpret the classification outcomes of
the 12 machine learning models, also identifying words that drive the
classification results. Our analysis shows that it is possible to identify an
effective machine learning model to classify the Enron dataset with an F-score
of 94%.]]></summary>

present a practical framework from a model learning perspective. Based on
black-box model learning with scenario optimisation, we abstract the local
behaviour of a DNN via an affine model with the probably approximately correct
(PAC) guarantee. From the learned model, we can infer the corresponding
PAC-model robustness property. The innovation of our work is the integration of
model learning into PAC robustness analysis: that is, we construct a PAC
guarantee on the model level instead of sample distribution, which induces a
more faithful and accurate robustness evaluation. This is in contrast to
existing statistical methods without model learning. We implement our method in
a prototypical tool named DeepPAC. As a black-box method, DeepPAC is scalable
and efficient, especially when DNNs have complex structures or high-dimensional
inputs. We extensively evaluate DeepPAC, with 4 baselines (using formal
verification, statistical methods, testing and adversarial attack) and 20 DNN
models across 3 datasets, including MNIST, CIFAR-10, and ImageNet. It is shown
that DeepPAC outperforms the state-of-the-art statistical method PROVERO, and
it achieves more practical robustness analysis than the formal verification
tool ERAN. Also, its results are consistent with existing DNN testing work like
DeepGini.]]></summary>

conventional artificial neural networks (ANN) thanks to their temporal
processing capabilities and energy efficient implementations in neuromorphic
hardware. However the challenges involved in training SNNs have limited their
performance in terms of accuracy and thus their applications. Improving
learning algorithms and neural architectures for a more accurate feature
extraction is therefore one of the current priorities in SNN research. In this
paper we present a study on the key components of modern spiking architectures.
We empirically compare different techniques in image classification datasets
taken from the best performing networks. We design a spiking version of the
successful residual network architecture and provide an in-depth study on the
possible implementations of spiking residual connections. Our results provide a
state of the art guide to SNN design, which allows to make informed choices
when trying to build the optimal visual feature extractor. Finally, our network
outperforms previous SNN architectures in CIFAR-10 (94.14%) and CIFAR-100
(74.65%) datasets and matches the state of the art in DVS-CIFAR10 (72.98%),
with less parameters than the previous state of the art and without the need
for ANN-SNN conversion. Code available at

such as Bitcoin, for money laundering. The use of cryptocurrencies can hide
criminal identities and transfer hundreds of millions of dollars of dirty funds
through their criminal digital wallets. However, this is considered a paradox
because cryptocurrencies are gold mines for open-source intelligence, allowing
law enforcement agencies to have more power in conducting forensic analyses.
This paper proposed Inspection-L, a graph neural network (GNN) framework based
on self-supervised Deep Graph Infomax (DGI), with supervised learning
algorithms, namely Random Forest (RF) to detect illicit transactions for AML.
To the best of our knowledge, our proposal is the first of applying
self-supervised GNNs to the problem of AML in Bitcoin. The proposed method has
been evaluated on the Elliptic dataset and shows that our approach outperforms
the baseline in terms of key classification metrics, which demonstrates the
potential of self-supervised GNN in cryptocurrency illicit transaction
detection.]]></summary>

predict protein-ligand binding. These models are of great value to medicinal
chemists, in particular if they provide case-specific insight into the physical
interactions that drive the binding process. In this study we derive ML models
from over 50 fragment-screening campaigns to introduce two important elements
that we believe are absent in most -- if not all -- ML studies of this type
reported to date: First, alongside the observed hits we use to train our
models, we incorporate true misses and show that these experimentally validated
negative data are of significant importance to the quality of the derived
models. Second, we provide a physically interpretable and verifiable
representation of what the ML model considers important for successful binding.
This representation is derived from a straightforward attribution procedure
that explains the prediction in terms of the (inter-)action of chemical
environments. Critically, we validate the attribution outcome on a large scale
against prior annotations made independently by expert molecular modellers. We
find good agreement between the key molecular substructures proposed by the ML
model and those assigned manually, even when the model's performance in
discriminating hits from misses is far from perfect. By projecting the
attribution onto predefined interaction prototypes (pharmacophores), we show
that ML allows us to formulate simple rules for what drives fragment binding
against a target automatically from screening data.]]></summary>

great deal of attention because of their applicability to a wide range of
machine learning problems. Although significant progress has been made
recently, the literature to date has focused on games with independent strategy
sets; little is known about solving games with dependent strategy sets, which
can be characterized as min-max Stackelberg games. We introduce two first-order
methods that solve a large class of convex-concave min-max Stackelberg games,
and show that our methods converge in polynomial time. Min-max Stackelberg
games were first studied by Wald, under the posthumous name of Wald's maximin
model, a variant of which is the main paradigm used in robust optimization,
which means that our methods can likewise solve many convex robust optimization
problems. We observe that the computation of competitive equilibria in Fisher
markets also comprises a min-max Stackelberg game. Further, we demonstrate the
efficacy and efficiency of our algorithms in practice by computing competitive
equilibria in Fisher markets with varying utility structures. Our experiments
suggest potential ways to extend our theoretical results, by demonstrating how
different smoothness properties can affect the convergence rate of our
algorithms.]]></summary>

vulnerabilities and brittleness become a pressing concern. Adversarial attacks
are a popular framework for studying these vulnerabilities. In this work, we
study the error of linear regression in the face of adversarial attacks. We
provide bounds of the error in terms of the traditional risk and the parameter
norm and show how these bounds can be leveraged and make it possible to use
analysis from non-adversarial setups to study the adversarial risk. The
usefulness of these results is illustrated by shedding light on whether or not
overparameterized linear models can be adversarially robust. We show that
adding features to linear models might be either a source of additional
robustness or brittleness. We show that these differences appear due to scaling
and how the $\ell_1$ and $\ell_2$ norms of random projections concentrate. We
also show how the reformulation we propose allows for solving adversarial
training as a convex optimization problem. This is then used as a tool to study
how adversarial training and other regularization methods might affect the

intelligent agent should be prepared to anticipate a change in its belief of
the environment state, and be capable of adapting its actions on-the-fly to
changing conditions. As humans, we are able to form contingency plans when
learning a task with the explicit aim of being able to correct errors in the
initial control, and hence prove useful if ever there is a sudden change in our
perception of the environment which requires immediate corrective action. This
is especially the case for autonomous vehicles (AVs) navigating real-world
situations where safety is paramount, and a strong ability to react to a
changing belief about the environment is truly needed.

In this paper we explore an end-to-end approach, from training to execution,
for learning robust contingency plans and combining them with a hierarchical
planner to obtain a robust agent policy in an autonomous navigation task where
other vehicles' behaviours are unknown, and the agent's belief about these
behaviours is subject to sudden, last-second change. We show that our approach
results in robust, safe behaviour in a partially observable, stochastic
environment, generalizing well over environment dynamics not seen during
training.]]></summary>

We further prove that the metric controls the convergence rate, particularly in
settings where the heterogeneity across nodes dominates the stochasticity
between updates for a given node. Motivated by our analysis, we propose an

learning. Since designing and training expressive Lipschitz-constrained
networks is very challenging, there is a need for improved methods and a better
theoretical understanding. Unfortunately, it turns out that ReLU networks have
provable disadvantages in this setting. Hence, we propose to use learnable
spline activation functions with at least 3 linear regions instead. We prove
that this choice is optimal among all component-wise $1$-Lipschitz activation
functions in the sense that no other weight constrained architecture can
approximate a larger class of functions. Additionally, this choice is at least

learning models in the open world. Distance-based methods have demonstrated
promise, where testing samples are detected as OOD if they are relatively far
away from in-distribution (ID) data. However, prior methods impose a strong
distributional assumption of the underlying feature space, which may not always
hold. In this paper, we explore the efficacy of non-parametric nearest-neighbor
distance for OOD detection, which has been largely overlooked in the
literature. Unlike prior works, our method does not impose any distributional
assumption, hence providing stronger flexibility and generality. We demonstrate
the effectiveness of nearest-neighbor-based OOD detection on several benchmarks
and establish superior performance. Under the same model trained on
ImageNet-1k, our method substantially reduces the false positive rate
(FPR@TPR95) by 24.77% compared to a strong baseline SSD+, which uses a
parametric approach Mahalanobis distance in detection.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Efficient anomaly detection and diagnosis in multivariate time-series data is
of great importance for modern industrial applications. However, building a
system that is able to quickly and accurately pinpoint anomalous observations
is a challenging problem. This is due to the lack of anomaly labels, high data
volatility and the demands of ultra-low inference times in modern applications.
Despite the recent developments of deep learning approaches for anomaly
detection, only a few of them can address all of these challenges. In this
paper, we propose TranAD, a deep transformer network based anomaly detection
and diagnosis model which uses attention-based sequence encoders to swiftly
perform inference with the knowledge of the broader temporal trends in the
data. TranAD uses focus score-based self-conditioning to enable robust
multi-modal feature extraction and adversarial training to gain stability.
Additionally, model-agnostic meta learning (MAML) allows us to train the model
using limited data. Extensive empirical studies on six publicly available
datasets demonstrate that TranAD can outperform state-of-the-art baseline
methods in detection and diagnosis performance with data and time-efficient
training. Specifically, TranAD increases F1 scores by up to 17%, reducing
training times by up to 99% compared to the baselines.]]></summary>

the common network threats nowadays have the characteristics of varieties and

will result in low classification performance on attack behaviors of small

efficiently, using Adaptive Synthetic Sampling (ADASYN) method to balance
datasets was proposed in this paper. In addition, Random Forest algorithm was
used to train intrusion detection classifiers. Through the comparative
experiment of Intrusion detection on CICIDS 2017 dataset, it is found that
ADASYN with Random Forest performs better. Based on the experimental results,
the improvement of precision, recall, F1 scores and AUC values after ADASYN is
then analyzed. Experiments show that the proposed method can be applied to
intrusion detection with large data, and can effectively improve the

in real-world applications. Many studies improve sample efficiency by extending
adversarial imitation to be off-policy regardless of the fact that these
off-policy extensions could either change the original objective or involve
complicated optimization. We revisit the foundation of adversarial imitation
and propose an off-policy sample efficient approach that requires no
adversarial training or min-max optimization. Our formulation capitalizes on
two key insights: (1) the similarity between the Bellman equation and the
stationary state-action distribution equation allows us to derive a novel
temporal difference (TD) learning approach; and (2) the use of a deterministic
policy simplifies the TD learning. Combined, these insights yield a practical
algorithm, Deterministic and Discriminative Imitation (D2-Imitation), which
operates by first partitioning samples into two replay buffers and then
learning a deterministic policy via off-policy reinforcement learning. Our
empirical results show that D2-Imitation is effective in achieving good sample
efficiency, outperforming several off-policy extension approaches of
adversarial imitation on many control tasks.]]></summary>

theoretical and practical challenges for learning accurate preferences from
rich behavior data. Among existing user behavior modeling solutions, attention
networks are widely adopted for its effectiveness and relative simplicity.
Despite being extensively studied, existing attentions still suffer from two
limitations: i) conventional attentions mainly take into account the spatial
correlation between user behaviors, regardless the distance between those
behaviors in the continuous time space; and ii) these attentions mostly provide
a dense and undistinguished distribution over all past behaviors then
attentively encode them into the output latent representations. This is however
not suitable in practical scenarios where a user's future actions are relevant
to a small subset of her/his historical behaviors. In this paper, we propose a
novel attention network, named self-modulating attention, that models the
complex and non-linearly evolving dynamic user preferences. We empirically
demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on top-N sequential recommendation
tasks, and the results on three large-scale real-world datasets show that our

having encountered many applications in Structural Dynamics and Vibroacoustic
(SD\&V). The increasing capabilities of ML to unveil insights from data, driven
by unprecedented data availability, algorithms advances and computational
power, enhance decision making, uncertainty handling, patterns recognition and
real-time assessments. Three main applications in SD\&V have taken advantage of
these benefits. In Structural Health Monitoring, ML detection and prognosis
lead to safe operation and optimized maintenance schedules. System
identification and control design are leveraged by ML techniques in Active
Noise Control and Active Vibration Control. Finally, the so-called ML-based
surrogate models provide fast alternatives to costly simulations, enabling
robust and optimized product design. Despite the many works in the area, they
have not been reviewed and analyzed. Therefore, to keep track and understand
this ongoing integration of fields, this paper presents a survey of ML
applications in SD\&V analyses, shedding light on the current state of
implementation and emerging opportunities. The main methodologies, advantages,
limitations, and recommendations based on scientific knowledge were identified
for each of the three applications. Moreover, the paper considers the role of
Digital Twins and Physics Guided ML to overcome current challenges and power

learning models with data distributed over arbitrary communication graphs.
However, most existing approaches toward decentralized learning disregard the
interaction between data heterogeneity and graph topology. In this paper, we
characterize the dependence of convergence on the relationship between the
mixing weights of the graph and the data heterogeneity across nodes. We propose
a metric that quantifies the ability of a graph to mix the current gradients.
We further prove that the metric controls the convergence rate, particularly in
settings where the heterogeneity across nodes dominates the stochasticity
between updates for a given node. Motivated by our analysis, we propose an
approach that periodically and efficiently optimizes the metric using standard
convex constrained optimization and sketching techniques. Through comprehensive
experiments on standard computer vision and NLP benchmarks, we show that our
approach leads to improvement in test performance for a wide range of tasks.]]></summary>

and time series types can progress our understanding and modelling ability of
the Earth's hydroclimate and its dynamics. As a step towards these important
directions, we here propose and extensively apply a multifaceted and
engineering-friendly methodological framework for the thorough characterization
of seasonal hydroclimatic dependence, variability and change at the global
scale. We apply this framework using over 13 000 quarterly temperature,
precipitation and river flow time series. In these time series, the seasonal
hydroclimatic behaviour is represented by 3-month means of earth-observed
variables. In our analyses, we also adopt the well-established Koppen-Geiger
climate classification system and define continental-scale regions with large
or medium density of observational stations. In this context, we provide in
parallel seasonal hydroclimatic feature summaries and comparisons in terms of
autocorrelation, seasonality, temporal variation, entropy, long-range
dependence and trends. We find notable differences to characterize the
magnitudes of most of these features across the various Koppen-Geiger climate
classes, as well as between several continental-scale geographical regions. We,
therefore, deem that the consideration of the comparative summaries could be
more beneficial in water resources engineering contexts than the also provided
global summaries. Lastly, we apply explainable machine learning to compare the
investigated features with respect to how informative they are in explaining
and predicting either the main Koppen-Geiger climate or the continental-scale
region, with the entropy, long-range dependence and trend features being
(roughly) found to be less informative than the remaining ones at the seasonal
time scale.]]></summary>

massive datasets exhibiting a possibly complex spatial dependence structure are
becoming increasingly available. In this context, the standard probabilistic
theory of statistical learning does not apply directly and guarantees of the
generalization capacity of predictive rules learned from such data are left to
establish. We analyze here the simple Kriging task, the flagship problem in
Geostatistics: the values of a square integrable random field $X=\{X_s\}_{s\in
S}$, $S\subset \mathbb{R}^2$, with unknown covariance structure are to be
predicted with minimum quadratic risk, based upon observing a single
realization of the spatial process at a finite number of locations $s_1,\;
\ldots,\; s_n$ in $S$. Despite the connection of this minimization problem with
kernel ridge regression, establishing the generalization capacity of empirical
risk minimizers is far from straightforward, due to the non i.i.d. nature of
the spatial data $X_{s_1},\; \ldots,\; X_{s_n}$ involved. In this article,
nonasymptotic bounds of order $O_{\mathbb{P}}(1/n)$ are proved for the excess
risk of a plug-in predictive rule mimicking the true minimizer in the case of
isotropic stationary Gaussian processes observed at locations forming a regular
grid. These theoretical results, as well as the role played by the technical
conditions required to establish them, are illustrated by various numerical
experiments and hopefully pave the way for further developments in statistical
learning based on spatial data.]]></summary>

anisotropic models -- in which messages sent between nodes are a function of
both the source and target node -- are required to achieve state-of-the-art
performance. Benchmarks to date have demonstrated that these models perform
better than comparable isotropic models -- where messages are a function of the
source node only. In this work we provide empirical evidence challenging this
narrative: we propose an isotropic GNN, which we call Efficient Graph
Convolution (EGC), that consistently outperforms comparable anisotropic models,
including the popular GAT or PNA architectures by using spatially-varying
adaptive filters. In addition to raising important questions for the GNN
community, our work has significant real-world implications for efficiency. EGC
achieves higher model accuracy, with lower memory consumption and latency,
along with characteristics suited to accelerator implementation, while being a
drop-in replacement for existing architectures. As an isotropic model, it
requires memory proportional to the number of vertices in the graph
($\mathcal{O}(V)$); in contrast, anisotropic models require memory proportional
to the number of edges ($\mathcal{O}(E)$). We demonstrate that EGC outperforms
existing approaches across 6 large and diverse benchmark datasets, and conclude
by discussing questions that our work raise for the community going forward.

present a practical framework from a model learning perspective. Based on
black-box model learning with scenario optimisation, we abstract the local
behaviour of a DNN via an affine model with the probably approximately correct
(PAC) guarantee. From the learned model, we can infer the corresponding
PAC-model robustness property. The innovation of our work is the integration of
model learning into PAC robustness analysis: that is, we construct a PAC
guarantee on the model level instead of sample distribution, which induces a
more faithful and accurate robustness evaluation. This is in contrast to
existing statistical methods without model learning. We implement our method in
a prototypical tool named DeepPAC. As a black-box method, DeepPAC is scalable
and efficient, especially when DNNs have complex structures or high-dimensional
inputs. We extensively evaluate DeepPAC, with 4 baselines (using formal
verification, statistical methods, testing and adversarial attack) and 20 DNN
models across 3 datasets, including MNIST, CIFAR-10, and ImageNet. It is shown
that DeepPAC outperforms the state-of-the-art statistical method PROVERO, and
it achieves more practical robustness analysis than the formal verification

method to determine the probability of failure. This method, however, requires
a large number of numerical simulations demanding high computational costs.
This paper explores the efficiency of different machine learning (ML)
algorithms used as surrogate models trained on a limited number of random field
slope stability simulations in predicting the results of large datasets. The MC
data in this paper require only the examination of failure or non-failure,
circumventing the time-consuming calculation of factors of safety. An extensive
dataset is generated, consisting of 120,000 finite difference MC slope
stability simulations incorporating different levels of soil heterogeneity and
anisotropy. The Bagging Ensemble, Random Forest and Support Vector classifiers
are found to be the superior models for this problem amongst 9 different models
and ensemble classifiers. Trained only on 0.47% of data (500 samples), the ML
model can classify the entire 120,000 samples with an accuracy of %85 and AUC
score of %91. The performance of ML methods in classifying the random field
slope stability results generally reduces with higher anisotropy and
heterogeneity of soil. The ML assisted MC reliability analysis proves a robust
stochastic method where errors in the predicted probability of failure using %5
of MC data is only %0.46 in average. The approach reduced the computational

provide bounds of the error in terms of the traditional risk and the parameter

overparameterized linear models can be adversarially robust. We show that
adding features to linear models might be either a source of additional
robustness or brittleness. We show that these differences appear due to scaling
and how the $\ell_1$ and $\ell_2$ norms of random projections concentrate. We

multicollinearity among variables cannot be effectively solved. In this paper,
the proposed model can choose the most relevant variables by solving a joint

data-driven speech processing methods, a major challenge for speech data
scientists in the healthcare domain is the anonymization of pathological
speech, which is a required step to be able to make them accessible as a public
training resource. In this paper, we investigate pathological speech data and
compare their speaker verifiability with that of healthy individuals. We
utilize a large pathological speech corpus of more than 2,000 test subjects
with various speech and voice disorders from different ages and apply DL-based
automatic speaker verification (ASV) techniques. As a result, we obtained a
mean equal error rate (EER) of 0.86% with a standard deviation of 0.16%, which
is a factor of three lower than comparable healthy speech databases. We further
perform detailed analyses of external influencing factors on ASV such as age,
pathology, recording environment, and utterance length, to explore their
respective effect. Our findings indicate that speech pathology is a potential
biomarker in ASV. This is potentially of high interest for the anonymization of
pathological speech data.]]></summary>

know what it knows and, also, what it does not know. This capability relies on
the quality of \textit{joint} predictions of labels assigned to multiple
inputs. Conventional neural networks lack this capability and, since most
research has focused on marginal predictions, this shortcoming has been largely
overlooked. By assessing the quality of joint predictions it is possible to
determine whether a neural network effectively distinguishes between epistemic
uncertainty (that due to lack of knowledge) and aleatoric uncertainty (that due
to chance). We introduce the \textit{epistemic neural network} (ENN) as a
general interface for uncertainty modeling in deep learning. While prior
approaches to uncertainty modeling can be viewed as ENNs, the new interface
facilitates comparison of joint predictions, and the design of novel
architectures and algorithms. In particular, we introduce the \textit{epinet}:
an architecture that can supplement any existing neural network, including
pretrained models, and trained with modest incremental computation to represent
uncertainty. With an epinet, conventional neural networks outperform very large
ensembles, consisting of hundreds or more particles, with orders of magnitude
less computation. We demonstrate this efficacy across synthetic data, ImageNet,

will click on the recommended item. As mind-boggling amounts of data are
produced online daily, accelerating CTR prediction model training is critical
to ensuring an up-to-date model and reducing the training cost. One approach to
increase the training speed is to apply large batch training. However, as shown
in computer vision and natural language processing tasks, training with a large
batch easily suffers from the loss of accuracy. Our experiments show that
previous scaling rules fail in the training of CTR prediction neural networks.
To tackle this problem, we first theoretically show that different frequencies
of ids make it challenging to scale hyperparameters when scaling the batch
size. To stabilize the training process in a large batch size setting, we
develop the adaptive Column-wise Clipping (CowClip). It enables an easy and
effective scaling rule for the embeddings, which keeps the learning rate
unchanged and scales the L2 loss. We conduct extensive experiments with four
CTR prediction networks on two real-world datasets and successfully scaled 128
times the original batch size without accuracy loss. In particular, for CTR
prediction model DeepFM training on the Criteo dataset, our optimization
framework enlarges the batch size from 1K to 128K with over 0.1% AUC
improvement and reduces training time from 12 hours to 10 minutes on a single

the original network, using a mechanism based on centrality metrics such as
PageRank. Our results on eight large networks (including two with $\sim$50k

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Polynomial chaos expansion (PCE) is a versatile tool widely used in
uncertainty quantification and machine learning, but its successful application
depends strongly on the accuracy and reliability of the resulting PCE-based
response surface. High accuracy typically requires high polynomial degrees,
demanding many training points especially in high-dimensional problems through
the curse of dimensionality. So-called sparse PCE concepts work with a much
smaller selection of basis polynomials compared to conventional PCE approaches
and can overcome the curse of dimensionality very efficiently, but have to pay
specific attention to their strategies of choosing training points.
Furthermore, the approximation error resembles an uncertainty that most
existing PCE-based methods do not estimate. In this study, we develop and
evaluate a fully Bayesian approach to establish the PCE representation via
joint shrinkage priors and Markov chain Monte Carlo. The suggested Bayesian PCE
model directly aims to solve the two challenges named above: achieving a sparse
PCE representation and estimating uncertainty of the PCE itself. The embedded
Bayesian regularizing via the joint shrinkage prior allows using higher
polynomial degrees for given training points due to its ability to handle
underdetermined situations, where the number of considered PCE coefficients
could be much larger than the number of available training points. We also
explore multiple variable selection methods to construct sparse PCE expansions
based on the established Bayesian representations, while globally selecting the
most meaningful orthonormal polynomials given the available training data. We
demonstrate the advantages of our Bayesian PCE and the corresponding
sparsity-inducing methods on several benchmarks.]]></summary>

using the inherent nature of quantum computers to simulate quantum dynamics as
a technique to encode such features. We start by assuming that a given time

that quantum process using quantum machine learning. We then use the learned
model to generate out-of-sample time series and show that it captures unique
and complex features of the learned time series. We also study the class of
time series that can be modeled using this technique. Finally, we

between vertices and hyperedges in an end-to-end manner and thus the task-aware
hypergraph is learned. Furthermore, HERALD employs the self-attention mechanism
to capture the non-local paired-nodes relation. Extensive experiments on

logistic regression. Unlike binary classification, in the multiclass setup one
can think about an entire spectrum of possible notions of sparsity associated

penalized maximum likelihood with convex penalties capturing a specific type of
sparsity at hand. In particular, we consider global sparsity, double row-wise
sparsity, and low-rank sparsity, and show that with the properly chosen tuning

know what it knows and, also, what it does not know. This capability relies on
the quality of \textit{joint} predictions of labels assigned to multiple
inputs. Conventional neural networks lack this capability and, since most
research has focused on marginal predictions, this shortcoming has been largely
overlooked. By assessing the quality of joint predictions it is possible to
determine whether a neural network effectively distinguishes between epistemic
uncertainty (that due to lack of knowledge) and aleatoric uncertainty (that due
to chance). We introduce the \textit{epistemic neural network} (ENN) as a
general interface for uncertainty modeling in deep learning. While prior
approaches to uncertainty modeling can be viewed as ENNs, the new interface
facilitates comparison of joint predictions, and the design of novel
architectures and algorithms. In particular, we introduce the \textit{epinet}:
an architecture that can supplement any existing neural network, including
pretrained models, and trained with modest incremental computation to represent
uncertainty. With an epinet, conventional neural networks outperform very large
ensembles, consisting of hundreds or more particles, with orders of magnitude
less computation. We demonstrate this efficacy across synthetic data, ImageNet,
and sequential decision problems. As part of this effort we open-source
experiment code.]]></summary>

simulator-based models whose likelihoods are difficult to calculate but easy to
simulate from. ABC constructs a kernel-type approximation to the posterior
distribution through an accept/reject mechanism which compares summary
statistics of real and simulated data. To obviate the need for summary
statistics, we directly compare empirical distributions with a Kullback-Leibler
(KL) divergence estimator obtained via contrastive learning. In particular, we
blend flexible machine learning classifiers within ABC to automate fake/real
data comparisons. We consider the traditional accept/reject kernel as well as
an exponential weighting scheme which does not require the ABC acceptance
threshold. Our theoretical results show that the rate at which our ABC
posterior distributions concentrate around the true parameter depends on the
estimation error of the classifier. We derive limiting posterior shape results
and find that, with a properly scaled exponential kernel, asymptotic normality
holds. We demonstrate the usefulness of our approach on simulated examples as

solution for a specified task, even though diverse solutions often exist.
Recent studies showed that learning a set of diverse solutions is beneficial
because diversity enables robust few-shot adaptation. Although existing methods
learn diverse solutions by using the mutual information as unsupervised
rewards, such an approach often suffers from the bias of the gradient estimator
induced by value function approximation. In this study, we propose a novel
method that can learn diverse solutions without suffering the bias problem. In
our method, a policy conditioned on a continuous or discrete latent variable is
trained by directly maximizing the variational lower bound of the mutual
information, instead of using the mutual information as unsupervised rewards as
in previous studies. Through extensive experiments on robot locomotion tasks,
we demonstrate that the proposed method successfully learns an infinite set of
diverse solutions by learning continuous latent variables, which is more
challenging than learning a finite number of solutions. Subsequently, we show
that our method enables more effective few-shot adaptation compared with
existing methods.]]></summary>

the central limit theorem (CLT). Our methods take the form of confidence
sequences (CS) -- sequences of confidence intervals that are uniformly valid
over time. CSs provide valid inference at arbitrary stopping times, incurring
no penalties for "peeking" at the data, unlike classical confidence intervals
which require the sample size to be fixed in advance. Existing CSs in the
literature are nonasymptotic, requiring strong assumptions on the data, while
the classical (fixed-time) CLT is ubiquitous due to the weak assumptions it
imposes. Our work bridges the gap by introducing time-uniform CSs that only
require CLT-like assumptions. While the CLT approximates the distribution of a
sample average by that of a Gaussian at a fixed sample size, we use strong
invariance principles like the seminal work of Koml\'os, Major, and Tusn\'ady
to uniformly approximate the entire sample average process by an implicit
Brownian motion. Applying Robbins' normal mixture martingale method to this
Brownian motion then yields closed-form time-uniform boundaries. We combine
these boundaries with doubly robust estimators to derive nonparametric CSs for
the average treatment effect (and other causal estimands). These allow
randomized experiments and observational studies to be continuously monitored
and adaptively stopped, all while controlling the type-I error.]]></summary>

varying complexity. Furthermore, 12 pooling functions for combining multiple
predictions were analyzed, ranging from simple statistical functions like
unweighted averaging up to more complex learning-based functions like support
vector machines. Our results revealed that Stacking achieved the largest
performance gain of up to 13% F1-score increase. Augmenting showed consistent
improvement capabilities by up to 4% and is also applicable to single model

performance gain close to Stacking, which resulted in an F1-score increase up

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The demand of probabilistic time series forecasting has been recently raised
in various dynamic system scenarios, for example, system identification and
prognostic and health management of machines. To this end, we combine the
advances in both deep generative models and state space model (SSM) to come up
with a novel, data-driven deep probabilistic sequence model. Specifically, we
follow the popular encoder-decoder generative structure to build the recurrent
neural networks (RNN) assisted variational sequence model on an augmented
recurrent input space, which could induce rich stochastic sequence dependency.
Besides, in order to alleviate the inconsistency issue of the posterior between
training and predicting as well as improving the mining of dynamic patterns, we
(i) propose using a lagged hybrid output as input for the posterior at next
time step, which brings training and predicting into alignment; and (ii)
further devise a generalized auto-regressive strategy that encodes all the
historical dependencies for the posterior. Thereafter, we first investigate the
methodological characteristics of the proposed deep probabilistic sequence
model on toy cases, and then comprehensively demonstrate the superiority of our
model against existing deep probabilistic SSM models through extensive

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Next Point-of-Interest (POI) recommendation has become an indispensable
functionality in Location-based Social Networks (LBSNs) due to its
effectiveness in helping people decide the next POI to visit. However, accurate
recommendation requires a vast amount of historical check-in data, thus
threatening user privacy as the location-sensitive data needs to be handled by
cloud servers. Although there have been several on-device frameworks for
privacy-preserving POI recommendations, they are still resource-intensive when
it comes to storage and computation, and show limited robustness to the high
sparsity of user-POI interactions. On this basis, we propose a novel
decentralized collaborative learning framework for POI recommendation (DCLR),
which allows users to train their personalized models locally in a
collaborative manner. DCLR significantly reduces the local models' dependence
on the cloud for training, and can be used to expand arbitrary centralized
recommendation models. To counteract the sparsity of on-device user data when
learning each local model, we design two self-supervision signals to pretrain
the POI representations on the server with geographical and categorical
correlations of POIs. To facilitate collaborative learning, we innovatively
propose to incorporate knowledge from either geographically or semantically
similar users into each local model with attentive aggregation and mutual
information maximization. The collaborative learning process makes use of
communications between devices while requiring only minor engagement from the
central server for identifying user groups, and is compatible with common
privacy preservation mechanisms like differential privacy.]]></summary>

well training a recommendation model. We argue that a high-quality negative
should be both \textit{informativeness} and \textit{unbiasedness}. Although
previous studies have proposed some approaches to address the informativeness
in negative sampling, few has been done to discriminating false negative from
true negative for unbiased negative sampling, not to mention taking both into
consideration. This paper first adopts a parameter learning perspective to
analyze negative informativeness and unbiasedness in loss gradient-based model
training. We argue that both negative sampling and collaborative filtering
include an implicit task of negative classification, from which we report an
insightful yet beneficial finding about the order relation in predicted
negatives' scores. Based on our finding and by regarding negatives as random
variables, we next derive the class condition density of true negatives and
that of false negatives. We also design a Bayesian classifier for negative
classification, from which we define a quantitative unbiasedness measure for
negatives. Finally, we propose to use a harmonic mean of informativeness and
unbiasedness to sample high-quality negatives. Experimental studies validate
the superiority of our negative sampling algorithm over the peers in terms of
better sampling quality and better recommendation performance.]]></summary>

proposed for the coverage and capacity optimization of simultaneously

proposed. In this algorithm, a loss function-based update strategy is the core

closed information extraction, the problem of extracting an exhaustive set of
(subject, relation, object) triplets that are consistent with a predefined set
of entities and relations from a knowledge base schema. Most existing works are
pipelines prone to error accumulation, and all approaches are only applicable
to unrealistically small numbers of entities and relations. We introduce GenIE
(generative information extraction), the first end-to-end autoregressive
formulation of closed information extraction. GenIE naturally exploits the
language knowledge from the pre-trained transformer by autoregressively
generating relations and entities in textual form. Thanks to a new bi-level
constrained generation strategy, only triplets consistent with the predefined
knowledge base schema are produced. Our experiments show that GenIE is
state-of-the-art on closed information extraction, generalizes from fewer
training data points than baselines, and scales to a previously unmanageable
number of entities and relations. With this work, closed information extraction
becomes practical in realistic scenarios, providing new opportunities for
downstream tasks. Finally, this work paves the way towards a unified end-to-end
approach to the core tasks of information extraction. Code, data and models

scaling parameters, based on which we design a novel regularisation term that
suppresses only neurons with low importance. Under our method, the weights of
unnecessary neurons effectively recede, producing a polarised bimodal

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Named Entity Recognition (NER) is a basic NLP task and finds major
applications in conversational and search systems. It helps us identify key
entities in a sentence used for the downstream application. NER or similar slot
filling systems for popular languages have been heavily used in commercial
applications. In this work, we focus on Marathi, an Indian language, spoken
prominently by the people of Maharashtra state. Marathi is a low resource
language and still lacks useful NER resources. We present L3Cube-MahaNER, the
first major gold standard named entity recognition dataset in Marathi. We also
describe the manual annotation guidelines followed during the process. In the
end, we benchmark the dataset on different CNN, LSTM, and Transformer based
models like mBERT, XLM-RoBERTa, IndicBERT, MahaBERT, etc. The MahaBERT provides
the best performance among all the models. The data and models are available at

big data solutions. However it must be stressed, that significant number of
applications for machine learning in insurance industry, like fraud detection
or claim prediction, deals with the problem of machine learning on an
imbalanced data set. This is due to the fact that frauds or claims are rare
events when compared with the entire population of drivers. The problem of
imbalanced learning is often hard to overcome. Therefore, the main goal of this
work is to present and apply various methods of dealing with an imbalanced
dataset in the context of claim occurrence prediction in car insurance. In
addition, the above techniques are used to compare the results of machine
learning algorithms in the context of claim occurrence prediction in car
insurance. Our study covers the following techniques: logistic-regression,
decision tree, random forest, xgBoost, feed-forward network. The problem is the
classification one.]]></summary>

However, deep learning models are not fully capable of exploiting visual and
contextual information simultaneously. The proposed three-layer context-based
deep architecture is capable of integrating context explicitly with visual
information. The novel idea here is to have a visual layer to learn visual
characteristics from binary class-based learners, a contextual layer to learn
context, and then an integration layer to learn from both via genetic
algorithm-based optimal fusion to produce a final decision. The experimental
outcomes when evaluated on benchmark datasets are promising. Further analysis
shows that optimized network weights can improve performance and make stable

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Many software systems today face uncertain operating conditions, such as
sudden changes in the availability of resources or unexpected user behavior.
Without proper mitigation these uncertainties can jeopardize the system goals.
Self-adaptation is a common approach to tackle such uncertainties. When the
system goals may be compromised, the self-adaptive system has to select the
best adaptation option to reconfigure by analyzing the possible adaptation
options, i.e., the adaptation space. Yet, analyzing large adaptation spaces
using rigorous methods can be resource- and time-consuming, or even be
infeasible. One approach to tackle this problem is by using online machine
learning to reduce adaptation spaces. However, existing approaches require
domain expertise to perform feature engineering to define the learner, and
support online adaptation space reduction only for specific goals. To tackle
these limitations, we present 'Deep Learning for Adaptation Space Reduction
Plus' -- DLASeR+ in short. DLASeR+ offers an extendable learning framework for
online adaptation space reduction that does not require feature engineering,
while supporting three common types of adaptation goals: threshold,
optimization, and set-point goals. We evaluate DLASeR+ on two instances of an
Internet-of-Things application with increasing sizes of adaptation spaces for
different combinations of adaptation goals. We compare DLASeR+ with a baseline
that applies exhaustive analysis and two state-of-the-art approaches for
adaptation space reduction that rely on learning. Results show that DLASeR+ is
effective with a negligible effect on the realization of the adaptation goals
compared to an exhaustive analysis approach, and supports three common types of
adaptation goals beyond the state-of-the-art approaches.]]></summary>

catchment attributes that traditionally originate from catchment hydrology,
flood frequency analysis and their interplay. In this work, we deviated from
this traditional path by formulating and extensively investigating the first
regression-based streamflow regionalization frameworks that largely emerge from
general-purpose time series features for data science and, more precisely, from
a large variety of such features. We focused on 28 features that included
(partial) autocorrelation, entropy, temporal variation, seasonality, trend,
lumpiness, stability, nonlinearity, linearity, spikiness, curvature and others.
We estimated these features for daily temperature, precipitation and streamflow
time series from 511 catchments, and then merged them within regionalization
contexts with traditional topographic, land cover, soil and geologic
attributes. Precipitation and temperature features (e.g., the spectral entropy,
seasonality strength and lag-1 autocorrelation of the precipitation time
series, and the stability and trend strength of the temperature time series)
were found to be useful predictors of many streamflow features. The same
applies to traditional attributes, such as the catchment mean elevation.
Relationships between predictor and dependent variables were also revealed,
while the spectral entropy, the seasonality strength and several
autocorrelation features of the streamflow time series were found to be more
regionalizable than others.]]></summary>

randomization is both in the time window locations and the frequency sampling,

the spectrogram leads to a sharp separation between time-frequency clusters

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Structured and grounded representation of text is typically formalized by
closed information extraction, the problem of extracting an exhaustive set of
(subject, relation, object) triplets that are consistent with a predefined set
of entities and relations from a knowledge base schema. Most existing works are
pipelines prone to error accumulation, and all approaches are only applicable
to unrealistically small numbers of entities and relations. We introduce GenIE
(generative information extraction), the first end-to-end autoregressive
formulation of closed information extraction. GenIE naturally exploits the
language knowledge from the pre-trained transformer by autoregressively
generating relations and entities in textual form. Thanks to a new bi-level
constrained generation strategy, only triplets consistent with the predefined
knowledge base schema are produced. Our experiments show that GenIE is
state-of-the-art on closed information extraction, generalizes from fewer
training data points than baselines, and scales to a previously unmanageable
number of entities and relations. With this work, closed information extraction
becomes practical in realistic scenarios, providing new opportunities for
downstream tasks. Finally, this work paves the way towards a unified end-to-end
approach to the core tasks of information extraction. Code, data and models

information is central to many problems in statistics and machine learning, but
challenging in high dimensions. This paper presents estimators of entropy via
inference (EEVI), which deliver upper and lower bounds on many information

estimators use importance sampling with proposal distribution families that
include amortized variational inference and sequential Monte Carlo, which can
be tailored to the target model and used to squeeze true information values
with high accuracy. We present several theoretical properties of EEVI and
demonstrate scalability and efficacy on two problems from the medical domain:
(i) in an expert system for diagnosing liver disorders, we rank medical tests
according to how informative they are about latent diseases, given a pattern of
observed symptoms and patient attributes; and (ii) in a differential equation
model of carbohydrate metabolism, we find optimal times to take blood glucose
measurements that maximize information about a diabetic patient's insulin

However, I am looking for other approaches that can be more suitable for drawing 1-pixel lines especially since the ground truth paths are indicated as 1-pixel-wide lines (1-pixel thickness) but the connections in the images have wider thicknesses.
 Any ideas for architecture or methods?

 A few days back, I was searching for AI-based image up sampling models in for use within an offline JavaScript app. The latest approaches, such as SwinIR were unavailable for Javascript, so I just created a notebook that converts the SwinIR model from torch to TFJS in a relatively short kaggle kernel. I believe other transformer architectures can also be ported to JS like this. This is the link to the original paper of SwinIR.
 It requires around 1 GB of RAM to run. The size of model folder is 44 MB. It is quantized to float16.
 Anyway, hope someone will find this useful for their website or some other app.

 Output pixels have a 1-to-1 mapping with input pixels (since odd-sized kernels have a proper "center"). This is considered a nice property -- perhaps (for instance) avoiding aliasing issues during segmentation tasks.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[3D landscape modeling has seen a rise in its popularity and applications in recent years. It has countless applications in the fields of civil engineering, earth sciences, military applications, and many others. Geometric 3D models are typically developed using the city geography markup language (CityGML), and the Level-of-Detail (LoD) building model is the preferred model for building 3D models using CityGML. 
 The use of Satellite imagery for landscape modeling provides the advantage of covering a wide area and is low cost. However, developing LoD2 models using satellite imagery remains a big challenge. Building models in such a way involves complex steps demanding heuristics-based approaches and ML-based detection paradigms.
 In a recent paper, researchers at the Ohio State University propose a SAT2LoD2 to facilitate the development of 3D landscape models. SAT2LoD2 is an open-source, python-based GUI-enabled software that takes the satellite images as inputs and returns LoD2 building models as outputs. The software also has the feature of taking road networks and custom maps as additional inputs for better results.

Modern conversational agents need to integrate with an ever-increasing number of services to perform a wide variety of tasks, from booking flights and finding restaurants, to playing music and telling jokes. Adding this functionality can be difficult — for each new task, one needs to collect new data and retrain the models that power the conversational agent. This is because most task-oriented dialogue (TOD) models are trained on a single task-specific ontology. An ontology is generally represented as a list of possible user intents (e.g., if the user wants to book a flight, if the user wants to play some music, etc.) and possible parameter slots to extract from the conversation (e.g., the date of the flight, the…]]></summary>

 Not speaking specifically about autoencoders here, but about general neural networks. As I understand correctly, "latent space" refers to one of the fully connected layers of the network and the dimensionality of the space is equal to the number of the neurons in this layer. This would mean, that each of the layers has a different "latent space" representation of the learned data distribution. Do I understand it correctly? 
 I got really confused because people seem to sometimes refer to latent space as to all of the possible activations of all of the neurons in the network (each neuron of the network is one dimension of a latent space) OR EVEN to all of the PARAMETERS of the network (each parameter is one dimension of the latent space (??)). Do we have a separate name for these? How do we call the parameter space of a neural network? Is my original intuition even correct?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm trying to train a seq2seq model that generates a sentence with T words using reinforcement learning. The input and all the previously generated words form the state of the environment, and generating a word in the sentence is considered an action. In the previous methods [1, 2], the immediate reward r(s_t, a_t, s_{t+1}) for the t-th action a_t is 0 when t < T, and the reward is the CIDEr score (a scalar that measures the quality of the sentence) of the entire sentence when t = T. The policy is updated after the entire sentence is generated.
 I designed a new reward for each action, and the new reward for the t-th action is not zero when t < T. However, the reward of each action can only be calculated when the entire sentence is generated since it relies on the CIDEr score of the entire sentence, i.e. the reward for all the actions relies on the final state s_T. Can I still define the reward in the form of r(s_t, a_t, s_{t+1}) ?

 Very often, I found that many of the tools or managed service of AI platform, are not very welcome by many users. Some think these tools are unnecessarily complicated.
 I'm currently developing a library in my free time trying to fill the gap. And I also want the library to get well integrated with most users' deployment environments.
 Would you like to share how and where do you serve your model? Using kubernetes? Self developed or existing tools? Thanks～

I recently created & published a dataset of YouTube video thumbnails on Kaggle (YouTube Thumbnail Dataset), I've tried to make the dataset as diverse as possible, It contains thumbnails from all varieties of YouTube channels. This dataset goes hand in hand with another dataset (containing YouTube video annotations) that I created, namely YouTubers Saying Things.
 The dataset contains 91 unique YouTube channels, and 10 categories, these categories are assigned by me manually to these channels. (Comedy, Science, Automobile, VideoGames, Food, Entertainment, Informative, Blog, News, Tech)
 All kinds of feedback and criticism are welcome, and also if you guys want some particular channel to be included in both these datasets, feel free to comment on this post, or raise an issue on the Github repositories for both these datasets, I will surely add them in the next version.

 I am currently working with a small dataset from a company in Spain (short history) and the scoring is poor. I have worked before with the same company in France and the scoring was great as I had plenty of data thanks to a big history. How could I improve my score with the data from Spain with the help of data from France ? 
 Could I use transfer learning, or data mutualization, or data augmentation ? If anyone has faced before a similar problem, or has read some papers about it, I would love to hear about it. 
 Thank you!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In this research, the researchers from the paper ‘ LilNetX: Lightweight Networks with EXtreme Model Compression and Structured Sparsification’ talk about the importance of larger parameter-heavy and computationally costly architectures in deep neural networks (DNNs) and how it improves the computer vision tasks. They also mentioned in the paper that it is not as simple as it seems since, as the DNNs become more common in the business, they are frequently required to be trained multiple times, communicated across the network to various devices, and executed under hardware limits with minimum loss of accuracy, all while maintaining accuracy. Then the question arises of how to reduce the models’ size on the devices while still enhancing their run-time. Explorations in this field have tended to take one of two paths: lowering model size via compression approaches or reducing computing demands through model pruning.
 The main achievement of this research from the University of Maryland and Google Research is the introduction of ‘LilNetX’, an end-to-end trainable neural network technique that allows learning models with specified accuracy-rate-computation trade-offs. Prior work has taken a piecemeal approach to these difficulties, which necessitates post-processing or multistage training, which is not efficient and does not scale well for big datasets or architectures. To encourage modest model size, the strategy is to create a joint training goal that penalizes the self-information of network parameters in a reparameterized latent space while simultaneously incorporating priors to increase structured sparsity in the parameter space to decrease computation.

 Is it possible to generate a good reliable model using only 7 features for 12 action spaces?
 Number of feature or quality of feature is important for taking good decision in RL.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey all,
 Im trying to get up to date with Deep Learning literature, so the last week I was going through CNNs. Here's a general view of what Ive learned so far.
  
Large filters suck, you can get better accuracy with smaller filters and more non linearities
 
Depth is the most important for CNNs over width or filter sizes.
 
ReLU activation is generally better, as Sigmoid/tanh gradients tend to fall off towards the ends
 
Convolution layers are only translation invariant. Stacking multiple features together and passing them through MaxPool helps rotational invariance and scaling although not completely 
 
Residual connection help address vanishing gradient and help improve the overall training procedure
 
Inception models worked well, as they mixed different filter sizes together helping the model learn diverse features
 
Most current work is with Transformers, although Im not sure why. ConvNext shows similar performance can be achieved through large CNNs
 
 Do add to this if I missed anything, or if there's anything you don't know about

So I wanted to re-implement APT(Behavior From the Void: Unsupervised Active Pre-Training). but my re-implementation showed not meaningful behaviors compared to official implementation. official implementation uses drq-v2 and intrinsic curiosity module. So, I want to re-implement APT as described in paper(using drq-v1 and contrastive learning).
 Is there someone to check my reimplementation?
 https://github.com/seolhokim/apt
 In that repository, DrQ-v1 works well, but only apt doesn't work! I can't understand why agent stop moving when pre-training.
 ​
 Really thank you for reading.

I would like to make a model that reads the game video output and predicts the arrow key inputs to get a fast lap time. It seems, to me, that a CNN with encoder-decoder layers trained on the keyboard inputs would work. Is this a good architecture? I'm also having a hard time finding useful literature.
 please let me know if there is anything I should look into or do differently.

LiDAR and visual cameras are two types of complementary sensors used for 3D object detection in autonomous vehicles and robots. LiDAR, which is a remote sensing technique that uses light in the form of a pulsed laser to measure ranges, provides low-resolution shape and depth information, while cameras provide high-resolution shape and texture information. While the features captured by LiDAR and cameras should be merged together to provide optimal 3D object detection, it turns out that most state-of-the-art 3D object detectors use LiDAR as the only input. The main reason is that to develop robust 3D object detection models, most methods need to augment and transform th…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In recent years, the rise of Deep Learning has continuously brought innovations to many fields, and the medical domain is one of them. AI applications in this field are countless: from pre-operative diagnosis to disease classification, from skill assessment to post-operative rehabilitation. Among them, systems to assess surgical skills and provide feedback to improve technique could help in decreasing the number of complications in surgical procedures, which are still the third leading cause of death globally.
 AI can be an additional coach for surgical trainees and an expert colleague for experienced surgeons. But, to train an AI system, reliable data are fundamental. The more utilized type of data in this context is undoubtedly video streams, as a camera is less invasive than other types of sensors, such as ArmBand or EEG, which could weigh on the surgeon’s performance given their physical bulk. This applies particularly to laparoscopic surgery, where an in-body fiber-optic camera is used to visualize the operating area and facilitate rapid data collection. For this reason, the majority of computer-assisted systems focus on laparoscopic surgery.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi everyone!
 I'm really happy to finally publish the work I've been doing on the Cellular Automata called Lenia. It is a JAX library called Leniax and allows one to simulate thousands of simulations in parallel using CPU, GPU, or TPU.
 With it, you can:
  
Simulate Conway's Game of Life
 Simulate multiple Lenia simulations in parallel
 Use gradient descent to search for Continuous CA parameters
 Launch a QD search to discover a ton of diversity in Lenia.
  
Check out the blog post for some visual results
 The main goal of this work was to advance the state of automatic discovery for those systems. 10 months ago, I bet on QD to do so, turns out it indeed works! QD algorithms really rock!
 The code is completely open-source with all the examples, notebooks, and even experiments I ran. (See the doc for more links)
 I would love to have feedback on this and of course, if you find that subject interesting, engage with our community!
 Cheers!

 By examining the data, I think one of the reasons is that some of the defects such as cracks, or faded pavement markings are not so clear and either casted by a shadow or too bright from the sun.
 Image Example #1
 Or from motion blur
 Image Example #2
 Is there any image preprocessing technique aside maybe from CLAHE that could be applied? Moreover, I am currently using YOLOv5 for this.

 I thought it would be straightforward to train a backbone on a big retail dataset(1000+ classes), and then use that as pretrained and it'll reduce the time it takes for my models to generalize.
 Turns out, the model took more epochs to train when using the retail backbone, then the imagenet one. 
 Isn't this counter-intuitive? What else can I do to make by backbone better?

 I have a fairly interesting project that I am working on. I have a model that has some samples which are completely unpredictable, random noise, and some that are reliably predictable.
 How would you go about separating out the samples which can be predicted, identifying them going forward, and retraining on a cleaned dataset with only those samples?
 Interested to see someone else's approach to this.
 Edit: I forgot to mention that my data is from an embedding matrix from ordinal categorical features.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Does anyone have experience training agents to play platformer games like mario? I am trying to train an agent for the platformer game Jump King to get past atleast a few levels, using DQN but the agent is performing poorly after 8000 episodes of training, (one episode being the agent spawns at the start and has 15 seconds or so to jump around gaining reward) he is barely able to get past the first level most of the time :c
 I am using a very basic sequential network of 2 Linear layers with inputDim 4, outputDim 4, and hiddenDim 32. and because my state is not using any image data, its just (current_level, x_pos, y_pos, jumpCount) as input to the network . As for the reward, I am using the y position to give reward if the agent is getting to a new level (large reward) or making progress in the current level (curr_y > old_y), otherwise the agent gets a negative reward.
 Should I consider using a CNN and image data to train this agent like in the atari games paper, or is using image data and a conv net going to perform worse rather than using my current state? Should I consider combining image data with the current state, or just keeping the current non-image data state but ?
 Also, roughly how long should I be training the agent for? is 8000 episodes not enough? 1 episode takes roughly 7 seconds in time (it is using pygame engine and I turned off the rendering and I think that made it a little bit faster)
 This is my first time training an agent for a hard game like this using DQN so I would appreciate any tips/advice to improve the agent! repo: https://github.com/senweim/JumpKingAtHome

 This was before transformers blew up, before StyleGAN, before GPT-2, when WaveNet and DeepDream were still among the best we could do, and when predictive text algorithms that were barely better than Markov Chains were still the state of the art. In five short years, the state of artificial intelligence has changed overwhelmingly, to the point it's barely recognizable. Looking back to 2017, I now get this sense of everything feeling so primitive and fake. I've stated many times that AI before roughly 2019 was a bunch of digital magic tricks, and the field as a whole was essentially a giant Potemkin village that utilized clever sleight of hand and advertising to make it se…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey guys,
 I tried building a PPO model for Wordle.
 My initial test was checking the performance of the model with just 100 words. The agent was able to learn within a few thousand epochs and had an average guess length of about 2.8 before it could correctly identify the words.
 However, when i extend the action space to the entire 2.3k words, the model barely learns. Even after a few 100k iterations, the mean length revolves around 5.9 (given wordle has a max of 6 attempts per game)
 Any suggestions on how to help the agent learn faster in large action spaces?
 ​
 I also tried an embedding based approach, but the performance was very similar.
 ​
 Thanks

 Yes, the paper is cautious about comparing the model one-to-one to the brain
  
“Note, we are not saying the brain is closely related to transformers because it learns the same neural representations, instead we are saying the relationship is close because we have shown a mathematical relationship between transformers and carefully formulated neuroscience models of the hippocampal formation.”
  
While objections like "its just correlation/relation, its not exactly the same!!" are true to an extend, its still a very unexpected observation that, they're even remotely similar. Needless to say, Transformers were not inspired from the brain - and as more evidence collates (https://www.nature.com/articles/s42003-022-03036-1 --> Activations are linearly correlatable) it does feel mysterious; perhaps atleast some of the systems used by the brain converge on an efficient pattern discovered by our backpropogated friends...

 The papers on CoinRun usually just show the results after 100mm steps or so, but I am more interested in what the community has achieved with "normal setups".

But I've read that some people consider MSR most prestigious due to their academic environment. But I've seen that Google and FB dominate in terms of major publications, ie: vision transformers are associated with Google.

 As a sort of art experiment, I want to train an AI to write tech news articles based on my own work.
 I worked as a freelance writer for several years and have thousands of articles (each as a Word doc) on tech news.
 I want to use those articles to train the AI, then have it generate new articles to post to a blog. I have a pretty good understanding of machine learning, but have never trained a model myself. I'm hoping you all can provide some direction. Some specific questions:
  
Can you recommend a model?
 For each training article, can I provide a "source" (like another news article) so the AI understands where the content in the training article came from? *
 For each generated article, can I provide a news article source for it to base its content on? **
 Can I use the Word docs as the training set, or do I need to convert them into something else for training?
  
*as an example: If I wrote an article on the release of a new Raspberry Pi board, my source might be the press release on the Raspberry Pi website.
 **as an example: If I want it to generate an article about a new drone delivery service, my input source might be a news article on Reuters or something.

 Today we open-sourced Squirrel, a data infrastructure library that my colleagues and I have been working on over the past 1.5 years: https://github.com/merantix-momentum/squirrel-core
 We’re a team of ~30 ML engineers developing machine learning solutions for industry and research. Across all our projects, we need to load large-scale data in a fast and cost-efficient way, while keeping the flexibility to work with any possible dataset, loaded from local storage, remote data buckets or via APIs such as HuggingFace. Not finding what we were looking for, we decided to build it ourselves. 
 Squirrel has already proven its value in our deep learning projects at Merantix Momentum and shows competitive benchmark results (check them out here). 
 We’re super excited to share it with the OSS community and hope that you can benefit from it as well! 
 Looking forward to hearing your feedback and questions :)

Preferably, I do the setting up of the environment only once (downloading of the data, model, software packages, etc) only once and then simply send ~100-200 scripts each to their own GPU for processing. Then at the end everything is in the same location and I can easily send back the final result file (~100-200 output files concatenated together) back to my PC.
 Any advice on how to do that? All GPU renting servers only have 1-8 GPUs per server and do not (seem) to allow for sharing of the environment, which seems very inefficient to me. All comments are appreciated.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, was wondering if anyone else has looked into "A PAC-Bayesian Analysis of Randomized Learning
 with Application to Stochastic Gradient Descent" and in particular eqn. 2, which is the derivation of Section 3.5 of "Train faster, generalize better: Stability of stochastic gradient descent" adapted for the case where the underlying loss we are interested in guaranteeing generalisation for is upper bounded by M (rather than 1 as assumed by Hardt et al).
 In the case of minibatch SGD, the number of datapoints n becomes the number of minibatches, as ideally one would like to reduce the number of steps T by maximizing the learning rate, which requires maximizing the minibatch size for the loss to actually converge to 0 on the training data. 
 However, what I am unsure about is, specifically for the classification task where we typically minimize the cross-entropy objective, whether the cross-entropy objective is an upper bound on any kind of M-bounded loss function. In the ideal world, I would like to show that it upper bounds the 0-1 loss which means the cross-entropy over the dataset is an upper bound on the classification accuracy and any generalization statement automatically becomes a statement about the very practical metric of accuracy. 
 Such a statement about cross-entropy upper-bounding 0-1 is made in Section 3C of "Theoretical Issues in Deep Networks: Approximation, Optimization and Generalization". However, one can provide a counterexample in the limit of the softmax "temperature" parameter where the predicted class distribution becomes uniform, in the case of 2 classes, for the typical case of log being the natural logarithm (it is no longer a counter-example if log base 2 is used).
 I haven't been able to show or find proof that this statement "xent >= 0-1" is true (for some logarithm base and some number of classes) and was hoping that someone might have.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Object detection is a crucial problem in computer vision, and YOLO (You Only Look Once) one-stage object detectors have set the bar for performance since the release of YOLOv1 in 2015. The YOLO series has undergone considerable network and structural improvements over the years. The most recent version, YOLOX, has attained an optimal balance of speed and accuracy on the NVIDIA Tesla V100 Tensor Core GPU.
 Baidu researchers have improved their earlier PP-YOLOv2 model, resulting in PP-YOLOE, a cutting-edge industrial object detector that beats YOLOv5 and YOLOX in speed and accuracy trade-off. The team’s PP-YOLOE-l variant outperforms PP-YOLOv2 by 1.9 percent AP and YOLOX-l by 1.3 percent AP on COCO datasets.
 The PP-YOLOv2 baseline model architecture comprises a ResNet50-vd backbone with deformable convolution, a PAN neck with an SPP layer and DropBlock, and a lightweight IoU aware head. PP-YOLOv2 assigns only one anchor box to each ground truth object, similar to YOLOv3. It is strongly reliant on hand-crafted design, which may not generalize well enough when trained on other datasets. Conversely, this technique necessitates a lot of additional hyperparameters.
 To overcome this problem, Baidu researchers have added an anchor-free technique to PP-YOLOv2 that tiles one anchor point on each pixel and assigns upper and lower bounds for detecting heads to assign ground facts to a matching feature map. The center of a bounding box can then be determined to choose positive samples from the closest pixels. A 4D vector is also predicted for regression, with minor model speedups and precision losses due to the changes.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all,
 I've been working on reinforcement learning lately, but wanted to come to the general ML subreddit to seek inspiration from other disciplines.
 I've been working on strategies to decrease the training time for my real-world inverted pendulum experiment. Specifically, I am trying to pre-train the Q network in a simulation before deploying.
 The strategy that I have found most successful right now is this:
 start with randomly generated weights
 REPEAT OF AN EPOCH:
 - Load new_weights to Q Network
 - initialize an environment with randomly generated parameters (i.e. random mass, lengths, etc).
 - Train agent on environment for 100 episodes
 - Save new_weights
 I have tried a variety of strategies to add a little bit more control over this process. I've tried a soft update that never showed improvement.
 W = old_weights * (1 - alpha) + new_weights * alpha 
 I have tried an additive update which was slightly successful. Measured the success of each network as the sum of rewards over the epoch.
 A = (old_R)/(old_R+new_R) ; B = (new_R)/(old_R+new_R) W = old_weights * A + new_weights * B 
 But none of these work as well as just using the most recent weights. I've included some results if anyone's interested. The first graph is three test trials with random initial weights, the second graph is with pre-trained weights.
 This is a pretty hand-wavy way of doing this, does anyone have any suggestions to do this better?

 ​
 1) Multivariate (at least 3 or 4, and probably no more than 50 or 100 as an upper bound).
 2) High frequency (Ideally at least once every 5-10 minutes)
 3) We need to have some notion of an underlying 'state' of the data for certain windows. E.g. in an energy setting, period X was the 'family at home using appliances' state. Or in the healthcare setting, period X is 'the patient is in a stable state' while period Y is something like 'the patient experiences a cardiac event'
 ​
 ​
 Nice to have:
 4) It'd be great if some features had some level of seasonality while others didn't.
 ​
 ​
 Do folks have any recommendations for datasets that meet some (or hopefully all) of the criteria? I did some light pursuing on UCI, but it seems like much of it is not high frequency enough, and/or doesn't have some notion of underlying states.

 I am currently working on a research paper that I aim to publish at a reputable conference shortly. In our work, we borrow a feature engineering technique from one of the papers that have not been previously applied to the domain (time series AD) before that paper. However, the authors haven't released the source code of their implementation of the model (but the feature engineering technique is publicly available). I feel like that is an important baseline and just failing to include it would get my paper rejected. I have contacted all the authors for the source code, but none of them responded. The architecture they use is a fairly complicated one and would be very difficult to implement on my own. How do I go about this situation? My advisor told me I can just include a few points on the footnote on why we don't include this as a baseline. Those being:
  
No open-source implementation
 Contacted the authors, didn't receive a response
 The paper has not been published, only uploaded to arxiv.
  
Any help is appreciated!

machine learning on graphs. Inspired by the success of neural networks, a line
of research has been conducted to train GNNs to deal with various tasks, such
as node classification, graph classification, and link prediction. In this
work, our task of interest is graph classification. Several GNN models have
been proposed and shown great accuracy in this task. However, the question is
whether usual training methods fully realize the capacity of the GNN models.

In this work, we propose a two-stage training framework based on triplet
loss. In the first stage, GNN is trained to map each graph to a Euclidean-space
vector so that graphs of the same class are close while those of different
classes are mapped far apart. Once graphs are well-separated based on labels, a
classifier is trained to distinguish between different classes. This method is
generic in the sense that it is compatible with any GNN model. By adapting five
GNN models to our method, we demonstrate the consistent improvement in accuracy
and utilization of each GNN's allocated capacity over the original training
method of each model up to 5.4\% points in 12 datasets.]]></summary>

such as graphs, texts, or images. Following spherical and hyperbolic spaces,
more general product spaces have been proposed. However, searching for the best
configuration of product space is a resource-intensive procedure, which reduces
the practical applicability of the idea. We generalize the concept of product
space and introduce an overlapping space that does not have the configuration
search problem. The main idea is to allow subsets of coordinates to be shared
between spaces of different types (Euclidean, hyperbolic, spherical). As a
result, parameter optimization automatically learns the optimal configuration.
Additionally, overlapping spaces allow for more compact representations since
their geometry is more complex. Our experiments confirm that overlapping spaces
outperform the competitors in graph embedding tasks. Here, we consider both
distortion setup, where the aim is to preserve distances, and ranking setup,
where the relative order should be preserved. The proposed method effectively
solves the problem and outperforms the competitors in both settings. We also
perform an empirical analysis in a realistic information retrieval task, where
we compare all spaces by incorporating them into DSSM. In this case, the
proposed overlapping space consistently achieves nearly optimal results without
any configuration tuning. This allows for reducing training time, which can be
significant in large-scale applications.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Neural Architecture Search (NAS) has shifted network design from using human
intuition to leveraging search algorithms guided by evaluation metrics. We
study channel size optimization in convolutional neural networks (CNN) and
identify the role it plays in model accuracy and complexity. Current channel
size selection methods are generally limited by discrete sample spaces while
suffering from manual iteration and simple heuristics. To solve this, we
introduce an efficient dynamic scaling algorithm -- CONet -- that automatically
optimizes channel sizes across network layers for a given CNN. Two metrics --
"\textit{Rank}" and "\textit{Rank Average Slope}" -- are introduced to identify
the information accumulated in training. The algorithm dynamically scales
channel sizes up or down over a fixed searching phase. We conduct experiments
on CIFAR10/100 and ImageNet datasets and show that CONet can find efficient and
accurate architectures searched in ResNet, DARTS, and DARTS+ spaces that
outperform their baseline models.

This document supersedes previously published paper in ICCV2021-NeurArch
workshop. An additional section is included on manual scaling of channel size
in CNNs to numerically validate of the metrics used in searching optimum
channel configurations in CNNs.]]></summary>

sparse coding problem while also providing uncertainty quantification. The most
popular inference algorithms for SBL exhibit prohibitively large computational
costs for high-dimensional problems due to the need to maintain a large
covariance matrix. To resolve this issue, we introduce a new method for
accelerating SBL inference -- named covariance-free expectation maximization
(CoFEM) -- that avoids explicit computation of the covariance matrix. CoFEM
solves multiple linear systems to obtain unbiased estimates of the posterior
statistics needed by SBL. This is accomplished by exploiting innovations from
numerical linear algebra such as preconditioned conjugate gradient and a
little-known diagonal estimation rule. For a large class of compressed sensing
matrices, we provide theoretical justifications for why our method scales well
in high-dimensional settings. Through simulations, we show that CoFEM can be up
to thousands of times faster than existing baselines without sacrificing coding
accuracy. Through applications to calcium imaging deconvolution and
multi-contrast MRI reconstruction, we show that CoFEM enables SBL to tractably
tackle high-dimensional sparse coding problems of practical interest.]]></summary>

transformations of Gaussians. Given samples of the form $p(x)$, where $x\sim
N(0, \mathrm{Id}_r)$ is hidden and $p: \mathbb{R}^r \to \mathbb{R}^d$ is a
function where every output coordinate is a low-degree polynomial, the goal is
to learn the distribution over $p(x)$. This problem is natural in its own
right, but is also an important special case of learning deep generative
models, namely pushforwards of Gaussians under two-layer neural networks with
polynomial activations. Understanding the learnability of such generative
models is crucial to understanding why they perform so well in practice.

Our first main result is a polynomial-time algorithm for learning quadratic
transformations of Gaussians in a smoothed setting. Our second main result is a
polynomial-time algorithm for learning constant-degree polynomial
transformations of Gaussian in a smoothed setting, when the rank of the
associated tensors is small. In fact our results extend to any
rotation-invariant input distribution, not just Gaussian. These are the first
end-to-end guarantees for learning a pushforward under a neural network with
more than one layer.

Along the way, we also give the first polynomial-time algorithms with
provable guarantees for tensor ring decomposition, a popular generalization of
tensor decomposition that is used in practice to implicitly store large

analyzing the impact potential sensing attacks could have, our objective is to
develop learning-enabled attack generators capable of designing stealthy
attacks that maximally degrade system operation. We show how such problem can
be cast within a learning-based grey-box framework where parts of the runtime
information are known to the attacker, and introduce two models based on
feed-forward neural networks (FNN); both models are trained offline, using a
cost function that combines the attack effects on the estimation error and the
residual signal used for anomaly detection, so that the trained models are
capable of recursively generating such effective sensor attacks in real-time.
The effectiveness of the proposed methods is illustrated on several case

without ground-truth labels by maximizing the similarity between latent
representations of similar signal segments. In this framework various data
augmentation techniques are usually exploited to help enforce desired
invariances within the learned representations, improving performance on
various audio tasks thanks to more robust embeddings. Now, selecting the most

Thus, this work introduces a conditional independance-based method which allows
for automatically selecting a suitable distribution on the choice of
augmentations and their parametrization from a set of predefined ones, for
contrastive self-supervised pre-training. This is performed with respect to a
downstream task of interest, hence saving a costly hyper-parameter search.
Experiments performed on two different downstream tasks validate the proposed

algorithm to solve general nonlinear nonaffine optimal control problems with
known dynamics. Unlike previous ADP algorithms, it can directly deal with
problems with state constraints. Firstly, a constrained generalized policy
iteration (CGPI) framework is developed to handle state constraints by
transforming the traditional policy improvement process into a constrained
policy optimization problem. Next, we propose an actor-critic variant of CGPI,
called CADP, in which both policy and value functions are approximated by
multi-layer neural networks to directly map the system states to control inputs
and value function, respectively. CADP linearizes the constrained optimization
problem locally into a quadratically constrained linear programming problem,
and then obtains the optimal update of the policy network by solving its dual
problem. A trust region constraint is added to prevent excessive policy update,
thus ensuring linearization accuracy. We determine the feasibility of the
policy optimization problem by calculating the minimum trust region boundary
and update the policy using two recovery rules when infeasible. The vehicle
control problem in the path-tracking task is used to demonstrate the
effectiveness of this proposed method.]]></summary>

powerful deep learning frameworks such as TensorFlow and PyTorch that make it
easier to develop deep learning models. However, these libraries also come with
steep learning curves, since programming in these frameworks is quite different

In this work, we present a tool called TF-Coder for programming by example in

value-based pruning of equivalent expressions and flexible type- and
value-based filtering to ensure that expressions adhere to various requirements
imposed by the TensorFlow library. We train models to predict TensorFlow

data and depend on either error-prone time-alignment and duration features or
explicit music score information. In this paper, we propose Karaoker, a
multispeaker Tacotron-based model conditioned on voice characteristic features
that is trained exclusively on spoken data without requiring time-alignments.
Karaoker synthesizes singing voice following a multi-dimensional template
extracted from a source waveform of an unseen speaker/singer. The model is
jointly conditioned with a single deep convolutional encoder on continuous data
including pitch, intensity, harmonicity, formants, cepstral peak prominence and
octaves. We extend the text-to-speech training objective with feature
reconstruction, classification and speaker identification tasks that guide the
model to an accurate result. Except for multi-tasking, we also employ a
Wasserstein GAN training scheme as well as new losses on the acoustic model's
output to further refine the quality of the model.]]></summary>

optimization problems in the past two decades, and various optimization methods
incorporating surrogates into optimization have been proposed. Most research
focuses on either exploiting the surrogate by defining a utility optimization
problem or customizing an existing optimization method to use one or multiple
approximation models. However, only a little attention has been paid to generic
concepts applicable to different types of algorithms and optimization problems
simultaneously. Thus this paper proposes a generalized probabilistic
surrogate-assisted framework (GPSAF), applicable to a broad category of
unconstrained and constrained, single- and multi-objective optimization
algorithms. The idea is based on a surrogate assisting an existing optimization
method. The assistance is based on two distinct phases, one facilitating
exploration and another exploiting the surrogates. The exploration and
exploitation of surrogates are automatically balanced by performing a
probabilistic knockout tournament among different clusters of solutions. A
study of multiple well-known population-based optimization algorithms is
conducted with and without the proposed surrogate assistance on single- and
multi-objective optimization problems with a maximum solution evaluation budget
of 300 or less. The results indicate the effectiveness of applying GPSAF to an
optimization algorithm and the competitiveness with other surrogate-assisted
algorithms.]]></summary>

human-designed input-output pairs -- is an alternative evaluation method of
natural language processing systems proposed to address the shortcomings of the
standard approach: computing metrics on held-out data. While behavioural tests
capture human prior knowledge and insights, there has been little exploration
on how to leverage them for model training and development. With this in mind,
we explore behaviour-aware learning by examining several fine-tuning schemes
using HateCheck, a suite of functional tests for hate speech detection systems.
To address potential pitfalls of training on data originally intended for
evaluation, we train and evaluate models on different configurations of
HateCheck by holding out categories of test cases, which enables us to estimate
performance on potentially overlooked system properties. The fine-tuning
procedure led to improvements in the classification accuracy of held-out
functionalities and identity groups, suggesting that models can potentially
generalise to overlooked functionalities. However, performance on held-out
functionality classes and i.i.d. hate speech detection data decreased, which
indicates that generalisation occurs mostly across functionalities from the
same class and that the procedure led to overfitting to the HateCheck data
distribution.]]></summary>

an important capability of modern business process monitoring systems. Existing

evaluation of a novel text-aware process prediction model based on Long
Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks and natural language models. The
proposed model can take categorical, numerical and textual attributes in event
data into account to predict the activity and timestamp of the next event, the
outcome, and the cycle time of a running process instance. Experiments show
that the text-aware model is able to outperform state-of-the-art process

Most previous works assume that the data lies in the whole ambient space. We
propose to take a new angle and take the manifold assumption into
consideration. Assuming data lies in a manifold, we investigate two new types
of adversarial risk, the normal adversarial risk due to perturbation along
normal direction, and the in-manifold adversarial risk due to perturbation
within the manifold. We prove that the classic adversarial risk can be bounded
from both sides using the normal and in-manifold adversarial risks. We also
show with a surprisingly pessimistic case that the standard adversarial risk
can be nonzero even when both normal and in-manifold risks are zero. We
finalize the paper with empirical studies supporting our theoretical results.
Our results suggest the possibility of improving the robustness of a classifier
by only focusing on the normal adversarial risk.]]></summary>

constructing training mini-batches. This paper studies whether this common
practice improves learning and how. We compare it to an alternative setting
where each mini-batch is uniformly sampled from all the training data, labeled
or not, which greatly reduces direct supervision from true labels in typical
low-label regimes. However, this simpler setting can also be seen as more
general and even necessary in multi-task problems where over-sampling labeled
data would become intractable. Our experiments on semi-supervised CIFAR-10
image classification using FixMatch show a performance drop when using the
uniform sampling approach which diminishes when the amount of labeled data or
the training time increases. Further, we analyse the training dynamics to
understand how over-sampling of labeled data compares to uniform sampling. Our
main finding is that over-sampling is especially beneficial early in training
but gets less important in the later stages when more pseudo-labels become
correct. Nevertheless, we also find that keeping some true labels remains
important to avoid the accumulation of confirmation errors from incorrect
pseudo-labels.]]></summary>

many computer vision applications. Despite the great synthesis quality,
training GANs often confronts several issues, including non-convergence, mode
collapse, and gradient vanishing. There exist several workarounds, for example,
regularizing Lipschitz continuity and adopting Wasserstein distance. Although
these methods can partially solve the problems, we argue that the problems are
result from modeling the discriminator with deep neural networks. In this
paper, we base on newly derived deep neural network theories called Neural
Tangent Kernel (NTK) and propose a new generative algorithm called generative
adversarial NTK (GA-NTK). The GA-NTK models the discriminator as a Gaussian
Process (GP). With the help of the NTK theories, the training dynamics of
GA-NTK can be described with a closed-form formula. To synthesize data with the
closed-form formula, the objectives can be simplified into a single-level
adversarial optimization problem. We conduct extensive experiments on
real-world datasets, and the results show that GA-NTK can generate images
comparable to those by GANs but is much easier to train under various
conditions. We also study the current limitations of GA-NTK and propose some
workarounds to make GA-NTK more practical.]]></summary>

machine-learning problems, and has applications to viral marketing,
diversification, sensor placement, and more. However, the study of maximizing
submodular functions has mainly been restricted in the context of selecting a
set of items. On the other hand, many real-world applications require a
solution that is a ranking over a set of items. The problem of ranking in the
context of submodular function maximization has been considered before, but to
a much lesser extent than item-selection formulations. In this paper, we
explore a novel formulation for ranking items with submodular valuations and
budget constraints. We refer to this problem as max-submodular ranking (MSR).
In more detail, given a set of items and a set of non-decreasing submodular
functions, where each function is associated with a budget, we aim to find a
ranking of the set of items that maximizes the sum of values achieved by all
functions under the budget constraints. For the MSR problem with cardinality-
and knapsack-type budget constraints we propose practical algorithms with
approximation guarantees. In addition, we perform an empirical evaluation,
which demonstrates the superior performance of the proposed algorithms against

this, a natural inquiry is: "for what data generating processes can deep
learning succeed?" In this work, we study the sample complexity of learning
multilayer data generating processes of a sort for which deep neural networks
seem to be suited. We develop general and elegant information-theoretic tools
that accommodate analysis of any data generating process -- shallow or deep,
parametric or nonparametric, noiseless or noisy. We then use these tools to
characterize the dependence of sample complexity on the depth of multilayer

training-time attacks that cause models to "spin" their outputs so as to
support an adversary-chosen sentiment or point of view -- but only when the
input contains adversary-chosen trigger words. For example, a spinned
summarization model outputs positive summaries of any text that mentions the
name of some individual or organization.

Model spinning introduces a "meta-backdoor" into a model. Whereas
conventional backdoors cause models to produce incorrect outputs on inputs with
the trigger, outputs of spinned models preserve context and maintain standard
accuracy metrics, yet also satisfy a meta-task chosen by the adversary.

Model spinning enables propaganda-as-a-service, where propaganda is defined
as biased speech. An adversary can create customized language models that
produce desired spins for chosen triggers, then deploy these models to generate
disinformation (a platform attack), or else inject them into ML training
pipelines (a supply-chain attack), transferring malicious functionality to
downstream models trained by victims.

To demonstrate the feasibility of model spinning, we develop a new
backdooring technique. It stacks an adversarial meta-task onto a seq2seq model,
backpropagates the desired meta-task output to points in the word-embedding
space we call "pseudo-words," and uses pseudo-words to shift the entire output
distribution of the seq2seq model. We evaluate this attack on language
generation, summarization, and translation models with different triggers and
meta-tasks such as sentiment, toxicity, and entailment. Spinned models largely
maintain their accuracy metrics (ROUGE and BLEU) while shifting their outputs
to satisfy the adversary's meta-task. We also show that, in the case of a
supply-chain attack, the spin functionality transfers to downstream models.]]></summary>

only a few entries of a target vector $b\in\mathbb R^n$ and output a near
minimizer to $\min_{x\in\mathbb R^d} \|Ax-b\|$, for a design matrix
$A\in\mathbb R^{n \times d}$ and loss $\|\cdot\|$.

For $p$ norm regression for any $0<p<\infty$, we give an algorithm based on
Lewis weight sampling outputting a $(1+\epsilon)$-approximate solution using
just $\tilde O(d/\epsilon^2)$ queries to $b$ for $p\in(0,1)$,
$\tilde{O}(d/\epsilon)$ queries for $1<p<2$, and
$\tilde{O}(d^{p/2}/\epsilon^p)$ queries for $2<p<\infty$. For $0<p<2$, our
bounds are optimal up to log factors, settling the query complexity for this
range. For $2<p<\infty$, our dependence on $d$ is optimal, while our dependence
on $\epsilon$ is off by at most $\epsilon$, up to log factors. Our result
resolves an open question of [CD21], who gave near optimal bounds for the $1$
norm, but required $d^2/\epsilon^2$ samples for $\ell_p$ regression with
$1<p<2$, and gave no bounds for $2<p<\infty$ or $0<p<1$.

We also give the first total sensitivity bound of
$O(d^{\max\{1,p/2\}}\log^2n)$ for loss functions of degree $p$ polynomial
growth, improving a result of [TMF20]. By combining this with our techniques
for $\ell_p$ regression, we obtain an active regression algorithm making
$\tilde O(d^{1+\max\{1,p/2\}}/\mathrm{poly}(\epsilon))$ queries for such loss
functions, including the Tukey and Huber losses, answering another question of
[CD21]. For the Huber loss, we further improve our bound to $\tilde
O(d^{4-2\sqrt2}/\mathrm{poly}(\epsilon))$ samples. Our sensitivity bounds also
have many applications, including Orlicz norm subspace embeddings, robust
subspace approximation, and dimension reduction for smoothed $p$-norms.

Finally, our active sampling results give the first sublinear time algorithms
for Kronecker product regression under every $p$ norm.]]></summary>

carefully crafted imperceptible noises that can fool the network and can cause
severe consequences when deployed. To encounter them, the model requires
training data for adversarial training or explicit regularization-based
techniques. However, privacy has become an important concern, restricting
access to only trained models but not the training data (e.g. biometric data).
Also, data curation is expensive and companies may have proprietary rights over
it. To handle such situations, we propose a completely novel problem of
'test-time adversarial defense in absence of training data and even their
statistics'. We solve it in two stages: a) detection and b) correction of
adversarial samples. Our adversarial sample detection framework is initially
trained on arbitrary data and is subsequently adapted to the unlabelled test
data through unsupervised domain adaptation. We further correct the predictions
on detected adversarial samples by transforming them in Fourier domain and
obtaining their low frequency component at our proposed suitable radius for
model prediction. We demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed technique via
extensive experiments against several adversarial attacks and for different
model architectures and datasets. For a non-robust Resnet-18 model pre-trained
on CIFAR-10, our detection method correctly identifies 91.42% adversaries.
Also, we significantly improve the adversarial accuracy from 0% to 37.37% with

from noisy labels. Among many other reasons, a significant number of existing
solutions rely on access to it. Estimating the transition matrix without using
ground truth labels is a critical and challenging task. When label noise
transition depends on each instance, the problem of identifying the
instance-dependent noise transition matrix becomes substantially more
challenging. Despite recent works proposing solutions for learning from
instance-dependent noisy labels, we lack a unified understanding of when such a
problem remains identifiable, and therefore learnable. This paper seeks to
provide answers to a sequence of related questions: What are the primary
factors that contribute to the identifiability of a noise transition matrix?
Can we explain the observed empirical successes? When a problem is not
identifiable, what can we do to make it so? We will relate our theoretical
findings to the literature and hope to provide guidelines for developing

neural networks have far exceeded the DRAM capacities of modern hardware
accelerators. This has necessitated the development of efficient algorithms to
train these neural networks in parallel on large-scale GPU-based clusters.
Since computation is relatively inexpensive on modern GPUs, designing and
implementing extremely efficient communication in these parallel training
algorithms is critical for extracting the maximum performance. This paper
presents AxoNN, a parallel deep learning framework that exploits asynchrony and
message-driven execution to schedule neural network operations on each GPU,
thereby reducing GPU idle time and maximizing hardware efficiency. By using the
CPU memory as a scratch space for offloading data periodically during training,
AxoNN is able to reduce GPU memory consumption by four times. This allows us to
increase the number of parameters per GPU by four times, thus reducing the
amount of communication and increasing performance by over 13%. When tested
against large transformer models with 12-100 billion parameters on 48-384
NVIDIA Tesla V100 GPUs, AxoNN achieves a per-GPU throughput of 49.4-54.78% of
theoretical peak and reduces the training time by 22-37 days (15-25% speedup)
as compared to the state-of-the-art.]]></summary>

distributions are the same. To this end, a key requirement is to develop models
that can generalize to unseen distributions. Domain generalization (DG), i.e.,
out-of-distribution generalization, has attracted increasing interests in
recent years. Domain generalization deals with a challenging setting where one
or several different but related domain(s) are given, and the goal is to learn
a model that can generalize to an unseen test domain. Great progress has been
made in the area of domain generalization for years. This paper presents the
first review of recent advances in this area. First, we provide a formal
definition of domain generalization and discuss several related fields. We then
thoroughly review the theories related to domain generalization and carefully
analyze the theory behind generalization. We categorize recent algorithms into
three classes: data manipulation, representation learning, and learning
strategy, and present several popular algorithms in detail for each category.
Third, we introduce the commonly used datasets, applications, and our
open-sourced codebase for fair evaluation. Finally, we summarize existing

which has made consistent progress due to the development of computer vision
and natural language generation techniques. Though conventional captioning
models achieve high accuracy based on popular metrics, i.e., BLEU, CIDEr, and
SPICE, the ability of captions to distinguish the target image from other
similar images is under-explored. To generate distinctive captions, a few
pioneers employ contrastive learning or re-weighted the ground-truth captions,
which focuses on one single input image. However, the relationships between
objects in a similar image group (e.g., items or properties within the same
album or fine-grained events) are neglected. In this paper, we improve the
distinctiveness of image captions using a Group-based Distinctive Captioning
Model (GdisCap), which compares each image with other images in one similar
group and highlights the uniqueness of each image. In particular, we propose a
group-based memory attention (GMA) module, which stores object features that
are unique among the image group (i.e., with low similarity to objects in other
images). These unique object features are highlighted when generating captions,
resulting in more distinctive captions. Furthermore, the distinctive words in
the ground-truth captions are selected to supervise the language decoder and
GMA. Finally, we propose a new evaluation metric, distinctive word rate
(DisWordRate) to measure the distinctiveness of captions. Quantitative results
indicate that the proposed method significantly improves the distinctiveness of
several baseline models, and achieves the state-of-the-art performance on both
accuracy and distinctiveness. Results of a user study agree with the
quantitative evaluation and demonstrate the rationality of the new metric
DisWordRate.]]></summary>

data to extract useful latent representations replacing traditional input
features in the downstream task. In audio/speech signal processing, a wide
range of features where engineered through decades of research efforts. As it
turns out, learning to predict such features (a.k.a pseudo-labels) has proven
to be a particularly relevant pretext task, leading to useful self-supervised
representations which prove to be effective for downstream tasks. However,
methods and common practices for combining such pretext tasks for better
performance on the downstream task have not been explored and understood
properly. In fact, the process relies almost exclusively on a computationally
heavy experimental procedure, which becomes intractable with the increase of
the number of pretext tasks. This paper introduces a method to select a group
of pretext tasks among a set of candidates. The method we propose estimates
calibrated weights for the partial losses corresponding to the considered
pretext tasks during the self-supervised training process. The experiments
conducted on automatic speech recognition, speaker and emotion recognition
validate our approach, as the groups selected and weighted with our method
perform better than classic baselines, thus facilitating the selection and

remains a major challenge of machine learning, which has impeded its wide
deployment to many scenarios. Recent advances reveal that a properly
pre-trained model endows an important property: transferability. A higher
transferability of the learned representations indicates a better
generalizability across domains of different distributions (domain
transferability), or across tasks of different semantics (task
transferability). Transferability has become the key to enable data-efficient
deep learning, however, existing pre-training methods focus only on domain
transferability while meta-training methods only on task transferability. This
restricts their data-efficiency in downstream scenarios of diverging domains
and tasks. A finding of this paper is that even a tight combination of
pre-training and meta-training cannot achieve both kinds of transferability.
This motivates the proposed Omni-Training framework towards data-efficient deep
learning. Our first contribution is Omni-Net, a tri-flow architecture. Besides
the joint representation flow, Omni-Net introduces two new parallel flows for
pre-training and meta-training, respectively responsible for learning
representations of domain transferability and task transferability. Omni-Net
coordinates the parallel flows by routing them via the joint-flow, making each
gain the other kind of transferability. Our second contribution is Omni-Loss,
in which a self-distillation regularization is imposed to enable knowledge
transfer across the training process. Omni-Training is a general framework that
accommodates many existing pre-training and meta-training algorithms. A
thorough evaluation on cross-task and cross-domain datasets in classification,
regression and reinforcement learning problems shows that Omni-Training
consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art methods.]]></summary>

is non-trivial, especially in offline settings, as there is a potential large

errors in estimating the value of safety constraints. We show that na\"ive

quickly learn new ones. They are trained on benchmarks with a fixed number of
data points per task. This number is usually arbitrary and it is unknown how it
affects performance at testing. Since labelling of data is expensive, finding
the optimal allocation of labels across training tasks may reduce costs. Given
a fixed budget of labels, should we use a small number of highly labelled
tasks, or many tasks with few labels each? Should we allocate more labels to
some tasks and less to others? We show that: 1) If tasks are homogeneous, there
is a uniform optimal allocation, whereby all tasks get the same amount of data;
2) At fixed budget, there is a trade-off between number of tasks and number of
data points per task, with a unique solution for the optimum; 3) When trained
separately, harder task should get more data, at the cost of a smaller number
of tasks; 4) When training on a mixture of easy and hard tasks, more data
should be allocated to easy tasks. Interestingly, Neuroscience experiments have
shown that human visual skills also transfer better from easy tasks. We prove
these results mathematically on mixed linear regression, and we show
empirically that the same results hold for few-shot image classification on
CIFAR-FS and mini-ImageNet. Our results provide guidance for allocating labels

that can help combat echo chambers and political polarization. Previous
approaches generally focus on leveraging textual content to identify stances,
while they fail to reason with background knowledge or leverage the rich
semantic and syntactic textual labels in news articles. In light of these
limitations, we propose KCD, a political perspective detection approach to
enable multi-hop knowledge reasoning and incorporate textual cues as
paragraph-level labels. Specifically, we firstly generate random walks on
external knowledge graphs and infuse them with news text representations. We
then construct a heterogeneous information network to jointly model news
content as well as semantic, syntactic and entity cues in news articles.
Finally, we adopt relational graph neural networks for graph-level
representation learning and conduct political perspective detection. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods
on two benchmark datasets. We further examine the effect of knowledge walks and
textual cues and how they contribute to our approach's data efficiency.]]></summary>

prediction of vessel berth stay has been triggered for requirements of
operation research and scheduling optimization problem in the era of maritime
big data, which takes a significant part in port efficiency and maritime
logistics enhancement. This study proposes a systematic and dynamic approach of
predicting berth stay for tanker terminals. The approach covers three
innovative aspects: 1) Data source employed is multi-faceted, including cargo
operation data from tanker terminals, time-series data from automatic
identification system (AIS), etc. 2) The process of berth stay is decomposed
into multiple blocks according to data analysis and information extraction
innovatively, and practical operation scenarios are also developed accordingly.
3) The predictive models of berth stay are developed on the basis of prior data
analysis and information extraction under two methods, including regression and
decomposed distribution. The models are evaluated under four dynamic scenarios
with certain designated cargoes among two different terminals. The evaluation
results show that the proposed approach can predict berth stay with the
accuracy up to 98.81% validated by historical baselines, and also demonstrate
the proposed approach has dynamic capability of predicting berth stay among the
scenarios. The model may be potentially applied for short-term pilot-booking or
scheduling optimizations within a reasonable time frame for advancement of port

learning (FedGG), which introduces a model-cosine loss into local objective
functions, so that local models can fit local data distributions under the
guidance of update directions of global models. Furthermore, considering that
the update direction of a global model is informative in the early stage of
training, we propose adaptive loss weights based on the update distances of
local models. Numerical simulations show that, compared with other advanced
algorithms, FedGG has a significant improvement on model convergence accuracies

adaptive loss weights enable our algorithm to be more stable and easier to

verification, identification, and diarization. Inarguably, a significant part
of this success is due to the demonstrated effectiveness of their speaker
representations. These, however, are heavily dependent on large amounts of
annotated data and can be sensitive to new domains. This study proposes an
entirely unsupervised deep-learning model for speaker diarization.
Specifically, the study focuses on generating high-quality neural speaker
representations without any annotated data, as well as on estimating secondary
hyperparameters of the model without annotations.

The speaker embeddings are represented by an encoder trained in a
self-supervised fashion using pairs of adjacent segments assumed to be of the
same speaker. The trained encoder model is then used to self-generate
pseudo-labels to subsequently train a similarity score between different
segments of the same call using probabilistic linear discriminant analysis
(PLDA) and further to learn a clustering stopping threshold. We compared our
model to state-of-the-art unsupervised as well as supervised baselines on the
CallHome benchmarks. According to empirical results, our approach outperforms
unsupervised methods when only two speakers are present in the call, and is
only slightly worse than recent supervised models.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[One intriguing property of adversarial attacks is their "transferability" --
an adversarial example crafted with respect to one deep neural network (DNN)
model is often found effective against other DNNs as well. Intensive research
has been conducted on this phenomenon under simplistic controlled conditions.
Yet, thus far, there is still a lack of comprehensive understanding about
transferability-based attacks ("transfer attacks") in real-world environments.

To bridge this critical gap, we conduct the first large-scale systematic
empirical study of transfer attacks against major cloud-based MLaaS platforms,
taking the components of a real transfer attack into account. The study leads
to a number of interesting findings which are inconsistent to the existing
ones, including: (1) Simple surrogates do not necessarily improve real transfer
attacks. (2) No dominant surrogate architecture is found in real transfer
attacks. (3) It is the gap between posterior (output of the softmax layer)
rather than the gap between logit (so-called $\kappa$ value) that increases
transferability. Moreover, by comparing with prior works, we demonstrate that
transfer attacks possess many previously unknown properties in real-world
environments, such as (1) Model similarity is not a well-defined concept. (2)
$L_2$ norm of perturbation can generate high transferability without usage of
gradient and is a more powerful source than $L_\infty$ norm. We believe this
work sheds light on the vulnerabilities of popular MLaaS platforms and points
to a few promising research directions.]]></summary>

they have been lucrative targets for cyber attackers. These critical
infrastructures are usually Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) such as power grids,
water, and sewage treatment facilities, oil and gas pipelines, etc. In recent
times, these systems have suffered from cyber attacks numerous times.
Researchers have been developing cyber security solutions for CIs to avoid
lasting damages. According to standard frameworks, cyber security based on
identification, protection, detection, response, and recovery are at the core
of these research. Detection of an ongoing attack that escapes standard
protection such as firewall, anti-virus, and host/network intrusion detection
has gained importance as such attacks eventually affect the physical dynamics
of the system. Therefore, anomaly detection in physical dynamics proves an
effective means to implement defense-in-depth. PASAD is one example of anomaly
detection in the sensor/actuator data, representing such systems' physical
dynamics. We present EPASAD, which improves the detection technique used in
PASAD to detect these micro-stealthy attacks, as our experiments show that
PASAD's spherical boundary-based detection fails to detect. Our method EPASAD
overcomes this by using Ellipsoid boundaries, thereby tightening the boundaries
in various dimensions, whereas a spherical boundary treats all dimensions
equally. We validate EPASAD using the dataset produced by the TE-process
simulator and the C-town datasets. The results show that EPASAD improves
PASAD's average recall by 5.8% and 9.5% for the two datasets, respectively.]]></summary>

tremendous success in multiple domains. Given a specific task, developers can
collect massive DNNs from public sources for efficient reusing and avoid
redundant work from scratch. However, testing the performance (e.g., accuracy
and robustness) of multiple DNNs and giving a reasonable recommendation that
which model should be used is challenging regarding the scarcity of labeled
data and demand of domain expertise. Existing testing approaches are mainly
selection-based where after sampling, a few of the test data are labeled to
discriminate DNNs. Therefore, due to the randomness of sampling, the
performance ranking is not deterministic. In this paper, we propose a
labeling-free comparison testing approach to overcome the limitations of
labeling effort and sampling randomness. The main idea is to learn a Bayesian
model to infer the models' specialty only based on predicted labels. To
evaluate the effectiveness of our approach, we undertook exhaustive experiments
on 9 benchmark datasets spanning in the domains of image, text, and source
code, and 165 DNNs. In addition to accuracy, we consider the robustness against
synthetic and natural distribution shifts. The experimental results demonstrate
that the performance of existing approaches degrades under distribution shifts.
Our approach outperforms the baseline methods by up to 0.74 and 0.53 on
Spearman's correlation and Kendall's $\tau$, respectively, regardless of the
dataset and distribution shift. Additionally, we investigated the impact of
model quality (accuracy and robustness) and diversity (standard deviation of
the quality) on the testing effectiveness and observe that there is a higher
chance of a good result when the quality is over 50\% and the diversity is
larger than 18\%.]]></summary>

different subjects and present important advantages compared to other biometric
traits, such as difficulty to counterfeit, liveness detection, and ubiquity.
Also, with the success of Deep Learning technologies, ECG biometric recognition
has received increasing interest in recent years. However, it is not easy to
evaluate the improvements of novel ECG proposed methods, mainly due to the lack
of public data and standard experimental protocols. In this study, we perform
extensive analysis and comparison of different scenarios in ECG biometric
recognition. Both verification and identification tasks are investigated, as
well as single- and multi-session scenarios. Finally, we also perform single-
and multi-lead ECG experiments, considering traditional scenarios using
electrodes in the chest and limbs and current user-friendly wearable devices.

In addition, we present ECGXtractor, a robust Deep Learning technology
trained with an in-house large-scale database and able to operate successfully
across various scenarios and multiple databases. We introduce our proposed
feature extractor, trained with multiple sinus-rhythm heartbeats belonging to
55,967 subjects, and provide a general public benchmark evaluation with
detailed experimental protocol. We evaluate the system performance over four
different databases: i) our in-house database, ii) PTB, iii) ECG-ID, and iv)
CYBHi. With the widely used PTB database, we achieve Equal Error Rates of 0.14%
and 2.06% in verification, and accuracies of 100% and 96.46% in identification,
respectively in single- and multi-session analysis. We release the source code,
experimental protocol details, and pre-trained models in GitHub to advance in
the field.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As clean ImageNet accuracy nears its ceiling, the research community is
increasingly more concerned about robust accuracy under distributional shifts.
While a variety of methods have been proposed to robustify neural networks,
these techniques often target models trained on ImageNet classification. At the
same time, it is a common practice to use ImageNet pretrained backbones for
downstream tasks such as object detection, semantic segmentation, and image
classification from different domains. This raises a question: Can these robust
image classifiers transfer robustness to downstream tasks? For object detection
and semantic segmentation, we find that a vanilla Swin Transformer, a variant
of Vision Transformer tailored for dense prediction tasks, transfers robustness
better than Convolutional Neural Networks that are trained to be robust to the
corrupted version of ImageNet. For CIFAR10 classification, we find that models
that are robustified for ImageNet do not retain robustness when fully
fine-tuned. These findings suggest that current robustification techniques tend
to emphasize ImageNet evaluations. Moreover, network architecture is a strong
source of robustness when we consider transfer learning.]]></summary>

human history and helps tell the worlds story. As a result of the Fourth
Industrial Revolution, the Internet has become an increasingly important source
of fashion information. However, with a growing number of web pages and social
data, it is nearly impossible for humans to manually catch up with the ongoing
evolution and the continuously variable content in this domain. The proper
management and exploitation of big data can pave the way for the substantial
growth of the global economy as well as citizen satisfaction. Therefore,
computer scientists have found it challenging to handle e-commerce fashion
websites by using big data and machine learning technologies. This paper first
proposes a scalable focused Web Crawler engine based on the distributed
computing platforms to extract and process fashion data on e-commerce websites.
The role of the proposed platform is then described in developing a
disentangled feature extraction method by employing deep convolutional
generative adversarial networks (DCGANs) for content-based image indexing and
retrieval. Finally, the state-of-the-art solutions are compared, and the
results of the proposed approach are analyzed on a standard dataset. For the
real-life implementation of the proposed solution, a Web-based application is
developed on Apache Storm, Kafka, Solr, and Milvus platforms to create a
fashion search engine called SnapMode.]]></summary>

single sensor measurements. We predict the vehicle's pass-by instant by
minimizing clipped vehicle-to-microphone distance, which is predicted from the

mel-spectrogram-based features are used directly for vehicle speed estimation,
without introducing any intermediate features. The results show that the
proposed features can be used for accurate vehicle detection and speed

the proposed method attains the average accuracy of 48.7% for correct class

equilibria (CCE) in general-sum stochastic games is computationally
intractable, even when there are two players, the game is turn-based, the
discount factor is an absolute constant, and the approximation is an absolute
constant. Our intractability results stand in sharp contrast to normal-form
games where exact CCEs are efficiently computable. A fortiori, our results
imply that there are no efficient algorithms for learning stationary Markov CCE
policies in multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL), even when the
interaction is two-player and turn-based, and both the discount factor and the
desired approximation of the learned policies is an absolute constant. In turn,
these results stand in sharp contrast to single-agent reinforcement learning
(RL) where near-optimal stationary Markov policies can be efficiently learned.
Complementing our intractability results for stationary Markov CCEs, we provide
a decentralized algorithm (assuming shared randomness among players) for
learning a nonstationary Markov CCE policy with polynomial time and sample
complexity in all problem parameters. Previous work for learning Markov CCE
policies all required exponential time and sample complexity in the number of

single optimal solution, finding a diverse set of near-optimal solutions can
often be more useful. State of the art methods for generating diverse
near-optimal solutions usually take a two-phase approach, first finding a set
of near-optimal solutions and then finding a diverse subset. In contrast, we
present a method of finding a set of diverse solutions by emphasizing diversity
within the search for near-optimal solutions. Specifically, within a
branch-and-bound framework, we investigate parameterized node selection rules
that explicitly consider diversity. Our results indicate that our approach
significantly increases diversity of the final solution set. When compared with
existing methods for finding diverse near-optimal sets, our method runs with
similar run-time as regular node selection methods and gives a diversity
improvement of up to 140%. In contrast, popular node selection rules such as
best-first search gives an improvement of no more than 40%. Further, we find
that our method is most effective when diversity is emphasized more in node
selection when deeper in the tree and when the solution set has grown large

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Recently, it is shown that shuffling can amplify the central differential
privacy guarantees of data randomized with local differential privacy. Within
this setup, a centralized, trusted shuffler is responsible for shuffling by
keeping the identities of data anonymous, which subsequently leads to stronger
privacy guarantees for systems. However, introducing a centralized entity to
the originally local privacy model loses some appeals of not having any
centralized entity as in local differential privacy. Moreover, implementing a
shuffler in a reliable way is not trivial due to known security issues and/or
requirements of advanced hardware or secure computation technology.

Motivated by these practical considerations, we rethink the shuffle model to
relax the assumption of requiring a centralized, trusted shuffler. We introduce
network shuffling, a decentralized mechanism where users exchange data in a
random-walk fashion on a network/graph, as an alternative of achieving privacy
amplification via anonymity. We analyze the threat model under such a setting,
and propose distributed protocols of network shuffling that is straightforward
to implement in practice. Furthermore, we show that the privacy amplification
rate is similar to other privacy amplification techniques such as uniform
shuffling. To our best knowledge, among the recently studied intermediate trust
models that leverage privacy amplification techniques, our work is the first
that is not relying on any centralized entity to achieve privacy amplification.]]></summary>

on the use of neuroimaging data such as magnetic resonance imaging and clinical
laboratory tests for disease identification. However, studies have shown that
these modalities are not consistent with disease activity such as symptoms or
disease progression. Furthermore, the cost of collecting data from these
modalities is high, leading to scarce evaluations. In this work, we used
multi-dimensional, affordable, physical and smartphone-based performance
outcome measures (POM) in conjunction with demographic data to predict multiple
sclerosis disease progression. We performed a rigorous benchmarking exercise on
two datasets and present results across 13 clinically actionable prediction
endpoints and 6 machine learning models. To the best of our knowledge, our
results are the first to show that it is possible to predict disease
progression using POMs and demographic data in the context of both clinical
trials and smartphone-base studies by using two datasets. Moreover, we
investigate our models to understand the impact of different POMs and
demographics on model performance through feature ablation studies. We also
show that model performance is similar across different demographic subgroups
(based on age and sex). To enable this work, we developed an end-to-end
reusable pre-processing and machine learning framework which allows quicker

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Due to the cost or interference of measurement, we need to control
measurement system. Assuming that each variable can be measured sequentially,
there exists optimal policy choosing next measurement for the former
observations. Though optimal measurement policy is actually dependent on the
goal of measurement, we mainly focus on retrieving complete data, so called as
imputation. Also, we adapt the imputation method to missingness varying with
measurement policy. However, learning measurement policy and imputation
requires complete data which is impossible to be observed, unfortunately. To
tackle this problem, we propose a data generation method and joint learning
algorithm. The main idea is that 1) the data generation method is inherited by
imputation method, and 2) the adaptation of imputation encourages measurement
policy to learn more than individual learning. We implemented some variations
of proposed algorithm for two different datasets and various missing rates.
From the experimental results, we demonstrate that our algorithm is generally
applicable and outperforms baseline methods.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Federated learning (FL) is a distributed learning paradigm that enables
multiple clients to collaboratively learn a shared global model. Despite the
recent progress, it remains challenging to deal with heterogeneous data
clients, as the discrepant data distributions usually prevent the global model
from delivering good generalization ability on each participating client. In
this paper, we propose CD^2-pFed, a novel Cyclic Distillation-guided Channel
Decoupling framework, to personalize the global model in FL, under various
settings of data heterogeneity. Different from previous works which establish
layer-wise personalization to overcome the non-IID data across different
clients, we make the first attempt at channel-wise assignment for model
personalization, referred to as channel decoupling. To further facilitate the
collaboration between private and shared weights, we propose a novel cyclic
distillation scheme to impose a consistent regularization between the local and
global model representations during the federation. Guided by the cyclical
distillation, our channel decoupling framework can deliver more accurate and
generalized results for different kinds of heterogeneity, such as feature skew,
label distribution skew, and concept shift. Comprehensive experiments on four
benchmarks, including natural image and medical image analysis tasks,
demonstrate the consistent effectiveness of our method on both local and
external validations.]]></summary>

patients suffering from pathological speech disorders. Automatic and objective
measures are desirable to assist therapists in their traditionally subjective
and labor-intensive assessments. In this work, we investigate a novel approach
for obtaining such a measure using the divergence in disentangled latent speech
representations of a parallel utterance pair, obtained from a healthy reference
and a pathological speaker. Experiments on an English database of Cerebral
Palsy patients, using all available utterances per speaker, show high and
significant correlation values (R = -0.9) with subjective intelligibility
measures, while having only minimal deviation (+-0.01) across four different
reference speaker pairs. We also demonstrate the robustness of the proposed
method (R = -0.89 deviating +-0.02 over 1000 iterations) by considering a
significantly smaller amount of utterances per speaker. Our results are among
the first to show that disentangled speech representations can be used for
automatic pathological speech intelligibility assessment, resulting in a
reference speaker pair invariant method, applicable in scenarios with only few
utterances available.]]></summary>

models is receiving growing attention. State-of-the-art strategies address the
problem as a supervised learning task and optimize algorithms that predict
subgrid fluxes based on information from coarse resolution models. In practice,
training data are generated from higher resolution numerical simulations
transformed in order to mimic coarse resolution simulations. By essence, these
strategies optimize subgrid parametrizations to meet so-called $\textit{a
priori}$ criteria. But the actual purpose of a subgrid parametrization is to
obtain good performance in terms of $\textit{a posteriori}$ metrics which imply
computing entire model trajectories. In this paper, we focus on the
representation of energy backscatter in two dimensional quasi-geostrophic
turbulence and compare parametrizations obtained with different learning
strategies at fixed computational complexity. We show that strategies based on
$\textit{a priori}$ criteria yield parametrizations that tend to be unstable in
direct simulations and describe how subgrid parametrizations can alternatively
be trained end-to-end in order to meet $\textit{a posteriori}$ criteria. We
illustrate that end-to-end learning strategies yield parametrizations that
outperform known empirical and data-driven schemes in terms of performance,
stability and ability to apply to different flow configurations. These results
support the relevance of differentiable programming paradigms for climate

where each training example is associated with a set of candidate labels among
which only one is true. Most existing PLL approaches assume that the incorrect
labels in each training example are randomly picked as the candidate labels and
model the generation process of the candidate labels in a simple way. However,
these approaches usually do not perform as well as expected due to the fact
that the generation process of the candidate labels is always
instance-dependent. Therefore, it deserves to be modeled in a refined way. In
this paper, we consider instance-dependent PLL and assume that the generation
process of the candidate labels could decompose into two sequential parts,
where the correct label emerges first in the mind of the annotator but then the
incorrect labels related to the feature are also selected with the correct
label as candidate labels due to uncertainty of labeling. Motivated by this
consideration, we propose a novel PLL method that performs Maximum A
Posterior(MAP) based on an explicitly modeled generation process of candidate
labels via decomposed probability distribution models. Experiments on benchmark

algorithm. Deployment of $Q$-learning requires approximation of the

provide online random forests as $Q$-function approximators and propose a novel
method wherein the random forest is grown as learning proceeds (through
expanding forests). We demonstrate improved performance of our methods over
state-of-the-art Deep $Q$-Networks in two OpenAI gyms (`blackjack' and
`inverted pendulum') but not in the `lunar lander' gym. We suspect that the
resilience to overfitting enjoyed by random forests recommends our method for
common tasks that do not require a strong representation of the problem domain.
We show that expanding forests (in which the number of trees increases as data

growth in recent years, largely due to the increasing popularity of personal
assistant features on mobile devices and smart home speakers. In this work, we
present Personal VAD 2.0, a personalized voice activity detector that detects
the voice activity of a target speaker, as part of a streaming on-device ASR
system. Although previous proof-of-concept studies have validated the
effectiveness of Personal VAD, there are still several critical challenges to
address before this model can be used in production: first, the quality must be
satisfactory in both enrollment and enrollment-less scenarios; second, it
should operate in a streaming fashion; and finally, the model size should be
small enough to fit a limited latency and CPU/Memory budget. To meet the
multi-faceted requirements, we propose a series of novel designs: 1) advanced
speaker embedding modulation methods; 2) a new training paradigm to generalize
to enrollment-less conditions; 3) architecture and runtime optimizations for
latency and resource restrictions. Extensive experiments on a realistic speech
recognition system demonstrated the state-of-the-art performance of our

the exact free energy evaluation is computationally infeasible because it

which is similar to a simulated annealing, and can effectively approximate the

streams. Many algorithms recently proposed in the literature tackle this
problem using a variety of data-level, algorithm-level, and ensemble
approaches. However, there is a lack of standardized and agreed-upon procedures
on how to evaluate these algorithms. This work presents a taxonomy of
algorithms for imbalanced data streams and proposes a standardized, exhaustive,
and informative experimental testbed to evaluate algorithms in a collection of
diverse and challenging imbalanced data stream scenarios. The experimental
study evaluates 24 state-of-the-art data streams algorithms on 515 imbalanced
data streams that combine static and dynamic class imbalance ratios,
instance-level difficulties, concept drift, real-world and semi-synthetic
datasets in binary and multi-class scenarios. This leads to the largest
experimental study conducted so far in the data stream mining domain. We
discuss the advantages and disadvantages of state-of-the-art classifiers in
each of these scenarios and we provide general recommendations to end-users for
selecting the best algorithms for imbalanced data streams. Additionally, we
formulate open challenges and future directions for this domain. Our
experimental testbed is fully reproducible and easy to extend with new methods.
This way we propose the first standardized approach to conducting experiments
in imbalanced data streams that can be used by other researchers to create
trustworthy and fair evaluation of newly proposed methods. Our experimental

learning (FL), in which model training is conducted by the data-collecting
devices. Existing research on FL has mostly focused on a star topology learning
architecture with synchronized (time-triggered) model training rounds, where
the local models of the devices are periodically aggregated by a centralized
coordinating node. However, in many settings, such a coordinating node may not
exist, motivating efforts to fully decentralize FL. In this work, we propose a
novel methodology for distributed model aggregations via asynchronous,
event-triggered consensus iterations over the network graph topology. We
consider heterogeneous communication event thresholds at each device that weigh
the change in local model parameters against the available local resources in
deciding the benefit of aggregations at each iteration. Through theoretical
analysis, we demonstrate that our methodology achieves asymptotic convergence
to the globally optimal learning model under standard assumptions in
distributed learning and graph consensus literature, and without restrictive
connectivity requirements on the underlying topology. Subsequent numerical
results demonstrate that our methodology obtains substantial improvements in
communication requirements compared with FL baselines.]]></summary>

over Electrocardiogram (ECG) signal is a challenging task for both humans and
machines. The main reason is the significant variations of both normal and
arrhythmic ECG patterns among patients. Automating this process with utmost
accuracy is, therefore, highly desirable due to the advent of wearable ECG
sensors. However, even with numerous deep learning approaches proposed
recently, there is still a notable gap in the performance of global and
patient-specific ECG classification performances. This study proposes a novel
approach to narrow this gap and propose a real-time solution with shallow and
compact 1D Self-Organized Operational Neural Networks (Self-ONNs). Methods: In
this study, we propose a novel approach for inter-patient ECG classification
using a compact 1D Self-ONN by exploiting morphological and timing information
in heart cycles. We used 1D Self-ONN layers to automatically learn
morphological representations from ECG data, enabling us to capture the shape
of the ECG waveform around the R peaks. We further inject temporal features
based on RR interval for timing characterization. The classification layers can
thus benefit from both temporal and learned features for the final arrhythmia
classification. Results: Using the MIT-BIH arrhythmia benchmark database, the
proposed method achieves the highest classification performance ever achieved,
i.e., 99.21% precision, 99.10% recall, and 99.15% F1-score for normal (N)
segments; 82.19% precision, 82.50% recall, and 82.34% F1-score for the
supra-ventricular ectopic beat (SVEBs); and finally, 94.41% precision, 96.10%
recall, and 95.2% F1-score for the ventricular-ectopic beats (VEBs).]]></summary>

combining previous hand-made methods through genetic programming and fuzzy
logic. The other approach consists of improving the inner computational
structures of basic hand-made models through artificial evolution. This
research work proposes expanding the artificial dorsal stream using a recent
proposal to solve salient object detection problems. This approach uses the
benefits of the two main aspects of this research area: fixation prediction and
detection of salient objects. We decided to apply the fusion of visual saliency

by decomposing it into smaller and more familiar subtasks. While it is
difficult to measure whether neural program synthesis methods have similar
capabilities, what we can measure is whether they compositionally generalize,
that is, whether a model that has been trained on the simpler subtasks is
subsequently able to solve more complex tasks. In this paper, we focus on
measuring the ability of learned program synthesizers to compositionally
generalize. We first characterize several different axes along which program
synthesis methods would be desired to generalize, e.g., length generalization,
or the ability to combine known subroutines in new ways that do not occur in
the training data. Based on this characterization, we introduce a benchmark
suite of tasks to assess these abilities based on two popular existing
datasets, SCAN and RobustFill. Finally, we make first attempts to improve the
compositional generalization ability of Transformer models along these axes
through novel attention mechanisms that draw inspiration from a human-like
decomposition strategy. Empirically, we find our modified Transformer models
generally perform better than natural baselines, but the tasks remain
challenging.]]></summary>

dimensions non-invasively, with applications in biomedical imaging, materials
science, electronic inspection, and other fields. The reconstruction process
can be an ill-conditioned inverse problem, requiring regularization to obtain
satisfactory reconstructions. Recently, deep learning has been adopted for
tomographic reconstruction. Unlike iterative algorithms which require a
distribution that is known a priori, deep reconstruction networks can learn a
prior distribution through sampling the training distributions. In this work,
we develop a Physics-assisted Generative Adversarial Network (PGAN), a two-step
algorithm for tomographic reconstruction. In contrast to previous efforts, our
PGAN utilizes maximum-likelihood estimates derived from the measurements to
regularize the reconstruction with both known physics and the learned prior.
Synthetic objects with spatial correlations are integrated circuits (IC) from a
proposed model CircuitFaker. Compared with maximum-likelihood estimation, PGAN
can reduce the photon requirement with limited projection angles to achieve a
given error rate. We further attribute the improvement to the learned prior by
reconstructing objects created without spatial correlations. The advantages of
using a prior from deep learning in X-ray tomography may further enable
low-photon nanoscale imaging.]]></summary>

(AMR), as an important task in cognitive radio, has gradually transformed from
traditional feature extraction and classification to automatic classification
by deep learning technology. However, deep learning models are data-driven
methods, which often require a large amount of data as the training support.
Data augmentation, as the strategy of expanding dataset, can improve the
generalization of the deep learning models and thus improve the accuracy of the
models to a certain extent. In this paper, for AMR of radio signals, we propose
a data augmentation strategy based on mixing signals and consider four specific
methods (Random Mixing, Maximum-Similarity-Mixing, $\theta-$Similarity Mixing
and n-times Random Mixing) to achieve data augmentation. Experiments show that
our proposed method can improve the classification accuracy of deep learning
based AMR models in the full public dataset RML2016.10a. In particular, for the
case of a single signal-to-noise ratio signal set, the classification accuracy
can be significantly improved, which verifies the effectiveness of the methods.]]></summary>

a user holding a smartphone. We consider a large location with $M$ number of
grid points, each grid point is labeled with a unique fingerprint consisting of
the received signal strength (RSS) values measured from $N$ number of Bluetooth
Low Energy (BLE) beacons. Given the fingerprint observed by the smartphone, the
user's current location can be estimated by finding the top-k similar
fingerprints from the list of fingerprints registered in the database. Besides
the environmental factors, the dynamicity in holding the smartphone is another
source to the variation in fingerprint measurements, yet there are not many
studies addressing the fingerprint variability due to dynamic smartphone
positions held by human hands during online detection. To this end, we propose
a nonlinear location estimation using the kernel method. Specifically, our
proposed method comprises of two steps: 1) a beacon selection strategy to
select a subset of beacons that is insensitive to the subtle change of holding
positions, and 2) a kernel method to compute the similarity between this subset
of observed signals and all the fingerprints registered in the database. The
experimental results based on large-scale data collected in a complex building
indicate a substantial performance gain of our proposed approach in comparison

with unknown items to a target user. Although the primary goal of traditional
recommendation systems is to deliver the most relevant items, such an effort
unintentionally can cause collateral effects including low diversity and
unbalanced genres or categories, benefiting particular groups of categories.
This paper proposes an approach to create recommendation lists with a
calibrated balance of genres, avoiding disproportion between the user's profile
interests and the recommendation list. The calibrated recommendations consider
concomitantly the relevance and the divergence between the genres distributions
extracted from the user's preference and the recommendation list. The main
claim is that calibration can contribute positively to generate fairer
recommendations. In particular, we propose a new trade-off equation, which
considers the users' bias to provide a recommendation list that seeks for the
users' tendencies. Moreover, we propose a conceptual framework and a decision
protocol to generate more than one thousand combinations of calibrated systems
in order to find the best combination. We compare our approach against
state-of-the-art approaches using multiple domain datasets, which are analyzed
by rank and calibration metrics. The results indicate that the trade-off, which
considers the users' bias, produces positive effects on the precision and to
the fairness, thus generating recommendation lists that respect the genre
distribution and, through the decision protocol, we also found the best system
for each dataset.]]></summary>

can capture loose garments and hair. We implemented a differentiable pipeline
to learn UV mapping between a sequence of RGB inputs and textures via UV
coordinates. Instead of treating the UV coordinates of each frame separately,
our data generation approach connects all UV coordinates via feature matching
for temporal stability. Subsequently, a generative model is trained to balance
the spatial quality and temporal stability. It is driven by supervised and
unsupervised losses in both UV and image spaces. Our experiments show that the
trained models output high-quality UV coordinates and generalize to new poses.
Once a sequence of UV coordinates has been inferred by our model, it can be
used to flexibly synthesize new looks and modified visual styles. Compared to

applications to optimize several tasks in many complex systems. Particularly,
deep learning model for diagnosing and prognosing machinery health has
leveraged predictive maintenance (PdM) to be more accurate and reliable in
decision making, in this way avoiding unnecessary interventions, machinery
accidents, and environment catastrophes. Recently, Transformer Neural Networks
have gained notoriety and have been increasingly the favorite choice for
Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks. Thus, given their recent major
achievements in NLP, this paper proposes the development of an automatic fault
classifier model for predictive maintenance based on a modified version of the
Transformer architecture, namely T4PdM, to identify multiple types of faults in
rotating machinery. Experimental results are developed and presented for the
MaFaulDa and CWRU databases. T4PdM was able to achieve an overall accuracy of
99.98% and 98% for both datasets, respectively. In addition, the performance of
the proposed model is compared to other previously published works. It has
demonstrated the superiority of the model in detecting and classifying faults
in rotating industrial machinery. Therefore, the proposed Transformer-based
model can improve the performance of machinery fault analysis and diagnostic
processes and leverage companies to a new era of the Industry 4.0. In addition,

learning (ML) methods. It is based on large vectors of binary or bipolar

highly efficient implementation for embedded systems like wearables. While fast
implementations have been presented, other constraints have not been considered

for edge computing is. Devices like smartwatches, smart glasses, or even mobile
systems have a restrictive cooling budget due to their limited volume. Although
HDC operations are simple, the vectors are large, resulting in a high number of
CPU operations and thus a heavy load on the entire system potentially causing
temperature violations. In this work, the impact of HDC on the chip's
temperature is investigated for the first time. We measure the temperature and
power consumption of a commercial embedded system and compare HDC with
conventional CNN. We reveal that HDC causes up to 6.8{\deg}C higher
temperatures and leads to up to 47% more CPU throttling. Even when both HDC and
CNN aim for the same throughput (i.e., perform a similar number of

with high sample efficiency in spite of harsh safety constraints. Finally,
using an ablation of different target objectives, we show that it is important

Adaptive-Gravity, for enhancing the robustness of deep neural network
classifiers against adversarial examples. We conceptualize the model
parameters/features associated with each class as a mass characterized by its
centroid location and the spread (standard deviation of the distance) of
features around the centroid. We use the centroid associated with each cluster
to derive an anti-gravity force that pushes the centroids of different classes
away from one another during network training. Then we customized an objective
function that aims to concentrate each class's features toward their
corresponding new centroid, which has been obtained by anti-gravity force. This
methodology results in a larger separation between different masses and reduces
the spread of features around each centroid. As a result, the samples are
pushed away from the space that adversarial examples could be mapped to,
effectively increasing the degree of perturbation needed for making an
adversarial example. We have implemented this training solution as an iterative
method consisting of four steps at each iteration: 1) centroid extraction, 2)
anti-gravity force calculation, 3) centroid relocation, and 4) gravity
training. Gravity's efficiency is evaluated by measuring the corresponding
fooling rates against various attack models, including FGSM, MIM, BIM, and PGD
using LeNet and ResNet110 networks, benchmarked against MNIST and CIFAR10
classification problems. Test results show that Gravity not only functions as a
powerful instrument to robustify a model against state-of-the-art adversarial

with an artificial neural network. We present an intuitive approach where the
optimal model of the likelihood-to-evidence ratio is found by maximizing the
likelihood of simulated data. Within this framework, the connection between the
task of simulation-based inference and mutual information maximization is
clear, and we show how several known methods of posterior estimation relate to
alternative lower bounds to mutual information. These distinct objective
functions aim at the same optimal energy form and therefore can be directly
benchmarked. We compare their accuracy in the inference of model parameters,

such as graphs, texts, or images. Following spherical and hyperbolic spaces,
more general product spaces have been proposed. However, searching for the best
configuration of product space is a resource-intensive procedure, which reduces
the practical applicability of the idea. We generalize the concept of product
space and introduce an overlapping space that does not have the configuration
search problem. The main idea is to allow subsets of coordinates to be shared
between spaces of different types (Euclidean, hyperbolic, spherical). As a
result, parameter optimization automatically learns the optimal configuration.
Additionally, overlapping spaces allow for more compact representations since
their geometry is more complex. Our experiments confirm that overlapping spaces
outperform the competitors in graph embedding tasks. Here, we consider both
distortion setup, where the aim is to preserve distances, and ranking setup,
where the relative order should be preserved. The proposed method effectively
solves the problem and outperforms the competitors in both settings. We also
perform an empirical analysis in a realistic information retrieval task, where
we compare all spaces by incorporating them into DSSM. In this case, the
proposed overlapping space consistently achieves nearly optimal results without
any configuration tuning. This allows for reducing training time, which can be
significant in large-scale applications.]]></summary>

from noisy labels. Among many other reasons, a significant number of existing
solutions rely on access to it. Estimating the transition matrix without using
ground truth labels is a critical and challenging task. When label noise
transition depends on each instance, the problem of identifying the
instance-dependent noise transition matrix becomes substantially more
challenging. Despite recent works proposing solutions for learning from
instance-dependent noisy labels, we lack a unified understanding of when such a
problem remains identifiable, and therefore learnable. This paper seeks to
provide answers to a sequence of related questions: What are the primary
factors that contribute to the identifiability of a noise transition matrix?
Can we explain the observed empirical successes? When a problem is not
identifiable, what can we do to make it so? We will relate our theoretical
findings to the literature and hope to provide guidelines for developing
effective solutions for battling instance-dependent label noise.]]></summary>

only a few entries of a target vector $b\in\mathbb R^n$ and output a near
minimizer to $\min_{x\in\mathbb R^d} \|Ax-b\|$, for a design matrix
$A\in\mathbb R^{n \times d}$ and loss $\|\cdot\|$.

For $p$ norm regression for any $0<p<\infty$, we give an algorithm based on
Lewis weight sampling outputting a $(1+\epsilon)$-approximate solution using
just $\tilde O(d/\epsilon^2)$ queries to $b$ for $p\in(0,1)$,
$\tilde{O}(d/\epsilon)$ queries for $1<p<2$, and
$\tilde{O}(d^{p/2}/\epsilon^p)$ queries for $2<p<\infty$. For $0<p<2$, our
bounds are optimal up to log factors, settling the query complexity for this
range. For $2<p<\infty$, our dependence on $d$ is optimal, while our dependence
on $\epsilon$ is off by at most $\epsilon$, up to log factors. Our result
resolves an open question of [CD21], who gave near optimal bounds for the $1$
norm, but required $d^2/\epsilon^2$ samples for $\ell_p$ regression with
$1<p<2$, and gave no bounds for $2<p<\infty$ or $0<p<1$.

We also give the first total sensitivity bound of
$O(d^{\max\{1,p/2\}}\log^2n)$ for loss functions of degree $p$ polynomial
growth, improving a result of [TMF20]. By combining this with our techniques
for $\ell_p$ regression, we obtain an active regression algorithm making
$\tilde O(d^{1+\max\{1,p/2\}}/\mathrm{poly}(\epsilon))$ queries for such loss
functions, including the Tukey and Huber losses, answering another question of
[CD21]. For the Huber loss, we further improve our bound to $\tilde
O(d^{4-2\sqrt2}/\mathrm{poly}(\epsilon))$ samples. Our sensitivity bounds also
have many applications, including Orlicz norm subspace embeddings, robust
subspace approximation, and dimension reduction for smoothed $p$-norms.

Finally, our active sampling results give the first sublinear time algorithms
for Kronecker product regression under every $p$ norm.]]></summary>

sparse coding problem while also providing uncertainty quantification. The most
popular inference algorithms for SBL exhibit prohibitively large computational
costs for high-dimensional problems due to the need to maintain a large
covariance matrix. To resolve this issue, we introduce a new method for
accelerating SBL inference -- named covariance-free expectation maximization
(CoFEM) -- that avoids explicit computation of the covariance matrix. CoFEM
solves multiple linear systems to obtain unbiased estimates of the posterior
statistics needed by SBL. This is accomplished by exploiting innovations from
numerical linear algebra such as preconditioned conjugate gradient and a
little-known diagonal estimation rule. For a large class of compressed sensing
matrices, we provide theoretical justifications for why our method scales well
in high-dimensional settings. Through simulations, we show that CoFEM can be up
to thousands of times faster than existing baselines without sacrificing coding
accuracy. Through applications to calcium imaging deconvolution and
multi-contrast MRI reconstruction, we show that CoFEM enables SBL to tractably
tackle high-dimensional sparse coding problems of practical interest.]]></summary>

data to extract useful latent representations replacing traditional input
features in the downstream task. In audio/speech signal processing, a wide
range of features where engineered through decades of research efforts. As it
turns out, learning to predict such features (a.k.a pseudo-labels) has proven
to be a particularly relevant pretext task, leading to useful self-supervised
representations which prove to be effective for downstream tasks. However,
methods and common practices for combining such pretext tasks for better
performance on the downstream task have not been explored and understood
properly. In fact, the process relies almost exclusively on a computationally
heavy experimental procedure, which becomes intractable with the increase of
the number of pretext tasks. This paper introduces a method to select a group
of pretext tasks among a set of candidates. The method we propose estimates
calibrated weights for the partial losses corresponding to the considered
pretext tasks during the self-supervised training process. The experiments
conducted on automatic speech recognition, speaker and emotion recognition
validate our approach, as the groups selected and weighted with our method
perform better than classic baselines, thus facilitating the selection and

to learn the distribution over $p(x)$. This problem is natural in its own
right, but is also an important special case of learning deep generative
models, namely pushforwards of Gaussians under two-layer neural networks with
polynomial activations. Understanding the learnability of such generative
models is crucial to understanding why they perform so well in practice.

Our first main result is a polynomial-time algorithm for learning quadratic
transformations of Gaussians in a smoothed setting. Our second main result is a
polynomial-time algorithm for learning constant-degree polynomial
transformations of Gaussian in a smoothed setting, when the rank of the
associated tensors is small. In fact our results extend to any

vector so that graphs of the same class are close while those of different
classes are mapped far apart. Once graphs are well-separated based on labels, a
classifier is trained to distinguish between different classes. This method is
generic in the sense that it is compatible with any GNN model. By adapting five

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The success and popularity of deep learning is on the rise, partially due to
powerful deep learning frameworks such as TensorFlow and PyTorch that make it
easier to develop deep learning models. However, these libraries also come with
steep learning curves, since programming in these frameworks is quite different
from traditional imperative programming with explicit loops and conditionals.
In this work, we present a tool called TF-Coder for programming by example in
TensorFlow. TF-Coder uses a bottom-up weighted enumerative search, with
value-based pruning of equivalent expressions and flexible type- and
value-based filtering to ensure that expressions adhere to various requirements
imposed by the TensorFlow library. We train models to predict TensorFlow
operations from features of the input and output tensors and natural language
descriptions of tasks, to prioritize relevant operations during search.
TF-Coder solves 63 of 70 real-world tasks within 5 minutes, sometimes finding
simpler solutions in less time compared to experienced human programmers.]]></summary>

ranging from a fast, approximate linear bootstrap tailored to sparse, massive
graphs to a quadratic bootstrap procedure that offers refined accuracy for
smaller, denser graphs. For the fast, approximate linear bootstrap, we show
that $\sqrt{n}$-consistent inference of the count functional is attainable in
certain computational regimes that depend on the sparsity level of the graph.
Furthermore, even in more challenging regimes, we prove that our bootstrap
procedure offers valid coverage and vanishing confidence intervals. For the
quadratic bootstrap, we establish an Edgeworth expansion and show that this
procedure offers higher-order accuracy under appropriate sparsity conditions.
We complement our theoretical results with a simulation study and real data

significant issue in various fields of physics and machine learning. However,
the exact free energy evaluation is computationally infeasible because it

is a type of importance sampling based on the Markov chain Monte Carlo method,
which is similar to a simulated annealing, and can effectively approximate the
free energy. This study proposes a new AIS-based approach, referred to as
marginalized AIS (mAIS). The statistical efficiency of mAIS is investigated in

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Background: Selecting feature genes to predict phenotypes is one of the
typical tasks in analyzing genomics data. Though many general-purpose
algorithms were developed for prediction, dealing with highly correlated genes
in the prediction model is still not well addressed. High correlation among
genes introduces technical problems, such as multi-collinearity issues, leading
to unreliable prediction models. Furthermore, when a causal gene (whose
variants have an actual biological effect on a phenotype) is highly correlated
with other genes, most algorithms select the feature gene from the correlated
group in a purely data-driven manner. Since the correlation structure among
genes could change substantially when condition changes, the prediction model
based on not correctly selected feature genes is unreliable. Therefore, we aim
to keep the causal biological signal in the prediction process and build a more
robust prediction model.

Method: We propose a grouping algorithm, which treats highly correlated genes
as a group and uses their common pattern to represent the group's biological
signal in feature selection. Our novel grouping algorithm can be integrated
into existing prediction algorithms to enhance their prediction performance.
Our proposed grouping method has two advantages. First, using the gene group's
common patterns makes the prediction more robust and reliable under condition
change. Second, it reports whole correlated gene groups as discovered
biomarkers for prediction tasks, allowing researchers to conduct follow-up
studies to identify causal genes within the identified groups.

Result: Using real benchmark scRNA-seq datasets with simulated cell
phenotypes, we demonstrate our novel method significantly outperforms standard
models in both (1) prediction of cell phenotypes and (2) feature gene
selection.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In the graph matching problem we observe two graphs $G,H$ and the goal is to
find an assignment (or matching) between their vertices such that some measure
of edge agreement is maximized. We assume in this work that the observed pair
$G,H$ has been drawn from the correlated Wigner model -- a popular model for
correlated weighted graphs -- where the entries of the adjacency matrices of
$G$ and $H$ are independent Gaussians and each edge of $G$ is correlated with
one edge of $H$ (determined by the unknown matching) with the edge correlation
described by a parameter $\sigma\in [0,1)$. In this paper, we analyse the
performance of the projected power method (PPM) as a seeded graph matching
algorithm where we are given an initial partially correct matching (called the
seed) as side information. We prove that if the seed is close enough to the
ground-truth matching, then with high probability, PPM iteratively improves the
seed and recovers the ground-truth matching (either partially or exactly) in
$\mathcal{O}(\log n)$ iterations. Our results prove that PPM works even in
regimes of constant $\sigma$, thus extending the analysis in (Mao et al.,2021)
for the sparse Erd\"os-Renyi model to the (dense) Wigner model. As a byproduct
of our analysis, we see that the PPM framework generalizes some of the
state-of-art algorithms for seeded graph matching. We support and complement
our theoretical findings with numerical experiments on synthetic data.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In the field of artificial intelligence, reinforcement learning is a type of machine-learning strategy that rewards desirable behaviors while penalizing those which aren’t. An agent can perceive its surroundings and act accordingly through trial and error in general with this form or presence – it’s kind of like getting feedback on what works for you. However, learning rules from scratch in contexts with complex exploration problems is a big challenge in RL. Because the agent does not receive any intermediate incentives, it cannot determine how close it is to complete the goal. As a result, exploring the space at random becomes necessary until the door opens. Given the length of the task and the level of precision required, this is highly unlikely.
 Exploring the state space randomly with preliminary information should be avoided while performing this activity. This prior knowledge aids the agent in determining which states of the environment are desirable and should be investigated further. Offline data collected by human demonstrations, programmed policies, or other RL agents could be used to train a policy and then initiate a new RL policy. This would include copying the pre-trained policy’s neural network to the new RL policy in the scenario where we utilize neural networks to describe the procedures. This process transforms the new RL policy into a pre-trained one. However, as seen below, naively initializing a new RL policy like this frequently fails, especially for value-based RL approaches.

 We have a model used in cardiac MRi imaging, it is used to select the best image in a series of images. It consists of images -> Resnet -> LSTM -> output.
 The heatmap we generate from the Resnet alone shows output like the image attached, instead of actual anatomy, there is only little squares. We think this is likely due to the residual in the Resnet because it is not present in a VGG, but does anyone else have a better explanation, and an idea of how to visualise a Resnet?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So, a bit of background, I am doing an RnD project in the area of improving the layout analysis of scientific documents. The proposed method is to use an active learning loop on standard object detection models and target those classes/layouts which are performing poorly and train the model based on them.
 Now, we have some selection strategies based on submodular selection functions to target the pages we want. I also have set up code to extract embeddings which will help me do the selection. But I don't have prior experience in active learning, especially setting it up with detectron2, because it seems to register a dataset to train, and it is really difficult to change dynamically in the middle of training, which is my use case.
 So I need some advice on the following:-
  
The document analysis datasets are huge, DocBank is 50GB of images alone. How can I effectively store the embeddings in memory when I will call my selection algorithms mentioned above?
 How to set up an active learning loop in detectron2 for object detection. Or are there any alternatives? Some resources/code would be better
 There is some literature evidence suggesting that simple CNN backbone embeddings represent an image better than FasterRCNN or MaskRCNN embeddings. Specifically, this paper seems to be working on spliced image retrieval and it claims the following. Any thoughts/prior experience on this?
 Finally, is there any evidence supporting improvement in accuracy/precision in object detection using active learning? Or are there some better training paradigms?
  
Thank you for your patience.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When deep networks or inputs involve extensive data sequences, learning in neural networks can be unstable. Recurrent states in vanilla recurrent neural networks (RNNs) are generated by repeatedly applying a linear transformation followed by a pointwise nonlinearity. This becomes unstable when the linear transformation’s eigenvalues are not of magnitude one. 
 Unitary matrices have been utilized to solve the problem of disappearing and exploding gradients because they have eigenvalues of size one, naturally, and have been. Unitary convolutional layers have recently been developed in a similar way to aid in the development of more stable deep networks with norm-preserving transformations.
 The loss function’s derivative with respect to the weights is called a gradient. During backpropagation in neural networks, it is utilized to update the weights to minimize the loss function. When traveled backward with each layer, the derivative or slope continuously grows lower, resulting in a vanishing gradient. When the weight update is exponentially small, the training time is excessively long. In the worst-case scenario, the neural network training may be stopped entirely. Exploding gradients, on the other hand, occur when the slope increases with each successive layer during backpropagation. The gradient will never converge due to the high weights, causing it to oscillate around the minima without ever reaching a global minima point.

 Q[s,a] = Q[s,a] + lr * (reward + gamma * max(Q[s,a]t+1) — Q[s,a]) 
 Where future state reward is considered since the best current reward doesn't grantee the optimal path. E.g.: 
  
Path A: Q[s,a]t = 1, Q[s,a]t+1 = 10 Total: 11
 Path B: Q[s,a]t = 5, Q[s,a]t+1 = 1 Total: 6
  
Not sure if this is a good analogy but here it gives the result that A is the optimal path even though its immediate reward at (t) is less than B.
 Further Question:
 Is there additional benefits to considering future rewards further than Q[s,a]t+1 ?
 Example: 
 Q[s,a] = Q[s,a] + lr * (reward + gamma* max(Q[s,a]t+2) - gamma * max(Q[s,a]t+1) — Q[s,a])

The input data is a 2D matrix, with the states/features being one dimension and time being the other dimension. But I want to use multiple trajectories of the same dynamical system for training, so the training data would be 3D (i.e., multiple 2D matrices). Are there examples where this has been done?
 Linear regression techniques (like pseudoinverse or LASSO) seem to be used to get the system matrix (in DMD) or the weights for the features (in SINDy). Can these methods be extended to 3D input data?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi guys. I am currently implementing REDQ by modifying a working implementation of SAC (basically adapted from Spinup) and so far my implementation doesn't work, I am trying to understand why. By looking at the authors' implementation I notice they use 1 pytorch optimizer per Q network, whereas I only use 1 for all parameters. So I wonder, is there any good reason for using several optimizers here?
 Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am fairly new to RL. I'm trying to train an agent (like in gym's Cartpole env) in an environment with noisy (Gaussian noise) observation. I have added Gaussian noise to angle only (not to cart position, cart velocity or ang_velocity). I was fooling around with PPO in stable_baselines but haven't had much luck. Any suggestions on what needs to be tweaked or any good algorithm for this task? 
 Also, I tried changing the default forcing magnitude of 10 to other values like 30 but it didn't help much.

From my understanding, it looks like ACER is an extension of A3C, and it seems like the difference between A2C and A3C is that in A2C parameters are updated synchronously and that helps with big batch sizes. 
 Is it still possible to implement some kind of replay buffer on A2C?
 Are there any papers that involve implementing a paper with A2C that you recommend I read?

 Happy to share our CVPR-2022 paper "Local Learning Matters: Rethinking Data Heterogeneity in Federated Learning"
 Paper: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2111.14213.pdf
 Code: https://github.com/mmendiet/FedAlign
 Federated learning (FL) is a promising strategy for performing privacy-preserving, distributed learning with a network of clients (i.e., edge devices). However, the data distribution among clients is often non-IID in nature, making efficient optimization difficult. To alleviate this issue, many FL algorithms focus on mitigating the effects of data heterogeneity across clients by introducing a variety of proximal terms, some incurring considerable compute and/or memory overheads, to restrain local updates with respect to the global model. Instead, we consider rethinking solutions to data heterogeneity in FL with a focus on local learning generality rather than proximal restriction. To this end, we first present a systematic study informed by second-order indicators to better understand algorithm effectiveness in FL. Interestingly, we find that standard regularization methods are surprisingly strong performers in mitigating data heterogeneity effects. Based on our findings, we further propose a simple and effective method, FedAlign, to overcome data heterogeneity and the pitfalls of previous methods. FedAlign achieves competitive accuracy with state-of-the-art FL methods across a variety of settings while minimizing computation and memory overhead.

 ​
 Extreme-scale language models have recently exhibited incredible performance on natural language processing challenges. This is due to their ever-increasing size, exceeding 500 billion parameters. However, while these models have grown in popularity in recent years, the amount of data utilized to train them has not increased. The current generation of huge language models is clearly undertrained. Three prediction approaches for optimally choosing both model size and training length have been proposed by a DeepMind research team.
 Three approaches have been mentioned to estimate the optimal parameter:
  
Change the size of the models and the number of training tokens.
 IsoFLOP profiles
 Using a parametric loss function to fit a model
  
The ultimate pretraining loss is calculated as the number of model parameters and training tokens. They minimize the loss function under the restriction of the FLOPs function, which is equal to the computational budget because the computational budget is a probabilistic function of the number of observed training tokens and model parameters.

Dear ICML Authors, 
 As we are seeing this happen, we just wanted to send you a brief explanation -- this only applies to some few papers. A few papers are losing reviews because of newly arising conflicts. If you did not enter your conflicts in CMT during the submission phase (as requested via CMT), then they could not be used in paper assignments. If you enter them now, any reviews by reviewers with conflicting domains will disappear, and you may see fewer reviews as a result. Unfortunately, we have no control over this, as the conflicts should have been entered when the paper was submitted. 
 Best, 
 Stefanie, Le and Csaba

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi everyone,
 I built a small library to help with hyperparameter search for deep learning models created with pytorch, because I got kinda tired of having to rewrite large pieces code over and over again.
 You can check it out here: https://github.com/michi-jeremias/tinydl or you can even install it with pip (pip install tinydl). I have included a readme and an example of how the library can be used.
 About the library, it's pretty flexible about reporting different metrics to the console and to tensorboard (add_scalar, add_hparam) at each stage of the process, like after a batch, epoch of after a whole run over multiple epochs. It can also be easily extended to include other metrics or new types of outputs.
 Since this is basically my first attempt at a software project that's not intended only to be used by myself I'd be happy about any feedback you have for me!
 If the project doesn't qualify to be posted here due to being too simple/too much on a beginner level, apologies for that.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am trying to implement stylegan2 and there are so many things here that are not explained either well, or at all in the paper.
 ​
  
How exactly is path length regularization implemented? In this PT code we can see that the $|J^T_w.y|$ is computed as follows:
  
​
 def g_path_regularize(fake_img, latents, mean_path_length, decay=0.01): noise = torch.randn_like(fake_img) / math.sqrt( fake_img.shape[2] * fake_img.shape[3] ) grad, = autograd.grad( outputs=(fake_img * noise).sum(), inputs=latents, create_graph=True ) path_lengths = torch.sqrt(grad.pow(2).sum(2).mean(1)) path_mean = mean_path_length + decay * (path_lengths.mean() - mean_path_length) path_penalty = (path_lengths - path_mean).pow(2).mean() return path_penalty, path_mean.detach(), path_lengths 
 This is based on this official TF implementation.
 The problem I have is that from what I understand, fake_img is 4D, and latents is 2D. The grad output in this case will be 2D and grad.pow(2).sum(2) cannot be computed because the third axis does not exist. Obviously people who are using these repos have not reported any issue regarding mismatch of shapes and axes, so I believe there is something else going on.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I spent some time reading about and playing around with speech denoising DNNs ~2019. At the time the popular architecture was U-Net (encoder -> bottleneck -> decoder with skip connections) operating on spectrograms. These U-Nets were trained directly on noisy/clean speech pairs and the loss was the difference between the predicted denoised images and actual denoised image. MSE between the predicted/actual images was a baseline loss but people alse added "feature loss" or sometimes a GAN-based loss function as well.
 Anyway a cursory reading of the DALL-E 2 paper has me thinking about that approach. I'm curious to know if a similar approach used for DALL-E has been tried for audio denoising:
  
pre-train an encoder/decoder in a self-supervised fashion on a large dataset of audio
 train a denoiser to operate only in the latent space (ie the most compressed representation that is passed from the encoder to the decoder)
  
step 1 - self-supervised training of encoder/decoder

 step 2 - train denoiser in latent space only

 step 3 - do inference by feeding denoised latent space vector into the decoder

 Is this a common approach already? It seems like once you have a good pretrained encoder/decoder pair then the denoiser training would be much more efficient than training an entire network that does everything at once from scratch (smaller search space, faster training loop)

have opened the door to multi-robot systems consisting of hundreds/thousands of
robots, with promising applications to automated manufacturing, disaster
relief, harvesting, last-mile delivery, port/airport operations, or search and
rescue. The community has leveraged model-free multi-agent reinforcement
learning (MARL) to devise efficient, scalable controllers for multi-robot
systems (MRS). This review aims to provide an analysis of the state-of-the-art
in distributed MARL for multi-robot cooperation.

Recent findings: Decentralized MRS face fundamental challenges, such as
non-stationarity and partial observability. Building upon the "centralized
training, decentralized execution" paradigm, recent MARL approaches include
independent learning, centralized critic, value decomposition, and
communication learning approaches. Cooperative behaviors are demonstrated
through AI benchmarks and fundamental real-world robotic capabilities such as
multi-robot motion/path planning.

Summary: This survey reports the challenges surrounding decentralized
model-free MARL for multi-robot cooperation and existing classes of approaches.
We present benchmarks and robotic applications along with a discussion on
current open avenues for research.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Streamlined qBOLD acquisitions enable experimentally straightforward
observations of brain oxygen metabolism. $R_2^\prime$ maps are easily inferred;
however, the Oxygen extraction fraction (OEF) and deoxygenated blood volume
(DBV) are more ambiguously determined from the data. As such, existing
inference methods tend to yield very noisy and underestimated OEF maps, while
overestimating DBV.

This work describes a novel probabilistic machine learning approach that can
infer plausible distributions of OEF and DBV. Initially, we create a model that
produces informative voxelwise prior distribution based on synthetic training
data. Contrary to prior work, we model the joint distribution of OEF and DBV
through a scaled multivariate logit-Normal distribution, which enables the
values to be constrained within a plausible range. The prior distribution model
is used to train an efficient amortized variational Bayesian inference model.
This model learns to infer OEF and DBV by predicting real image data, with few
training data required, using the signal equations as a forward model.

We demonstrate that our approach enables the inference of smooth OEF and DBV
maps, with a physiologically plausible distribution that can be adapted through
specification of an informative prior distribution. Other benefits include
model comparison (via the evidence lower bound) and uncertainty quantification
for identifying image artefacts. Results are demonstrated on a small study
comparing subjects undergoing hyperventilation and at rest. We illustrate that
the proposed approach allows measurement of gray matter differences in OEF and
DBV and enables voxelwise comparison between conditions, where we observe
significant increases in OEF and $R_2^\prime$ during hyperventilation.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Time series data occurs widely, and outlier detection is a fundamental
problem in data mining, which has numerous applications. Existing
autoencoder-based approaches deliver state-of-the-art performance on
challenging real-world data but are vulnerable to outliers and exhibit low
explainability. To address these two limitations, we propose robust and
explainable unsupervised autoencoder frameworks that decompose an input time
series into a clean time series and an outlier time series using autoencoders.
Improved explainability is achieved because clean time series are better
explained with easy-to-understand patterns such as trends and periodicities. We
provide insight into this by means of a post-hoc explainability analysis and
empirical studies. In addition, since outliers are separated from clean time
series iteratively, our approach offers improved robustness to outliers, which
in turn improves accuracy. We evaluate our approach on five real-world datasets
and report improvements over the state-of-the-art approaches in terms of
robustness and explainability.

While deep learning models achieve superior performance, often statistically
better than humans, their adoption into safety-critical settings, such as
healthcare or self-driving cars is hindered by their inability to provide
safety guarantees or to expose the inner workings of the model in a human
understandable form. We present Mo\"ET, a novel model based on Mixture of
Experts, consisting of decision tree experts and a generalized linear model
gating function. Thanks to such gating function the model is more expressive
than the standard decision tree. To support non-differentiable decision trees
as experts, we formulate a novel training procedure. In addition, we introduce
a hard thresholding version, Mo\"ETH, in which predictions are made solely by a
single expert chosen via the gating function. Thanks to that property, Mo\"ETH
allows each prediction to be easily decomposed into a set of logical rules in a
form which can be easily verified. While Mo\"ET is a general use model, we
illustrate its power in the reinforcement learning setting. By training Mo\"ET
models using an imitation learning procedure on deep RL agents we outperform
the previous state-of-the-art technique based on decision trees while
preserving the verifiability of the models. Moreover, we show that Mo\"ET can
also be used in real-world supervised problems on which it outperforms other
verifiable machine learning models.]]></summary>

unsupervised FL whose model is still a classifier for predicting class labels,

propose federation of unsupervised learning (FedUL), where the unlabeled data
are transformed into surrogate labeled data for each of the clients, a modified
model is trained by supervised FL, and the wanted model is recovered from the
modified model. FedUL is a very general solution to unsupervised FL: it is
compatible with many supervised FL methods, and the recovery of the wanted
model can be theoretically guaranteed as if the data have been labeled.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Despite the success of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) on various applications,
GNNs encounter significant performance degradation when the amount of
supervision signals, i.e., number of labeled nodes, is limited, which is
expected as GNNs are trained solely based on the supervision obtained from the
labeled nodes. On the other hand,recent self-supervised learning paradigm aims
to train GNNs by solving pretext tasks that do not require any labeled nodes,
and it has shown to even outperform GNNs trained with few labeled nodes.
However, a major drawback of self-supervised methods is that they fall short of
learning class discriminative node representations since no labeled information
is utilized during training. To this end, we propose a novel semi-supervised
method for graphs, GraFN, that leverages few labeled nodes to ensure nodes that
belong to the same class to be grouped together, thereby achieving the best of
both worlds of semi-supervised and self-supervised methods. Specifically, GraFN
randomly samples support nodes from labeled nodes and anchor nodes from the
entire graph. Then, it minimizes the difference between two predicted class
distributions that are non-parametrically assigned by anchor-supports
similarity from two differently augmented graphs. We experimentally show that
GraFN surpasses both the semi-supervised and self-supervised methods in terms
of node classification on real-world graphs. The source code for GraFN is

increasingly popular. Most RL methods use fixed action interval (denoted as
tduration) and actuate or maintain a phase every tduration, which makes the
phase duration less dynamic and flexible. In addition, the actuated phase can
be arbitrary, affecting the real-world deployment, which requires a fixed
cyclical phase structure. To address these challenges, we propose a multi-level
traffic signal control framework, DynLight, which uses an optimization method
Max-QueueLength (M-QL) to determine the phase and uses a deep Q-network to
determine the corresponding duration. Based on DynLight, we further propose
DynLight-C that adopts a well trained deep Q-network of DynLight and replace
M-QL by a fixed cyclical control policy that actuate a set of phases in fixed
order to realize cyclical phase structure. Comprehensive experiments on
multiple real-world datasets demonstrate that DynLight achives a new
state-of-the-art. Furthermore, the deep Q-network of DynLight can learn well on
determining the phase duration and DynLight-C demonstrates high performance for
deployment.]]></summary>

formulates a new game theoretic framework for this phenomenon, called

concepts, namely (i) performatively stable equilibria and (ii) Nash equilibria
of the game. The latter equilibria are arguably more informative, but can be
found efficiently only when the game is monotone. We show that under mild
assumptions, the performatively stable equilibria can be found efficiently by a
variety of algorithms, including repeated retraining and the repeated
(stochastic) gradient method. We then establish transparent sufficient
conditions for strong monotonicity of the game and use them to develop
algorithms for finding Nash equilibria. We investigate derivative free methods
and adaptive gradient algorithms wherein each player alternates between
learning a parametric description of their distribution and gradient steps on
the empirical risk. Synthetic and semi-synthetic numerical experiments

various applications, this is frequently infeasible because of intractable
multiple summations (or integrations). Spatial Monte Carlo integration (SMCI)
is a sampling-based approximation, and can provide high-accuracy estimations
for such intractable expectations. To evaluate the expectation of a function of
variables in a specific region (called target region), SMCI considers a larger
region containing the target region (called sum region). In SMCI, the multiple
summation for the variables in the sum region is precisely executed, and that
in the outer region is evaluated by the sampling approximation such as the
standard Monte Carlo integration. It is guaranteed that the accuracy of the
SMCI estimator is monotonically improved as the size of the sum region
increases. However, a haphazard expansion of the sum region could cause a
combinatorial explosion. Therefore, we hope to improve the accuracy without
such region expansion. In this study, based on the theory of generalized least
squares, a new effective method is proposed by combining multiple SMCI
estimators. The validity of the proposed method is demonstrated theoretically
and numerically. The results indicate that the proposed method can be effective
in the inverse Ising problem (or Boltzmann machine learning).]]></summary>

equations(SDE) is proposed in this paper. The central goal is to solve forward
and inverse stochastic problems more effectively using limited data. Deep
operator network(DeepONet) has been proposed recently for operator learning.
Compared to other neural networks to learn functions, it aims at the problem of
learning nonlinear operators. However, it can be challenging by using the
original model to learn nonlinear operators for high-dimensional stochastic
problems. We propose a new multi-resolution autoencoder DeepONet model referred
to as MultiAuto-DeepONet to deal with this difficulty with the aid of
convolutional autoencoder. The encoder part of the network is designed to
reduce the dimensionality as well as discover the hidden features of
high-dimensional stochastic inputs. The decoder is designed to have a special
structure, i.e. in the form of DeepONet. The first DeepONet in decoder is
designed to reconstruct the input function involving randomness while the
second one is used to approximate the solution of desired equations. Those two
DeepONets has a common branch net and two independent trunk nets. This
architecture enables us to deal with multi-resolution inputs naturally. By
adding $L_1$ regularization to our network, we found the outputs from the
branch net and two trunk nets all have sparse structures. This reduces the
number of trainable parameters in the neural network thus making the model more
efficient. Finally, we conduct several numerical experiments to illustrate the
effectiveness of our proposed MultiAuto-DeepONet model with uncertainty

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Principal component analysis (PCA) is a dimensionality reduction method in
data analysis that involves diagonalizing the covariance matrix of the dataset.
Recently, quantum algorithms have been formulated for PCA based on
diagonalizing a density matrix. These algorithms assume that the covariance
matrix can be encoded in a density matrix, but a concrete protocol for this
encoding has been lacking. Our work aims to address this gap. Assuming
amplitude encoding of the data, with the data given by the ensemble $\{p_i,|
\psi_i \rangle\}$, then one can easily prepare the ensemble average density
matrix $\overline{\rho} = \sum_i p_i |\psi_i\rangle \langle \psi_i |$. We first
show that $\overline{\rho}$ is precisely the covariance matrix whenever the
dataset is centered. For quantum datasets, we exploit global phase symmetry to
argue that there always exists a centered dataset consistent with
$\overline{\rho}$, and hence $\overline{\rho}$ can always be interpreted as a
covariance matrix. This provides a simple means for preparing the covariance
matrix for arbitrary quantum datasets or centered classical datasets. For
uncentered classical datasets, our method is so-called "PCA without centering",
which we interpret as PCA on a symmetrized dataset. We argue that this closely
corresponds to standard PCA, and we derive equations and inequalities that
bound the deviation of the spectrum obtained with our method from that of
standard PCA. We numerically illustrate our method for the MNIST handwritten
digit dataset. We also argue that PCA on quantum datasets is natural and
meaningful, and we numerically implement our method for molecular ground-state
datasets.]]></summary>

parsing Excel Files, reading and writing text files line by line, etc.
Developers can greatly benefit from automatic API usage sequence generation
based on natural language queries for building applications in a faster and
cleaner manner. Existing approaches utilize information retrieval models to
search for matching API sequences given a query or use RNN-based
encoder-decoder to generate API sequences. As it stands, the first approach
treats queries and API names as bags of words. It lacks deep comprehension of
the semantics of the queries. The latter approach adapts a neural language
model to encode a user query into a fixed-length context vector and generate
API sequences from the context vector.

We want to understand the effectiveness of recent Pre-trained Transformer
based Models (PTMs) for the API learning task. These PTMs are trained on large
natural language corpora in an unsupervised manner to retain contextual
knowledge about the language and have found success in solving similar Natural
Language Processing (NLP) problems. However, the applicability of PTMs has not
yet been explored for the API sequence generation task. We use a dataset that
contains 7 million annotations collected from GitHub to evaluate the PTMs
empirically. This dataset was also used to assess previous approaches. Based on
our results, PTMs generate more accurate API sequences and outperform other
related methods by around 11%. We have also identified two different
tokenization approaches that can contribute to a significant boost in PTMs'
performance for the API sequence generation task.]]></summary>

show via simulations that by using the past local updates, the FL algorithm can

machine learning models for human behavior include a dearth of labeled training
data and difficulty of acquiring high quality labels. Active learning is a
paradigm for using algorithms to computationally select a useful subset of data
points to label using metrics for model uncertainty and data similarity. We
explore active learning for naturalistic computer vision emotion data, a
particularly heterogeneous and complex data space due to inherently subjective
labels. Using frames collected from gameplay acquired from a therapeutic
smartphone game for children with autism, we run a simulation of active
learning using gameplay prompts as metadata to aid in the active learning
process. We find that active learning using information generated during
gameplay slightly outperforms random selection of the same number of labeled
frames. We next investigate a method to conduct active learning with subjective
data, such as in affective computing, and where multiple crowdsourced labels
can be acquired for each image. Using the Child Affective Facial Expression
(CAFE) dataset, we simulate an active learning process for crowdsourcing many
labels and find that prioritizing frames using the entropy of the crowdsourced
label distribution results in lower categorical cross-entropy loss compared to
random frame selection. Collectively, these results demonstrate pilot

the neural-based methods learn the semantic connection between code diffs and

behind a data generating mechanism (i.e., phenomenon) we happen to be
interested in. Uncovering such relationships allows us to identify the true
working of a phenomenon and, most importantly, articulate a model that may
enable us to further explore the phenomenon on hand and/or allow us to predict
it accurately. Fundamentally, such models are likely to be derived via a causal
approach (as opposed to an observational or empirical mean). In this approach,
causal discovery is required to create a causal model, which can then be
applied to infer the influence of interventions, and answer any hypothetical
questions (i.e., in the form of What ifs? Etc.) that we might have. This paper
builds a case for causal discovery and causal inference and contrasts that
against traditional machine learning approaches; all from a civil and
structural engineering perspective. More specifically, this paper outlines the
key principles of causality and the most commonly used algorithms and packages
for causal discovery and causal inference. Finally, this paper also presents a

appearance of highly motion-blurred objects from a video. To this end, we model
the blurred appearance of a fast moving object in a generative fashion by
parametrizing its 3D position, rotation, velocity, acceleration, bounces,
shape, and texture over the duration of a predefined time window spanning
multiple frames. Using differentiable rendering, we are able to estimate all
parameters by minimizing the pixel-wise reprojection error to the input video
via backpropagating through a rendering pipeline that accounts for motion blur
by averaging the graphics output over short time intervals. For that purpose,
we also estimate the camera exposure gap time within the same optimization. To
account for abrupt motion changes like bounces, we model the motion trajectory
as a piece-wise polynomial, and we are able to estimate the specific time of
the bounce at sub-frame accuracy. Experiments on established benchmark datasets
demonstrate that our method outperforms previous methods for fast moving object
deblurring and 3D reconstruction.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Multi-institutional efforts can facilitate training of deep MRI
reconstruction models, albeit privacy risks arise during cross-site sharing of
imaging data. Federated learning (FL) has recently been introduced to address
privacy concerns by enabling distributed training without transfer of imaging
data. Existing FL methods for MRI reconstruction employ conditional models to
map from undersampled to fully-sampled acquisitions via explicit knowledge of
the imaging operator. Since conditional models generalize poorly across
different acceleration rates or sampling densities, imaging operators must be
fixed between training and testing, and they are typically matched across
sites. To improve generalization and flexibility in multi-institutional
collaborations, here we introduce a novel method for MRI reconstruction based
on Federated learning of Generative IMage Priors (FedGIMP). FedGIMP leverages a
two-stage approach: cross-site learning of a generative MRI prior, and
subject-specific injection of the imaging operator. The global MRI prior is
learned via an unconditional adversarial model that synthesizes high-quality MR
images based on latent variables. Specificity in the prior is preserved via a
mapper subnetwork that produces site-specific latents. During inference, the
prior is combined with subject-specific imaging operators to enable
reconstruction, and further adapted to individual test samples by minimizing
data-consistency loss. Comprehensive experiments on multi-institutional
datasets clearly demonstrate enhanced generalization performance of FedGIMP
against site-specific and federated methods based on conditional models, as
well as traditional reconstruction methods.]]></summary>

Constrained Markov Decision Processes under probability one constraints. We
argue that stationary policies are not sufficient for solving this problem, and
that a rich class of policies can be found by endowing the controller with a
scalar quantity, so called budget, that tracks how close the agent is to
violating the constraint. We show that the minimal budget required to act
safely can be obtained as the smallest fixed point of a Bellman-like operator,
for which we analyze its convergence properties. We also show how to learn this
quantity when the true kernel of the Markov decision process is not known,
while providing sample-complexity bounds. The utility of knowing this minimal

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Federated learning is an emerging research paradigm for enabling
collaboratively training deep learning models without sharing patient data.
However, the data from different institutions are usually heterogeneous across
institutions, which may reduce the performance of models trained using
federated learning. In this study, we propose a novel heterogeneity-aware
federated learning method, SplitAVG, to overcome the performance drops from
data heterogeneity in federated learning. Unlike previous federated methods
that require complex heuristic training or hyper parameter tuning, our SplitAVG
leverages the simple network split and feature map concatenation strategies to
encourage the federated model training an unbiased estimator of the target data
distribution. We compare SplitAVG with seven state-of-the-art federated
learning methods, using centrally hosted training data as the baseline on a
suite of both synthetic and real-world federated datasets. We find that the
performance of models trained using all the comparison federated learning
methods degraded significantly with the increasing degrees of data
heterogeneity. In contrast, SplitAVG method achieves comparable results to the
baseline method under all heterogeneous settings, that it achieves 96.2% of the
accuracy and 110.4% of the mean absolute error obtained by the baseline in a
diabetic retinopathy binary classification dataset and a bone age prediction
dataset, respectively, on highly heterogeneous data partitions. We conclude
that SplitAVG method can effectively overcome the performance drops from
variability in data distributions across institutions. Experimental results
also show that SplitAVG can be adapted to different base networks and
generalized to various types of medical imaging tasks.]]></summary>

achieves better performance than its counterpart, i.e., uniform strategy, due
to its superior representational capacity. However, many nonuniform
quantization methods overlook the complicated projection process in
implementing the nonuniformly quantized weights/activations, which incurs
non-negligible time and space overhead in hardware deployment. In this study,
we propose Nonuniform-to-Uniform Quantization (N2UQ), a method that can
maintain the strong representation ability of nonuniform methods while being
hardware-friendly and efficient as the uniform quantization for model
inference. We achieve this through learning the flexible in-equidistant input
thresholds to better fit the underlying distribution while quantizing these
real-valued inputs into equidistant output levels. To train the quantized
network with learnable input thresholds, we introduce a generalized
straight-through estimator (G-STE) for intractable backward derivative
calculation w.r.t. threshold parameters. Additionally, we consider entropy
preserving regularization to further reduce information loss in weight
quantization. Even under this adverse constraint of imposing uniformly
quantized weights and activations, our N2UQ outperforms state-of-the-art
nonuniform quantization methods by 0.5~1.7 on ImageNet, demonstrating the
contribution of N2UQ design. Code and models are available at:

engineering, in this paper, we take a different perspective: the classification
margins. We study the relationship between the margins and logits

biased logits are positively correlated. We propose MARC, a simple yet
effective MARgin Calibration function to dynamically calibrate the biased
margins for unbiased logits. We validate MARC through extensive experiments on
common long-tailed benchmarks including CIFAR-LT, ImageNet-LT, Places-LT, and
iNaturalist-LT. Experimental results demonstrate that our MARC achieves
favorable results on these benchmarks. In addition, MARC is extremely easy to

challenge in surveillance applications. Such objects are represented by small
number of pixels in the image and lack sufficient details, making them
difficult to detect using conventional detectors. In this work, an open-source
framework called Slicing Aided Hyper Inference (SAHI) is proposed that provides
a generic slicing aided inference and fine-tuning pipeline for small object
detection. The proposed technique is generic in the sense that it can be
applied on top of any available object detector without any fine-tuning.
Experimental evaluations, using object detection baselines on the Visdrone and
xView aerial object detection datasets show that the proposed inference method
can increase object detection AP by 6.8%, 5.1% and 5.3% for FCOS, VFNet and
TOOD detectors, respectively. Moreover, the detection accuracy can be further
increased with a slicing aided fine-tuning, resulting in a cumulative increase
of 12.7%, 13.4% and 14.5% AP in the same order. Proposed technique has been

agent by manipulating the cost signals. We show that a small falsification of
the cost parameters will only lead to a bounded change in the optimal policy.
The bound is linear on the amount of falsification the attacker can apply to
the cost parameters. We propose an attack model where the attacker aims to
mislead the agent into learning a `nefarious' policy by intentionally
falsifying the cost parameters. We formulate the attack's problem as a convex
optimization problem and develop necessary and sufficient conditions to check
the achievability of the attacker's goal.

We showcase the adversarial manipulation on two types of LQG learners: the
batch RL learner and the other is the adaptive dynamic programming (ADP)
learner. Our results demonstrate that with only 2.296% of falsification on the
cost data, the attacker misleads the batch RL into learning the 'nefarious'
policy that leads the vehicle to a dangerous position. The attacker can also
gradually trick the ADP learner into learning the same `nefarious' policy by
consistently feeding the learner a falsified cost signal that stays close to
the actual cost signal. The paper aims to raise people's awareness of the
security threats faced by RL-enabled control systems.]]></summary>

materials design and automated chemistry, is increasing. A major challenge,
however, lies in fact that measuring the state of the system is often costly
and time consuming in scientific applications, whereas policy learning with RL
requires a measurement after each time step. In this work, we make the
measurement costs explicit in the form of a costed reward and propose a
framework that enables off-the-shelf deep RL algorithms to learn a policy for
both selecting actions and determining whether or not to measure the current
state of the system at each time step. In this way, the agents learn to balance
the need for information with the cost of information. Our results show that
when trained under this regime, the Dueling DQN and PPO agents can learn
optimal action policies whilst making up to 50\% fewer state measurements, and
recurrent neural networks can produce a greater than 50\% reduction in
measurements. We postulate the these reduction can help to lower the barrier to
applying RL to real-world scientific applications.]]></summary>

TD-learning is a linear stochastic iterative algorithm to estimate the value

most popular and fundamental reinforcement learning algorithms. While there has
been a series of successful works in theoretical analysis of TD-learning, it
was not until recently that researchers found some guarantees on its
statistical efficiency. In this paper, we propose a control theoretic
finite-time analysis TD-learning, which exploits standard notions in linear

demonstrations, without access to an explicit reward signal. A popular class of
approach infers the (unknown) reward function via inverse reinforcement
learning (IRL) followed by maximizing this reward function via reinforcement
learning (RL). The policies learned via these approaches are however very
brittle in practice and deteriorate quickly even with small test-time
perturbations due to compounding errors. We propose Imitation with Planning at
Test-time (IMPLANT), a new meta-algorithm for imitation learning that utilizes
decision-time planning to correct for compounding errors of any base imitation
policy. In contrast to existing approaches, we retain both the imitation policy
and the rewards model at decision-time, thereby benefiting from the learning
signal of the two components. Empirically, we demonstrate that IMPLANT
significantly outperforms benchmark imitation learning approaches on standard

intelligence. It is often inefficient to conduct reasoning and inference
directly in the space of raw sensory representations, such as pixel values of
images. Representation learning allows us to automatically discover suitable
representations from raw sensory data. For example, given raw sensory data, a
deep neural network learns nonlinear representations at its hidden layers,
which are subsequently used for classification at its output layer. This
happens implicitly during training through minimizing a supervised or
unsupervised loss. In this paper, we study the dynamics of such implicit
nonlinear representation learning. We identify a pair of a new assumption and a
novel condition, called the common model structure assumption and the
data-architecture alignment condition. Under the common model structure
assumption, the data-architecture alignment condition is shown to be sufficient
for the global convergence and necessary for the global optimality. Moreover,
our theory explains how and when increasing the network size does and does not
improve the training behaviors in the practical regime. Our results provide
practical guidance for designing a model structure: e.g., the common model
structure assumption can be used as a justification for using a particular
model structure instead of others. We also derive a new training framework,
which satisfies the data-architecture alignment condition by automatically
modifying any given training algorithm. Given a standard training algorithm,
the framework running its modified version is empirically shown to maintain
competitive test performances while providing global convergence guarantees for
deep residual neural networks with convolutions, skip connections, and batch
normalization with datasets, including MNIST, CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, Semeion,
KMNIST and SVHN.]]></summary>

represent the input data samples through a hierarchy of features, where the
size of the hierarchy is determined by the number of layers. In this paper, we
focus on enforcing the discriminative power of the high-level representations,
that are typically learned by the deeper layers (closer to the output). To this
end, we introduce a new loss term inspired by the Gini impurity, which is aimed
at minimizing the entropy (increasing the discriminative power) of individual
high-level features with respect to the class labels. Although our Gini loss
induces highly-discriminative features, it does not ensure that the
distribution of the high-level features matches the distribution of the
classes. As such, we introduce another loss term to minimize the
Kullback-Leibler divergence between the two distributions. We conduct
experiments on two image classification data sets (CIFAR-100 and Caltech 101),
considering multiple neural architectures ranging from convolutional networks
(ResNet-17, ResNet-18, ResNet-50) to transformers (CvT). Our empirical results

tool in solving tasks across various fields of application. The success of DNNs
is strongly connected to their high complexity in terms of the number of
network layers or of neurons in each layer, which severely complicates to
understand how DNNs solve their learned task. To improve the explainability of
DNNs, we adapt methods from neuroscience because this field has a rich
experience in analyzing complex and opaque systems. In this work, we draw
inspiration from how neuroscience uses topographic maps to visualize the
activity of the brain when it performs certain tasks. Transferring this
approach to DNNs can help to visualize and understand their internal processes
more intuitively, too. However, the inner structures of brains and DNNs differ
substantially. Therefore, to be able to visualize activations of neurons in
DNNs as topographic maps, we research techniques to layout the neurons in a
two-dimensional space in which neurons of similar activity are in the vicinity
of each other. In this work, we introduce and compare different methods to
obtain a topographic layout of the neurons in a network layer. Moreover, we
demonstrate how to use the resulting topographic activation maps to identify
errors or encoded biases in DNNs or data sets. Our novel visualization
technique improves the transparency of DNN-based algorithmic decision-making
systems and is accessible to a broad audience because topographic maps are
intuitive to interpret without expert-knowledge in Machine Learning.]]></summary>

prior biases about the environment it is exploring. Thus the robot assigns
equal importance to the goals which leads to insufficient exploration

are, measured by the state value function, to provide a hint for the robot to
make exploration decisions. We propose to learn state value functions from
previous offline collected datasets and then transfer and improve the value
function during testing in a new environment. Moreover, the environments
usually have very few and even no extrinsic reward or feedback for the robot.
Therefore in this work, we also tackle the problem of sparse extrinsic rewards
from the environments. We design several intrinsic rewards to encourage the
robot to obtain more information during exploration. These reward functions
then become the building blocks of the state value functions. We test our
method on challenging subterranean and urban environments. To the best of our

devices form a CTR tensor that has about 96% missing entries and has many zeros
on non-missing entries, which makes the standalone tensor completion method
unsatisfactory. Beside the CTR tensor, additional ad features or user
characteristics are often available. In this paper, we propose
Covariate-assisted Sparse Tensor Completion (COSTCO) to incorporate covariate
information for the recovery of the sparse tensor. The key idea is to jointly
extract latent components from both the tensor and the covariate matrix to
learn a synthetic representation. Theoretically, we derive the error bound for
the recovered tensor components and explicitly quantify the improvements on
both the reveal probability condition and the tensor recovery accuracy due to
covariates. Finally, we apply COSTCO to an advertisement dataset consisting of
a CTR tensor and ad covariate matrix, leading to 23% accuracy improvement over
the baseline. An important by-product is that ad latent components from COSTCO
reveal interesting ad clusters, which are useful for better ad targeting.]]></summary>

machine learning models, hyperparameter tuning is becoming increasingly
expensive. However, after assessing 40 tuning methods systematically, we find
that each faces certain limitations. In particular, methods that speed up
tuning via knowledge transfer typically require the final performance of
hyperparameters and do not focus on low-fidelity information. As we demonstrate
empirically, this common practice is suboptimal and can incur an unnecessary
use of resources. It is more cost-efficient to instead leverage low-fidelity
tuning observations to measure inter-task similarity and transfer knowledge
from existing to new tasks accordingly. However, performing multi-fidelity
tuning comes with its own challenges in the transfer setting: the noise in
additional observations and the need for performance forecasting. Therefore, we
propose and conduct a thorough analysis of a multi-task multi-fidelity Bayesian
optimization framework, which leads to the best instantiation--amortized
auto-tuning (AT2). We further present an offline-computed 27-task
hyperparameter recommendation (HyperRec) database to serve the community.
Extensive experiments on HyperRec and other real-world databases illustrate the

computer vision tasks despite large computation overhead against efficient
deployment. Structured (channel) pruning is usually applied to reduce the model
redundancy while preserving the network structure, such that the pruned network
can be easily deployed in practice. However, existing structured pruning
methods require hand-crafted rules which may lead to tremendous pruning space.
In this paper, we introduce Differentiable Annealing Indicator Search (DAIS)
that leverages the strength of neural architecture search in the channel
pruning and automatically searches for the effective pruned model with given
constraints on computation overhead. Specifically, DAIS relaxes the binarized
channel indicators to be continuous and then jointly learns both indicators and
model parameters via bi-level optimization. To bridge the non-negligible
discrepancy between the continuous model and the target binarized model, DAIS
proposes an annealing-based procedure to steer the indicator convergence
towards binarized states. Moreover, DAIS designs various regularizations based
on a priori structural knowledge to control the pruning sparsity and to improve
model performance. Experimental results show that DAIS outperforms
state-of-the-art pruning methods on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A two-stage online dereverberation algorithm for hearing devices is presented
in this paper. The approach combines a multi-channel multi-frame linear
filtering approach with a single-channel single-frame post-filter. Both
components rely on power spectral density (PSD) estimates provided by deep
neural networks (DNNs). This contribution extends our prior work, which shows
that directly optimizing for a criterion at the output of the multi-channel
linear filtering stage results in a more efficient dereverberation, as compared
to placing the criterion at the output of the DNN to optimize the PSD
estimation. In the present work, we show that the dereverberation performance
of the proposed first stage particularly improves the early-to-mid
reverberation ratio if trained end-to-end. We thus argue that it can be
combined with a post-filtering stage which benefits from the early-to-mid ratio
improvement and is consequently able to efficiently suppress the residual late
reverberation. This proposed two stage procedure is shown to be both very
effective in terms of dereverberation performance and computational demands.
Furthermore, the proposed system can be adapted to the needs of different types
of hearing-device users by controlling the amount of reduction of early
reflections. The proposed system outperforms the previously proposed end-to-end
DNN-supported linear filtering algorithm, as well as other traditional
approaches, based on an evaluation using the noise-free version of the WHAMR!

the variables are both discrete and continuous. In engineering applications,
the objective function is typically calculated with a numerically costly

therefore of a great practical interest, yet their resolution remains in a
large part an open scientific question. In this article, costly mixed problems
are approached through Gaussian processes where the discrete variables are
relaxed into continuous latent variables. The continuous space is more easily
harvested by classical Bayesian optimization techniques than a mixed space
would. Discrete variables are recovered either subsequently to the continuous
optimization, or simultaneously with an additional continuous-discrete
compatibility constraint that is handled with augmented Lagrangians. Several
possible implementations of such Bayesian mixed optimizers are compared. In
particular, the reformulation of the problem with continuous latent variables
is put in competition with searches working directly in the mixed space. Among
the algorithms involving latent variables and an augmented Lagrangian, a
particular attention is devoted to the Lagrange multipliers for which a local

the repeated optimization of three analytical functions and a beam design

concentrate on a subset of these concerning issues by prioritizing them
according to their contributions to motivational indices, e.g., the probability
of winning a game. This idea of concentration offers insights into
reinforcement learning of sophisticated Large-scale Multi-Agent Systems (LMAS)
participated by hundreds of agents. In such an LMAS, each agent receives a long
series of entity observations at each step, which can overwhelm existing
aggregation networks such as graph attention networks and cause inefficiency.
In this paper, we propose a concentration network called ConcNet. First,
ConcNet scores the observed entities considering several motivational indices,
e.g., expected survival time and state value of the agents, and then ranks,
prunes, and aggregates the encodings of observed entities to extract features.
Second, distinct from the well-known attention mechanism, ConcNet has a unique
motivational subnetwork to explicitly consider the motivational indices when
scoring the observed entities. Furthermore, we present a concentration policy
gradient architecture that can learn effective policies in LMAS from scratch.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that the presented architecture has excellent
scalability and flexibility, and significantly outperforms existing methods on
LMAS benchmarks.]]></summary>

weak supervision, they exhibit a gap in generative quality compared to unimodal

uncover a fundamental limitation that applies to a large family of
mixture-based multimodal VAEs. We prove that the sub-sampling of modalities
enforces an undesirable upper bound on the multimodal ELBO and thereby limits
the generative quality of the respective models. Empirically, we showcase the
generative quality gap on both synthetic and real data and present the
tradeoffs between different variants of multimodal VAEs. We find that none of
the existing approaches fulfills all desired criteria of an effective
multimodal generative model when applied on more complex datasets than those
used in previous benchmarks. In summary, we identify, formalize, and validate
fundamental limitations of VAE-based approaches for modeling weakly-supervised

can produce undesirable synthetic samples, where the data is sampled off the

generalization of mixup with provably and demonstrably desirable properties
that allows convex combinations of $N \geq 2$ samples, leading to more
realistic and diverse outputs that incorporate information from $N$ original
samples by using a $p$-series interpolant. We show that, compared to mixup,
$\zeta$-mixup better preserves the intrinsic dimensionality of the original
datasets, which is a desirable property for training generalizable models.
Furthermore, we show that our implementation of $\zeta$-mixup is faster than

the past decade in Anglo-European research institutions as an attempt to bring
together a critique of the power dynamics that underlie accelerating trends of
datafication with a normative commitment to the principles of social justice-a
commitment to the achievement of a society that is equitable, fair, and capable
of confronting the root causes of injustice.However, despite the seeming
novelty of such a data justice pedigree, this joining up of the critique of the
power imbalances that have shaped the digital and "big data" revolutions with a
commitment to social equity and constructive societal transformation has a
deeper historical, and more geographically diverse, provenance. As the stories
of the data justice initiatives, activism, and advocacy contained in this
volume well evidence, practices of data justice across the globe have, in fact,
largely preceded the elaboration and crystallisation of the idea of data
justice in contemporary academic discourse. In telling these data justice
stories, we hope to provide the reader with two interdependent tools of data
justice thinking: First, we aim to provide the reader with the critical
leverage needed to discern those distortions and malformations of data justice
that manifest in subtle and explicit forms of power, domination, and coercion.
Second, we aim to provide the reader with access to the historically effective

reference productions from the environment. Early in speech acquisition,
children make articulatory adjustments to match their caregivers' speech.
Grownup learners of a language tweak their speech to match the tutor reference.
This paper proposes a method to synthetically generate correct pronunciation
feedback given incorrect production. Furthermore, our aim is to generate the
corrected production while maintaining the speaker's original voice.

The system prompts the user to pronounce a phrase. The speech is recorded,
and the samples associated with the inaccurate phoneme are masked with zeros.
This waveform serves as an input to a speech generator, implemented as a deep
learning inpainting system with a U-net architecture, and trained to output a
reconstructed speech. The training set is composed of unimpaired proper speech
examples, and the generator is trained to reconstruct the original proper
speech. We evaluated the performance of our system on phoneme replacement of
minimal pair words of English as well as on children with pronunciation
disorders. Results suggest that human listeners slightly prefer our generated
speech over a smoothed replacement of the inaccurate phoneme with a production
of a different speaker.]]></summary>

transformer-based Natural Language Processing models. This attention mechanism
calculates a correlation score for each word with respect to the other words in
a sentence. Commonly, only a small subset of words highly correlates with the
word under attention, which is only determined at runtime. As such, a
significant amount of computation is inconsequential due to low attention
scores and can potentially be pruned. The main challenge is finding the
threshold for the scores below which subsequent computation will be
inconsequential. Although such a threshold is discrete, this paper formulates
its search through a soft differentiable regularizer integrated into the loss
function of the training. This formulation piggy backs on the back-propagation
training to analytically co-optimize the threshold and the weights
simultaneously, striking a formally optimal balance between accuracy and
computation pruning. To best utilize this mathematical innovation, we devise a
bit-serial architecture, dubbed LeOPArd, for transformer language models with
bit-level early termination microarchitectural mechanism. We evaluate our
design across 43 back-end tasks for MemN2N, BERT, ALBERT, GPT-2, and Vision
transformer models. Post-layout results show that, on average, LeOPArd yields
1.9x and 3.9x speedup and energy reduction, respectively, while keeping the

novel memory-guided domain generalization method for semantic segmentation

constant beyond the domains. Upon the meta-learning concept, we repeatedly
train memory-guided networks and simulate virtual test to 1) learn how to
memorize a domain-agnostic and distinct information of classes and 2) offer an
externally settled memory as a class-guidance to reduce the ambiguity of
representation in the test data of arbitrary unseen domain. To this end, we
also propose memory divergence and feature cohesion losses, which encourage to
learn memory reading and update processes for category-aware domain
generalization. Extensive experiments for semantic segmentation demonstrate the

data and have achieved significant progress in graph analysis tasks (e.g., node
classification) in recent years. However, similar to other deep neural networks
like Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs),
GNNs behave like a black box with their details hidden from model developers
and users. It is therefore difficult to diagnose possible errors of GNNs.
Despite many visual analytics studies being done on CNNs and RNNs, little
research has addressed the challenges for GNNs. This paper fills the research
gap with an interactive visual analysis tool, GNNLens, to assist model
developers and users in understanding and analyzing GNNs. Specifically,
Parallel Sets View and Projection View enable users to quickly identify and
validate error patterns in the set of wrong predictions; Graph View and Feature
Matrix View offer a detailed analysis of individual nodes to assist users in
forming hypotheses about the error patterns. Since GNNs jointly model the graph
structure and the node features, we reveal the relative influences of the two
types of information by comparing the predictions of three models: GNN,
Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), and GNN Without Using Features (GNNWUF). Two case
studies and interviews with domain experts demonstrate the effectiveness of
GNNLens in facilitating the understanding of GNN models and their errors.]]></summary>

machine learning which can be used to reduce the feature dimension without
deteriorating model's performance. Since obtaining annotated data is laborious
or even infeasible in many cases, unsupervised feature selection is more
practical in reality. Though lots of methods for unsupervised feature selection
have been proposed, these methods select features independently, thus it is no
guarantee that the group of selected features is optimal. What's more, the
number of selected features must be tuned carefully to obtain a satisfactory
result. To tackle these problems, we propose a joint adaptive graph and
structured sparsity regularization unsupervised feature selection (JASFS)
method in this paper, in which a $l_{2,0}$-norm regularization term with
respect to transformation matrix is imposed in the manifold learning for
feature selection, and a graph regularization term is incorporated into the
learning model to learn the local geometric structure of data adaptively. An
efficient and simple iterative algorithm is designed to solve the proposed
optimization problem with the analysis of computational complexity. After
optimized, a subset of optimal features will be selected in group, and the
number of selected features will be determined automatically. Experimental
results on eight benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the
proposed method compared with several state-of-the-art approaches.]]></summary>

a given design as input they compute an output representing system behavior.
Blackboxes are intended to be run in the forward direction. This paper presents
a new method of solving the inverse design problem namely, given requirements
or constraints on output, find an input that also optimizes an objective
function. This problem is challenging for several reasons. First, blackboxes
are not designed to be run in reverse. Second, inputs and outputs can be
discrete and continuous. Third, finding designs concurrently satisfying a set
of requirements is hard because designs satisfying individual requirements may
conflict with each other. Fourth, blackbox evaluations can be expensive.
Finally, blackboxes can sometimes fail to produce an output. This paper
presents CNMA, a new method of solving the inverse problem that overcomes these
challenges. CNMA tries to sample only the part of the design space relevant to
solving the problem, leveraging the power of neural networks, Mixed Integer
Linear Programs, and a new learning-from-failure feedback loop. The paper also
presents a parallel version of CNMA that improves the efficiency and quality of
solutions over the sequential version, and tries to steer it away from local
optima. CNMA's performance is evaluated against conventional optimization
methods for seven nonlinear design problems of 8 (two problems), 10, 15, 36 and
60 real-valued dimensions and one with 186 binary dimensions. Conventional
methods evaluated are off-the-shelf implementations of Bayesian Optimization
with Gaussian Processes, Nelder Mead and Random Search. The first two do not
solve problems that are high-dimensional, have discrete and continuous
variables or whose blackboxes can fail to return values. CNMA solves all

decomposition of matrices and tensors using deep generative networks. We
decompose a tensor as the product of low-rank tensor factors (e.g., a matrix as
the outer product of two vectors), where each low-rank tensor is generated by a
deep network (DN) that is trained in a self-supervised manner to minimize the
mean-squared approximation error. Our key observation is that the implicit
regularization inherent in DNs enables them to capture nonlinear signal
structures (e.g., manifolds) that are out of the reach of classical linear
methods like the singular value decomposition (SVD) and principal component
analysis (PCA). Furthermore, in contrast to the SVD and PCA, whose performance
deteriorates when the tensor's entries deviate from additive white Gaussian
noise, we demonstrate that the performance of DeepTensor is robust to a wide
range of distributions. We validate that DeepTensor is a robust and
computationally efficient drop-in replacement for the SVD, PCA, nonnegative
matrix factorization (NMF), and similar decompositions by exploring a range of
real-world applications, including hyperspectral image denoising, 3D MRI
tomography, and image classification. In particular, DeepTensor offers a 6dB

environments is critical to the development of hearing aid (HA) devices. For
this, it is important to derive a metric that can fairly predict speech
intelligibility for HA users. A straightforward approach is to conduct a
subjective listening test and use the test results as an evaluation metric.
However, conducting large-scale listening tests is time-consuming and
expensive. Therefore, several evaluation metrics were derived as surrogates for
subjective listening test results. In this study, we propose a multi-branched
speech intelligibility prediction model (MBI-Net), for predicting the
subjective intelligibility scores of HA users. MBI-Net consists of two branches
of models, with each branch consisting of a hearing loss model, a cross-domain
feature extraction module, and a speech intelligibility prediction model, to
process speech signals from one channel. The outputs of the two branches are
fused through a linear layer to obtain predicted speech intelligibility scores.
Experimental results confirm the effectiveness of MBI-Net, which produces
higher prediction scores than the baseline system in Track 1 and Track 2 on the

to be useful for many areas of software engineering (e.g., requirement

extensive efforts to manually curate a labeled dataset. When the classification
purpose changes (e.g. identifying bugs versus usability issues or sentiment),
new datasets should be labeled, which prevents the extensibility of the
developed models for new desired classes/tasks in practice. Recent pre-trained

manner and have found success in solving similar Natural Language Processing

classification compared to the existing models, as well as the transferability
of PTMs in multiple settings. Method: We empirically study the accuracy and
time efficiency of PTMs compared to prior approaches using six datasets from
literature. In addition, we investigate the performance of the PTMs trained on
app reviews (i.e. domain-specific PTMs) . We set up different studies to
evaluate PTMs in multiple settings: binary vs. multi-class classification,
zero-shot classification (when new labels are introduced to the model),
multi-task setting, and classification of reviews from different resources. The
datasets are manually labeled app review datasets from Google Play Store, Apple
App Store, and Twitter data. In all cases, Micro and Macro Precision, Recall,
and F1-scores will be used and we will report the time required for training
and prediction with the models.]]></summary>

control in a discounted infinite horizon MDP optimizing the variance of a

policy evaluation method and risk-neutral control method can be dropped in for
risk-averse control off the shelf, in both on- and off-policy settings. This
flexibility reduces the gap between risk-neutral control and risk-averse
control and is achieved by working on a novel augmented MDP directly. We
propose risk-averse TD3 as an example instantiating MVPI, which outperforms
vanilla TD3 and many previous risk-averse control methods in challenging Mujoco
robot simulation tasks under a risk-aware performance metric. This risk-averse
TD3 is the first to introduce deterministic policies and off-policy learning

privacy. In this problem, we are given a universe $U$ of items, possibly of
infinite size, and a database $D$ of users. Each user $i$ contributes a subset
$W_i \subseteq U$ of items. We want an ($\epsilon$,$\delta$)-differentially
private algorithm which outputs a subset $S \subset \cup_i W_i$ such that the
size of $S$ is as large as possible. The problem arises in countless real world
applications; it is particularly ubiquitous in natural language processing
(NLP) applications as vocabulary extraction. For example, discovering words,
sentences, $n$-grams etc., from private text data belonging to users is an
instance of the set union problem.

Known algorithms for this problem proceed by collecting a subset of items
from each user, taking the union of such subsets, and disclosing the items
whose noisy counts fall above a certain threshold. Crucially, in the above
process, the contribution of each individual user is always independent of the
items held by other users, resulting in a wasteful aggregation process, where
some item counts happen to be way above the threshold. We deviate from the
above paradigm by allowing users to contribute their items in a
$\textit{dependent fashion}$, guided by a $\textit{policy}$. In this new
setting ensuring privacy is significantly delicate. We prove that any policy
which has certain $\textit{contractive}$ properties would result in a
differentially private algorithm. We design two new algorithms, one using
Laplace noise and other Gaussian noise, as specific instances of policies
satisfying the contractive properties. Our experiments show that the new
algorithms significantly outperform previously known mechanisms for the
problem.]]></summary>

their quadratically growing complexity with respect to the input sequence

address this challenge by proposing a dynamic pruning method, which exploits
the temporal stability of data across tokens to reduce inference cost. The
threshold-based method only retains significant differences between the
subsequent tokens, effectively reducing the number of multiply-accumulates, as
well as the internal tensor data sizes. The approach is evaluated on the Google
Speech Commands Dataset for keyword spotting, and the performance is compared
against the baseline Keyword Transformer. Our experiments show that we can
reduce ~80% of operations while maintaining the original 98.4% accuracy.
Moreover, a reduction of ~87-94% operations can be achieved when only degrading
the accuracy by 1-4%, speeding up the multi-head self-attention inference by a

strongly (resp., general) convex regularizers using different sampling schemes,
where $\epsilon$ denote the target accuracy. We further show that the
complexity for computing the gradients of these regularizers, if necessary, can
be bounded by ${\cal O}\{(\log_\gamma \epsilon) [(1-\gamma)L/\mu]^{1/2}\log

adolescence or early adulthood. It reduces the life expectancy of patients by
15 years. Abnormal behavior, perception of emotions, social relationships, and
reality perception are among its most significant symptoms. Past studies have
revealed the temporal and anterior lobes of hippocampus regions of brain get
affected by SZ. Also, increased volume of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and
decreased volume of white and gray matter can be observed due to this disease.
The magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the popular neuroimaging technique used
to explore structural/functional brain abnormalities in SZ disorder owing to
its high spatial resolution. Various artificial intelligence (AI) techniques
have been employed with advanced image/signal processing methods to obtain
accurate diagnosis of SZ. This paper presents a comprehensive overview of
studies conducted on automated diagnosis of SZ using MRI modalities. Main
findings, various challenges, and future works in developing the automated SZ

human-annotated image-label data or language-image contrastive learning with
webly-crawled image-text pairs. While supervised learning may result in a more
discriminative representation, language-image pretraining shows unprecedented
zero-shot recognition capability, largely due to the different properties of
data sources and learning objectives. In this work, we introduce a new
formulation by combining the two data sources into a common image-text-label
space. In this space, we propose a new learning paradigm, called Unified
Contrastive Learning (UniCL) with a single learning objective to seamlessly
prompt the synergy of two data types. Extensive experiments show that our UniCL
is an effective way of learning semantically rich yet discriminative
representations, universally for image recognition in zero-shot, linear-probe,
fully finetuning and transfer learning scenarios. Particularly, it attains
gains up to 9.2% and 14.5% in average on zero-shot recognition benchmarks over
the language-image contrastive learning and supervised learning methods,
respectively. In linear probe setting, it also boosts the performance over the
two methods by 7.3% and 3.4%, respectively. Our study also indicates that UniCL
stand-alone is a good learner on pure image-label data, rivaling the supervised
learning methods across three image classification datasets and two types of

address this, we study how to discover interpretable equivariances from data.
Specifically, we formulate this discovery process as an optimization problem
over a model's parameter-sharing schemes. We propose to use the partition
distance to empirically quantify the accuracy of the recovered equivariance.
Also, we theoretically analyze the method for Gaussian data and provide a bound

matrices that have shared rows and/or columns. For example, cancer studies that
integrate multiple omics platforms across multiple types of cancer, pan-omics
pan-cancer analysis, have extended our knowledge of molecular heterogenity
beyond what was observed in single tumor and single platform studies. However,
these studies have been limited by available statistical methodology. We
propose a flexible approach to the simultaneous factorization and decomposition
of variation across such bidimensionally linked matrices, BIDIFAC+. This
decomposes variation into a series of low-rank components that may be shared
across any number of row sets (e.g., omics platforms) or column sets (e.g.,

decomposition of linked matrices, which has primarily focused on multiple
matrices that are linked in one dimension (rows or columns) only. Our objective
function extends nuclear norm penalization, is motivated by random matrix
theory, gives an identifiable decomposition under relatively mild conditions,

diverse set of tasks, from a given task distribution, to generalize to unseen
tasks, from the same distribution, with a limited amount of labeled data. The
underlying requirement for effective few-shot generalization is to learn a good
representation of the task manifold. One way to encourage this is to preserve
local neighborhoods in the feature space learned by the few-shot learner. To
this end, we introduce the notion of interval bounds from the provably robust
training literature to few-shot learning. The interval bounds are used to
characterize neighborhoods around the training tasks. These neighborhoods can
then be preserved by minimizing the distance between a task and its respective
bounds. We further introduce a novel strategy to artificially form new tasks
for training by interpolating between the available tasks and their respective
interval bounds, to aid in cases with a scarcity of tasks. We apply our
framework to both model-agnostic meta-learning as well as prototype-based
metric-learning paradigms. The efficacy of our proposed approach is evident
from the improved performance on several datasets from diverse domains in
comparison to a sizable number of recent competitors.]]></summary>

life. Previously, stress levels were determined by speaking with people and
gaining insight into what they had experienced recently or in the past.
Typically, stress is caused by an incidence that occurred a long time ago, but
sometimes it is triggered by unknown factors. This is a challenging and complex
task, but recent research advances have provided numerous opportunities to
automate it. The fundamental features of most of these techniques are electro
dermal activity (EDA) and heart rate values (HRV). We utilized an accelerometer
to measure body motions to solve this challenge. The proposed novel method
employs a test that measures a subject's electrocardiogram (ECG), galvanic skin
values (GSV), HRV values, and body movements in order to provide a low-cost and
time-saving solution for detecting stress lifestyle disease in modern times
using cyber physical systems. This study provides a new hybrid model for
lifestyle disease classification that decreases execution time while picking
the best collection of characteristics and increases classification accuracy.
The developed approach is capable of dealing with the class imbalance problem
by using WESAD (wearable stress and affect dataset) dataset. The new model uses
the Grid search (GS) method to select an optimized set of hyper parameters, and
it uses a combination of the Correlation coefficient based Recursive feature
elimination (CoC-RFE) method for optimal feature selection and gradient
boosting as an estimator to classify the dataset, which achieves high accuracy
and helps to provide smart, accurate, and high-quality healthcare systems. To
demonstrate the validity and utility of the proposed methodology, its
performance is compared to those of other well-established machine learning
models.]]></summary>

increasingly complex and hence the underlying system dynamics are often unknown
or difficult to characterize. Finding a good network control policy is of
significant importance to achieve desirable network performance (e.g., high
throughput or low delay). In this work, we consider using model-based
reinforcement learning (RL) to learn the optimal control policy for queueing
networks so that the average job delay (or equivalently the average queue
backlog) is minimized. Traditional approaches in RL, however, cannot handle the
unbounded state spaces of the network control problem. To overcome this
difficulty, we propose a new algorithm, called Reinforcement Learning for
Queueing Networks (RL-QN), which applies model-based RL methods over a finite
subset of the state space, while applying a known stabilizing policy for the
rest of the states. We establish that the average queue backlog under RL-QN
with an appropriately constructed subset can be arbitrarily close to the
optimal result. We evaluate RL-QN in dynamic server allocation, routing and
switching problems. Simulation results show that RL-QN minimizes the average
queue backlog effectively.]]></summary>

implied that language models (LMs) can be treated as knowledge bases. To this
end, this phenomena has been effective especially when these LMs are fine-tuned
towards not just data of a specific domain, but also to the style or linguistic
pattern of the prompts themselves. We observe that, satisfying a particular
linguistic pattern in prompts is an unsustainable constraint that unnecessarily
lengthens the probing task, especially because, they are often manually
designed and the range of possible prompt template patterns can vary depending
on the prompting objective and domain. We therefore explore an idea of using a
position-attention mechanism to capture positional information of each word in
a prompt relative to the mask to be filled, hence avoiding the need to
re-construct prompts when the prompts linguistic pattern changes. Using our
approach, we demonstrate the ability of eliciting answers to rare prompt
templates (in a case study on health outcome generation) such as Postfix and
Mixed patterns whose missing information is respectively at the start and in
multiple random places of the prompt. More so, using various biomedical PLMs,
our approach consistently outperforms a baseline in which the default mask

learning models over distributed edge devices, which attracts sustained
attention and has been extensively studied. However, the heterogeneity of
client data severely degrades the performance of FL compared with that in
centralized training. It causes the locally trained models of clients to move
in different directions. On the one hand, it slows down or even stalls the
global updates, leading to inefficient communication. On the other hand, it
enlarges the distances between local models, resulting in an aggregated global
model with poor performance. Fortunately, these shortcomings can be mitigated
by reducing the angle between the directions that local models move in. Based
on this fact, we propose FedCos, which reduces the directional inconsistency of
local models by introducing a cosine-similarity penalty. It promotes the local
model iterations towards an auxiliary global direction. Moreover, our approach
is auto-adapt to various non-IID settings without an elaborate selection of
hyperparameters. The experimental results show that FedCos outperforms the
well-known baselines and can enhance them under a variety of FL scenes,
including varying degrees of data heterogeneity, different number of
participants, and cross-silo and cross-device settings. Besides, FedCos
improves communication efficiency by 2 to 5 times. With the help of FedCos,
multiple FL methods require significantly fewer communication rounds than
before to obtain a model with comparable performance.]]></summary>

Bayesian data analysis, whereby a statistical model is evaluated in terms of
its ability to reproduce statistics of an unknown data generating process from

over a shared sample space, each exploiting a choice of factorisation that
makes sampling tractable in one of two directions (latent-to-data,
data-to-latent). We evaluate samples from these distributions, assessing their
(marginal) fit to the observed data and our choice of prior, and we also
evaluate samples through a pipeline that connects the two distributions
starting from a data sample, assessing whether together they exploit and reveal
latent factors of variation that are useful to a practitioner. We show that
this methodology offers possibilities for model selection qualitatively beyond

low-dimensional subspace. Engineering applications for modeling,
characterization, design, and control of such large-scale systems often rely on
dimensionality reduction to make solutions computationally tractable in
real-time. Common existing paradigms for dimensionality reduction include
linear methods, such as the singular value decomposition (SVD), and nonlinear
methods, such as variants of convolutional autoencoders (CAE). However, these
encoding techniques lack the ability to efficiently represent the complexity
associated with spatio-temporal data, which often requires variable geometry,
non-uniform grid resolution, adaptive meshing, and/or parametric
dependencies.To resolve these practical engineering challenges, we propose a
general framework called Neural Implicit Flow (NIF) that enables a
mesh-agnostic, low-rank representation of large-scale, parametric,
spatial-temporal data. NIF consists of two modified multilayer perceptrons
(MLPs): (i) ShapeNet, which isolates and represents the spatial complexity, and
(ii) ParameterNet, which accounts for any other input complexity, including
parametric dependencies, time, and sensor measurements. We demonstrate the
utility of NIF for parametric surrogate modeling, enabling the interpretable
representation and compression of complex spatio-temporal dynamics, efficient

modern tricks. It requires no adjustments or hyper-parameters tuning between
different models, and is efficient in terms of training times. We test USI on a
wide variety of architectures, including CNNs, Transformers, Mobile-oriented

results. Hence, we are able to transform training on ImageNet from an
expert-oriented task to an automatic seamless routine. Since USI accepts any
backbone and trains it to top results, it also enables to perform methodical
comparisons, and identify the most efficient backbones along the speed-accuracy
Pareto curve. Implementation is available

limited amount of foresight. Ewerton et al. attain their best performance using
an agent which only takes the most immediate action under consideration. We are
interested in the ability of their models and training algorithms to accurately
predict long-term Q-Values. To evaluate this ability, we design a new bin
sorting task and reward function. Our task requires agents to accurately
estimate future rewards and therefore use high discount factors in their
Q-Value calculation. We investigate the behaviour of an adaptation of the VPG
training algorithm on our task. We show that this adaptation can not accurately
predict the required long-term action sequences. In addition to the limitations
identified by Ewerton et al., it suffers from the known Deep Q-Learning problem
of overestimated Q-Values. In an effort to solve our task, we turn to the
Hourglass models and combine them with the Double Q-Learning approach. We show
that this approach enables the models to accurately predict long-term action
sequences when trained with large discount factors. Our results show that the
Double Q-Learning technique is essential for training with very high discount
factors, as the models Q-Value predictions diverge otherwise. We also

learning technique to improve the zero-shot compositionality of large-scale
pretrained vision-language models (VLMs) without the overhead of fine-tuning
the entire model. VLMs can represent arbitrary classes as natural language
prompts in their flexible text encoders but they underperform state-of-the-art
methods on compositional zero-shot benchmark tasks. To improve VLMs, we propose
a novel form of soft prompting. We treat the attributes and objects that are
composed to define classes as learnable tokens of vocabulary and tune them on
multiple prompt compositions. During inference, we recompose the learned
attribute-object vocabulary in new combinations and show that CSP outperforms
the original VLM on benchmark datasets by an average of 14.7 percentage points
of accuracy. CSP also achieves new state-of-the-art accuracies on two out of
three benchmark datasets, while only fine-tuning a small number of parameters.
Further, we show that CSP improves generalization to higher-order
attribute-attribute-object compositions and combinations of pretrained
attributes and fine-tuned objects.]]></summary>

Roberta or GPT-3 has allowed to address highly complex tasks in a plethora of
scenarios. However, when applied to specific domains, these models encounter
considerable difficulties. This is the case of Social Networks such as Twitter,
an ever-changing stream of information written with informal and complex
language, where each message requires careful evaluation to be understood even
by humans given the important role that context plays. Addressing tasks in this
domain through Natural Language Processing involves severe challenges. When
powerful state-of-the-art multilingual language models are applied to this
scenario, language specific nuances use to get lost in translation. To face
these challenges we present \textbf{BERTuit}, the larger transformer proposed
so far for Spanish language, pre-trained on a massive dataset of 230M Spanish
tweets using RoBERTa optimization. Our motivation is to provide a powerful
resource to better understand Spanish Twitter and to be used on applications
focused on this social network, with special emphasis on solutions devoted to
tackle the spreading of misinformation in this platform. BERTuit is evaluated
on several tasks and compared against M-BERT, XLM-RoBERTa and XLM-T, very
competitive multilingual transformers. The utility of our approach is shown
with applications, in this case: a zero-shot methodology to visualize groups of
hoaxes and profiling authors spreading disinformation.

Misinformation spreads wildly on platforms such as Twitter in languages other
than English, meaning performance of transformers may suffer when transferred
outside English speaking communities.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Various neural network models have been proposed to tackle combinatorial
optimization problems such as the travelling salesman problem (TSP). Existing
learning-based TSP methods adopt a simple setting that the training and testing
data are independent and identically distributed. However, the existing
literature fails to solve TSP instances when training and testing data have
different distributions. Concretely, we find that different training and
testing distribution will result in more difficult TSP instances, i.e., the
solution obtained by the model has a large gap from the optimal solution. To
tackle this problem, in this work, we study learning-based TSP methods when
training and testing data have different distributions using adaptive-hardness,
i.e., how difficult a TSP instance can be for a solver. This problem is
challenging because it is non-trivial to (1) define hardness measurement
quantitatively; (2) efficiently and continuously generate sufficiently hard TSP
instances upon model training; (3) fully utilize instances with different
levels of hardness to learn a more powerful TSP solver. To solve these
challenges, we first propose a principled hardness measurement to quantify the
hardness of TSP instances. Then, we propose a hardness-adaptive generator to
generate instances with different hardness. We further propose a curriculum
learner fully utilizing these instances to train the TSP solver. Experiments
show that our hardness-adaptive generator can generate instances ten times
harder than the existing methods, and our proposed method achieves significant
improvement over state-of-the-art models in terms of the optimality gap.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We investigate and leverage a connection between Differential Privacy (DP)
and the recently proposed notion of Distributional Generalization (DG).
Applying this connection, we introduce new conceptual tools for designing
deep-learning methods that bypass "pathologies" of standard stochastic gradient
descent (SGD). First, we prove that differentially private methods satisfy a
"What You See Is What You Get (WYSIWYG)" generalization guarantee: whatever a
model does on its train data is almost exactly what it will do at test time.
This guarantee is formally captured by distributional generalization. WYSIWYG
enables principled algorithm design in deep learning by reducing
$\textit{generalization}$ concerns to $\textit{optimization}$ ones: in order to
mitigate unwanted behavior at test time, it is provably sufficient to mitigate
this behavior on the train data. This is notably false for standard (non-DP)
methods, hence this observation has applications even when privacy is not
required. For example, importance sampling is known to fail for standard SGD,
but we show that it has exactly the intended effect for DP-trained models.
Thus, with DP-SGD, unlike with SGD, we can influence test-time behavior by
making principled train-time interventions. We use these insights to construct
simple algorithms which match or outperform SOTA in several distributional
robustness applications, and to significantly improve the privacy vs. disparate
impact trade-off of DP-SGD. Finally, we also improve on known theoretical
bounds relating differential privacy, stability, and distributional
generalization.]]></summary>

machine learning algorithms have been widely applied in high-dimensional
dynamical systems to improve the algorithmic efficiency. In this paper, we
develop a system which combines reduced-order surrogate models with a novel
data assimilation (DA) technique used to incorporate real-time observations
from different physical spaces. We make use of local smooth surrogate functions
which link the space of encoded system variables and the one of current
observations to perform variational DA with a low computational cost. The new
system, named Generalised Latent Assimilation can benefit both the efficiency
provided by the reduced-order modelling and the accuracy of data assimilation.
A theoretical analysis of the difference between surrogate and original
assimilation cost function is also provided in this paper where an upper bound,
depending on the size of the local training set, is given. The new approach is
tested on a high-dimensional CFD application of a two-phase liquid flow with
non-linear observation operators that current Latent Assimilation methods can
not handle. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed assimilation
approach can significantly improve the reconstruction and prediction accuracy
of the deep learning surrogate model which is nearly 1000 times faster than the

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[High-contrast imaging of exoplanets hinges on powerful post-processing
methods to denoise the data and separate the signal of a companion from its
host star, which is typically orders of magnitude brighter. Existing
post-processing algorithms do not use all prior domain knowledge that is
available about the problem. We propose a new method that builds on our
understanding of the systematic noise and the causal structure of the
data-generating process. Our algorithm is based on a modified version of
half-sibling regression (HSR), a flexible denoising framework that combines
ideas from the fields of machine learning and causality. We adapt the method to
address the specific requirements of high-contrast exoplanet imaging data
obtained in pupil tracking mode. The key idea is to estimate the systematic
noise in a pixel by regressing the time series of this pixel onto a set of
causally independent, signal-free predictor pixels. We use regularized linear
models in this work; however, other (non-linear) models are also possible. In a
second step, we demonstrate how the HSR framework allows us to incorporate
observing conditions such as wind speed or air temperature as additional
predictors. When we apply our method to four data sets from the VLT/NACO
instrument, our algorithm provides a better false-positive fraction than
PCA-based PSF subtraction, a popular baseline method in the field.
Additionally, we find that the HSR-based method provides direct and accurate
estimates for the contrast of the exoplanets without the need to insert
artificial companions for calibration in the data sets. Finally, we present
first evidence that using the observing conditions as additional predictors can
improve the results. Our HSR-based method provides an alternative, flexible and
promising approach to the challenge of modeling and subtracting the stellar PSF
and systematic noise in exoplanet imaging data.]]></summary>

weaknesses due to the vulnerabilities in the wireless medium. Machine learning
(ML)-based methods are widely used against cyber threats in IoT networks with
promising performance. Advanced persistent threat (APT) is prominent for
cybercriminals to compromise networks, and it is crucial to long-term and
harmful characteristics. However, it is difficult to apply ML-based approaches
to identify APT attacks to obtain a promising detection performance due to an
extremely small percentage among normal traffic. There are limited surveys to
fully investigate APT attacks in IoT networks due to the lack of public
datasets with all types of APT attacks. It is worth to bridge the
state-of-the-art in network attack detection with APT attack detection in a
comprehensive review article. This survey article reviews the security
challenges in IoT networks and presents the well-known attacks, APT attacks,
and threat models in IoT systems. Meanwhile, signature-based, anomaly-based,
and hybrid intrusion detection systems are summarized for IoT networks. The
article highlights statistical insights regarding frequently applied ML-based
methods against network intrusion alongside the number of attacks types
detected. Finally, open issues and challenges for common network intrusion and
APT attacks are presented for future research.]]></summary>

amount of data, as each model is trained from scratch for each task/data set.
Leveraging learning experience with similar datasets is a well-established
technique for classification problems called few-shot classification. However,
existing approaches cannot be applied to time-series forecasting because i)
multivariate time-series datasets have different channels and ii) forecasting
is principally different from classification. In this paper we formalize the
problem of few-shot forecasting of time-series with heterogeneous channels for
the first time. Extending recent work on heterogeneous attributes in vector
data, we develop a model composed of permutation-invariant deep set-blocks
which incorporate a temporal embedding. We assemble the first meta-dataset of
40 multivariate time-series datasets and show through experiments that our
model provides a good generalization, outperforming baselines carried over from
simpler scenarios that either fail to learn across tasks or miss temporal
information.]]></summary>

data from a similar but different domain than the data it has initially been
trained on. To mitigate this domain shift problem, domain adaptation (DA)
techniques search for an optimal transformation that converts the (current)
input data from a source domain to a target domain to learn a domain-invariant
representations that reduces domain discrepancy.

This paper proposes a novel supervised domain adaptation based on two steps.
First, we search for an optimal class-dependent transformation from the source
to the target domain from a few samples. We consider optimal transport methods
such as the earth mover distance with Laplacian regularization, Sinkhorn
transport and correlation alignment. Second, we use embedding similarity
techniques to select the corresponding transformation at inference. We use
correlation metrics and maximum mean discrepancy with higher-order moment
matching techniques. We conduct an extensive evaluation on time-series datasets
with domain shift including simulated and various online handwriting datasets
to demonstrate the performance.]]></summary>

devices are of great interest in IoT applications, as they can reduce network
pressure and response latency, and improve privacy. An effective way to obtain
energy-efficiency with small accuracy drops is to sequentially execute a set of
increasingly complex models, early-stopping the procedure for "easy" inputs
that can be confidently classified by the smallest models. As a stopping
criterion, current methods employ a single threshold on the output
probabilities produced by each model. In this work, we show that such a
criterion is sub-optimal for datasets that include classes of different
complexity, and we demonstrate a more general approach based on per-classes
thresholds. With experiments on a low-power end-node, we show that our method
can significantly reduce the energy consumption compared to the
single-threshold approach.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Currently, pre-trained models can be considered the default choice for a wide
range of NLP tasks. Despite their SoTA results, there is practical evidence
that these models may require a different number of computing layers for
different input sequences, since evaluating all layers leads to overconfidence
on wrong predictions (namely overthinking). This problem can potentially be
solved by implementing adaptive computation time approaches, which were first
designed to improve inference speed. Recently proposed PonderNet may be a
promising solution for performing an early exit by treating the exit layers
index as a latent variable. However, the originally proposed exit criterion,
relying on sampling from trained posterior distribution on the probability of
exiting from i-th layer, introduces major variance in model outputs,
significantly reducing the resulting models performance. In this paper, we
propose Ponder ALBERT (PALBERT): an improvement to PonderNet with a novel
deterministic Q-exit criterion and a revisited model architecture. We compared
PALBERT with recent methods for performing an early exit. We observed that the
proposed changes can be considered significant improvements on the original
PonderNet architecture and outperform PABEE on a wide range of GLUE tasks. In
addition, we also performed an in-depth ablation study of the proposed
architecture to further understand Lambda layers and their performance.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Nowadays, deep neural networks are being used in many domains because of
their high accuracy results. However, they are considered as "black box", means
that they are not explainable for humans. On the other hand, in some tasks such
as medical, economic, and self-driving cars, users want the model to be
interpretable to decide if they can trust these results or not. In this work,
we present a modified version of an autoencoder-based approach for local
interpretability called ALIME. The ALIME itself is inspired by a famous method
called Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations (LIME). LIME generates a
single instance level explanation by generating new data around the instance
and training a local linear interpretable model. ALIME uses an autoencoder to
weigh the new data around the sample. Nevertheless, the ALIME uses a linear
model as the interpretable model to be trained locally, just like the LIME.
This work proposes a new approach, which uses a decision tree instead of the
linear model, as the interpretable model. We evaluate the proposed model in
case of stability, local fidelity, and interpretability on different datasets.
Compared to ALIME, the experiments show significant results on stability and
local fidelity and improved results on interpretability.]]></summary>

1 diabetes (T1D). These devices usually utilise simple control algorithms to
select the optimal insulin dose for maintaining blood glucose levels within a
healthy range. Online reinforcement learning (RL) has been utilised as a method
for further enhancing glucose control in these devices. Previous approaches
have been shown to reduce patient risk and improve time spent in the target
range when compared to classical control algorithms, but are prone to
instability in the learning process, often resulting in the selection of unsafe
actions. This work presents an evaluation of offline RL as a means for
developing clinically effective dosing policies without the need for patient
interaction. This paper examines the utility of BCQ, CQL and TD3-BC in managing
the blood glucose of nine virtual patients within the UVA/Padova glucose
dynamics simulator. When trained on less than a tenth of the data required by
online RL approaches, this work shows that offline RL can significantly
increase time in the healthy blood glucose range when compared to the strongest
state-of-art baseline. This is achieved without any associated increase in low
blood glucose events. Offline RL is also shown to be able to correct for common
and challenging scenarios such as incorrect bolus dosing, irregular meal
timings and sub-optimal training data.]]></summary>

practical but also theoretical problems. Based on this, the young research
field of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) has emerged. Despite the youth of the
field and the speed in which new models are developed, many good surveys have
been published in the last years. Nevertheless, an overview on which graph
types can be modeled by GNNs is missing. In this survey, we give a detailed
overview of already existing GNNs and, unlike previous surveys, categorize them
according to their ability to handle different graph types. We consider GNNs
operating on static as well as on dynamic graphs of different structural
constitutions, with or without node or edge attributes. Moreover in the dynamic
case, we separate the models in discrete-time and continuous-time dynamic
graphs based on their architecture. According to our findings, there are still
graph types, that are not covered by existing GNN models. Specifically, models
concerning heterogeneity in attributes are missing and the deletion of nodes
and edges is only covered rarely.]]></summary>

knowledge from a well-trained source model to a related but unlabeled target
domain. In such a scenario, all conventional adaptation methods that require
source data fail. To combat this challenge, existing USFDAs turn to transfer
knowledge by aligning the target feature to the latent distribution hidden in
the source model. However, such information is naturally limited. Thus, the
alignment in such a scenario is not only difficult but also insufficient, which
degrades the target generalization performance. To relieve this dilemma in
current USFDAs, we are motivated to explore a new perspective to boost their
performance. For this purpose and gaining necessary insight, we look back upon
the origin of the domain adaptation and first theoretically derive a new-brand
target generalization error bound based on the model smoothness. Then,
following the theoretical insight, a general and model-smoothness-guided
Jacobian norm (JN) regularizer is designed and imposed on the target domain to
mitigate this dilemma. Extensive experiments are conducted to validate its
effectiveness. In its implementation, just with a few lines of codes added to
the existing USFDAs, we achieve superior results on various benchmark datasets.]]></summary>

currently hampered by limitations in data availability. Distributed learning
methods such as federated learning (FL) and shared learning (SL) are introduced
to solve this problem as well as data management and ownership issues with

split task-agnostic (FeSTA) learning tries to reconcile the distinct merits of
FL and SL by enabling the multi-task collaboration between participants through
Vision Transformer (ViT) architecture, but they suffer from higher
communication overhead. To address this, here we present a multi-task

a CNN based head as in FeSTA, p-FeSTA adopts a randomly permuting simple patch
embedder, improving the multi-task learning performance without sacrificing

equivalence between two programs made of sequences of statements. We represent
programs using abstract syntax trees (AST), where a given set of
semantics-preserving rewrite rules can be applied on a specific AST pattern to
generate a transformed and semantically equivalent program. In our system, two
programs are equivalent if there exists a sequence of application of these
rewrite rules that leads to rewriting one program into the other. We propose a
neural network architecture based on a transformer model to generate proofs of
equivalence between program pairs. The system outputs a sequence of rewrites,
and the validity of the sequence is simply checked by verifying it can be
applied. If no valid sequence is produced by the neural network, the system
reports the programs as non-equivalent, ensuring by design no programs may be
incorrectly reported as equivalent. Our system is fully implemented for a given
grammar. To efficiently train the system to generate such sequences, we develop
an original incremental training technique, named self-supervised sample
selection. We extensively study the effectiveness of this novel training
approach on proofs of increasing complexity and length. Our system, S4Eq,

for the challenging and underexplored tasks of texture transfer and synthesis.
Previous works either apply spherical texture maps which may lead to large
distortions, or use continuous texture fields that yield smooth outputs lacking
details. We argue that the traditional way of representing textures with images
and linking them to a 3D mesh via UV mapping is more desirable, since
synthesizing 2D images is a well-studied problem. We propose AUV-Net which
learns to embed 3D surfaces into a 2D aligned UV space, by mapping the
corresponding semantic parts of different 3D shapes to the same location in the
UV space. As a result, textures are aligned across objects, and can thus be
easily synthesized by generative models of images. Texture alignment is learned
in an unsupervised manner by a simple yet effective texture alignment module,
taking inspiration from traditional works on linear subspace learning. The
learned UV mapping and aligned texture representations enable a variety of
applications including texture transfer, texture synthesis, and textured single
view 3D reconstruction. We conduct experiments on multiple datasets to
demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. Project page:

bandwidths, heterogeneity in data distributions and computational resources, as

dual variables to tackle statistical heterogeneity, and accommodates system
heterogeneity by tolerating variable amount of work performed by clients.
FedADMM maintains identical communication costs per round as FedAvg/Prox, and
generalizes them via the augmented Lagrangian. A convergence proof is
established for nonconvex objectives, under no restrictions in terms of data
dissimilarity or number of participants per round of the algorithm. We
demonstrate the merits through extensive experiments on real datasets, under
both IID and non-IID data distributions across clients. FedADMM consistently
outperforms all baseline methods in terms of communication efficiency, with the
number of rounds needed to reach a prescribed accuracy reduced by up to 87%.
The algorithm effectively adapts to heterogeneous data distributions through
the use of dual variables, without the need for hyperparameter tuning, and its

unsatisfactory. Beside the CTR tensor, additional ad features or user

Covariate-assisted Sparse Tensor Completion (COSTCO) to incorporate covariate

extract latent components from both the tensor and the covariate matrix to
learn a synthetic representation. Theoretically, we derive the error bound for
the recovered tensor components and explicitly quantify the improvements on
both the reveal probability condition and the tensor recovery accuracy due to
covariates. Finally, we apply COSTCO to an advertisement dataset consisting of

data analysis that involves diagonalizing the covariance matrix of the dataset.
Recently, quantum algorithms have been formulated for PCA based on
diagonalizing a density matrix. These algorithms assume that the covariance
matrix can be encoded in a density matrix, but a concrete protocol for this
encoding has been lacking. Our work aims to address this gap. Assuming
amplitude encoding of the data, with the data given by the ensemble $\{p_i,|
\psi_i \rangle\}$, then one can easily prepare the ensemble average density
matrix $\overline{\rho} = \sum_i p_i |\psi_i\rangle \langle \psi_i |$. We first
show that $\overline{\rho}$ is precisely the covariance matrix whenever the
dataset is centered. For quantum datasets, we exploit global phase symmetry to
argue that there always exists a centered dataset consistent with
$\overline{\rho}$, and hence $\overline{\rho}$ can always be interpreted as a
covariance matrix. This provides a simple means for preparing the covariance
matrix for arbitrary quantum datasets or centered classical datasets. For
uncentered classical datasets, our method is so-called "PCA without centering",
which we interpret as PCA on a symmetrized dataset. We argue that this closely
corresponds to standard PCA, and we derive equations and inequalities that
bound the deviation of the spectrum obtained with our method from that of
standard PCA. We numerically illustrate our method for the MNIST handwritten
digit dataset. We also argue that PCA on quantum datasets is natural and
meaningful, and we numerically implement our method for molecular ground-state
datasets.]]></summary>

numerical experiments run on a modified IEEE-118 bus network with wind
uncertainty, we show how the power system can substantially benefit from taking
into account the well-known statistical dependence between the point forecast
of wind power outputs and its associated prediction error. Furthermore, the
experiments conducted also reveal that the distributional robustness conferred
on the OPF solution by our probability-trimmings-based approach is superior to
that bestowed by alternative approaches in terms of expected cost and system

the variables are both discrete and continuous. In engineering applications,
the objective function is typically calculated with a numerically costly
black-box simulation.General mixed and costly optimization problems are
therefore of a great practical interest, yet their resolution remains in a
large part an open scientific question. In this article, costly mixed problems
are approached through Gaussian processes where the discrete variables are
relaxed into continuous latent variables. The continuous space is more easily
harvested by classical Bayesian optimization techniques than a mixed space
would. Discrete variables are recovered either subsequently to the continuous
optimization, or simultaneously with an additional continuous-discrete
compatibility constraint that is handled with augmented Lagrangians. Several
possible implementations of such Bayesian mixed optimizers are compared. In
particular, the reformulation of the problem with continuous latent variables
is put in competition with searches working directly in the mixed space. Among
the algorithms involving latent variables and an augmented Lagrangian, a
particular attention is devoted to the Lagrange multipliers for which a local
and a global estimation techniques are studied. The comparisons are based on
the repeated optimization of three analytical functions and a beam design
problem.]]></summary>

finding schemes that can effectively alleviate access congestion has become an
important issue. Recently, many traffic control schemes have been studied.
Nevertheless, the dynamics of traffic and the heterogeneous requirements of
different IoV applications are not considered in most existing studies, which
is significant for the random access resource allocation. In this paper, we
consider a hybrid traffic control scheme and use proximal policy optimization
(PPO) method to tackle it. Firstly, IoV devices are divided into various
classes based on delay characteristics. The target of maximizing the successful
transmission of packets with the success rate constraint is established. Then,
the optimization objective is transformed into a markov decision process (MDP)
model. Finally, the access class barring (ACB) factors are obtained based on
the PPO method to maximize the number of successful access devices. The
performance of the proposal algorithm in respect of successful events and delay

demonstrated significant performance on non-trivial tasks such as speech
recognition, image processing, and natural language understanding. However,
this is at the cost of substantial data requirements. Considering the
widespread proliferation of edge devices (e.g. Internet of Things devices) over
the last decade, Deep Learning in the edge paradigm, such as device-cloud
integrated platforms, is required to leverage its superior performance.
Moreover, it is suitable from the data requirements perspective in the edge
paradigm because the proliferation of edge devices has resulted in an explosion
in the volume of generated and collected data. However, there are difficulties
due to other requirements such as high computation, high latency, and high
bandwidth caused by Deep Learning applications in real-world scenarios. In this
regard, this survey paper investigates Deep Learning at the edge, its
architecture, enabling technologies, and model adaption techniques, where edge
servers and edge devices participate in deep learning training and inference.
For simplicity, we call this paradigm the All-in EDGE paradigm. Besides, this
paper presents the key performance metrics for Deep Learning at the All-in EDGE
paradigm to evaluate various deep learning techniques and choose a suitable
design. Moreover, various open challenges arising from the deployment of Deep
Learning at the All-in EDGE paradigm are identified and discussed.]]></summary>

networks. Most of them are computed by iterations and cannot be interpreted
very well. In contrast, little attentions are paid to basic machine learning
models such as support vector machines. In this paper, we investigate the
optimization models and the interpretations for three types of adversarial
perturbations against support vector machines, including sample-adversarial
perturbations (sAP), class-universal adversarial perturbations (cuAP) as well
as universal adversarial perturbations (uAP). For linear binary/multi
classification support vector machines (SVMs), we derive the explicit solutions
for sAP, cuAP and uAP (binary case), and approximate solution for uAP of
multi-classification. We also obtain the upper bound of fooling rate for uAP.
Such results not only increase the interpretability of the three adversarial

To address this problem, a possible solution is to provide the agent with
information about the past. However, providing complete observations of
numerous steps can be excessive. Inspired by human memory, we propose to
represent history with only important changes in the environment and, in our
approach, to obtain automatically this representation using self-supervision.
Our method (TempAl) aligns temporally-close frames, revealing a general, slowly
varying state of the environment. This procedure is based on contrastive loss,
which pulls embeddings of nearby observations to each other while pushing away
other samples from the batch. It can be interpreted as a metric that captures
the temporal relations of observations. We propose to combine both common
instantaneous and our history representation and we evaluate TempAl on all
available Atari games from the Arcade Learning Environment. TempAl surpasses
the instantaneous-only baseline in 35 environments out of 49. The source code

information between multiple correlated tasks, then it produces better
generalization performance. However, it contains matrix inversion operation
when solving the dual problems, so it costs much running time. Moreover, kernel
trick cannot be directly utilized in the nonlinear case. To effectively avoid
above problems, a novel multi-task nonparallel support vector machine (MTNPSVM)

epsilon-insensitive loss instead of square loss in DMTSVM, MTNPSVM effectively
avoids matrix inversion operation and takes full advantage of the kernel trick.
Theoretical implication of the model is further discussed. To further improve
the computational efficiency, the alternating direction method of multipliers
(ADMM) is employed when solving the dual problem. The computational complexity
and convergence of the algorithm are provided. In addition, the property and
sensitivity of the parameter in model are further explored. The experimental
results on fifteen benchmark datasets and twelve image datasets demonstrate the

spectrum with incumbent users and support various spectrum monitoring tasks
such as anomaly detection, fault diagnostics, user equipment identification,
and authentication. A network of wireless sensors is needed to monitor the
spectrum for signal transmissions of interest over a large deployment area.
Each sensor receives signals under a specific channel condition depending on
its location and trains an individual model of a deep neural network (DNN)
accordingly to classify signals. To improve the accuracy, individual sensors
may exchange sensing data or sensor results with each other or with a fusion
center (such as in cooperative spectrum sensing). In this paper, distributed
federated learning over a multi-hop wireless network is considered to
collectively train a DNN for signal identification. In distributed federated
learning, each sensor broadcasts its trained model to its neighbors, collects
the DNN models from its neighbors, and aggregates them to initialize its own
model for the next round of training. Without exchanging any spectrum data,
this process is repeated over time such that a common DNN is built across the
network while preserving the privacy associated with signals collected at
different locations. Signal classification accuracy and convergence time are
evaluated for different network topologies (including line, star, ring, grid,
and random networks) and packet loss events. Then, the reduction of
communication overhead and energy consumption is considered with random
participation of sensors in model updates. The results show the feasibility of
extending cooperative spectrum sensing over a general multi-hop wireless
network through federated learning and indicate its robustness to wireless
network effects, thereby sustaining high accuracy with low communication
overhead and energy consumption.]]></summary>

improve generalization performances by constraining a model's complexity.
Current Deep Networks heavily rely on regularizers such as Data-Augmentation
(DA) or weight-decay, and employ structural risk minimization, i.e.
cross-validation, to select the optimal regularization hyper-parameters. In
this study, we demonstrate that techniques such as DA or weight decay produce a
model with a reduced complexity that is unfair across classes. The optimal
amount of DA or weight decay found from cross-validation leads to disastrous
model performances on some classes e.g. on Imagenet with a resnet50, the "barn
spider" classification test accuracy falls from $68\%$ to $46\%$ only by
introducing random crop DA during training. Even more surprising, such
performance drop also appears when introducing uninformative regularization
techniques such as weight decay. Those results demonstrate that our search for
ever increasing generalization performance -- averaged over all classes and
samples -- has left us with models and regularizers that silently sacrifice
performances on some classes. This scenario can become dangerous when deploying
a model on downstream tasks e.g. an Imagenet pre-trained resnet50 deployed on
INaturalist sees its performances fall from $70\%$ to $30\%$ on class \#8889
when introducing random crop DA during the Imagenet pre-training phase. Those
results demonstrate that designing novel regularizers without class-dependent

amount of knowledge from the pre-training corpora; however, they are still
limited in recalling factually correct knowledge given a certain context.
Hence, they tend to suffer from counterfactual or hallucinatory generation when
used in knowledge-intensive natural language generation (NLG) tasks. Recent
remedies to this problem focus on modifying either the pre-training or task
fine-tuning objectives to incorporate knowledge, which normally require
additional costly training or architecture modification of LMs for practical
applications. We present Knowledge Infused Decoding (KID) -- a novel decoding
algorithm for generative LMs, which dynamically infuses external knowledge into
each step of the LM decoding. Specifically, we maintain a local knowledge
memory based on the current context, interacting with a dynamically created
external knowledge trie, and continuously update the local memory as a
knowledge-aware constraint to guide decoding via reinforcement learning. On six
diverse knowledge-intensive NLG tasks, task-agnostic LMs (e.g., GPT-2 and BART)
armed with KID outperform many task-optimized state-of-the-art models, and show
particularly strong performance in few-shot scenarios over seven related
knowledge-infusion techniques. Human evaluation confirms KID's ability to
generate more relevant and factual language for the input context when compared
with multiple baselines. Finally, KID also alleviates exposure bias and
provides stable generation quality when generating longer sequences. Code for
KID is available at https://github.com/microsoft/KID.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Considering the natural frequency characteristics in sleep medicine, this
paper first proposes a time-frequency framework for the representation learning
of the electroencephalogram (EEG) following the definition of the American
Academy of Sleep Medicine. To meet the temporal-random and transient nature of
the defining characteristics of sleep stages, we further design a
context-sensitive flexible pipeline that automatically adapts to the attributes
of data itself. That is, the input EEG spectrogram is partitioned into a
sequence of patches in the time and frequency axes, and then input to a
delicate deep learning network for further representation learning to extract
the stage-dependent features, which are used in the classification step
finally. The proposed pipeline is validated against a large database, i.e., the
Sleep Heart Health Study (SHHS), and the results demonstrate that the
competitive performance for the wake, N2, and N3 stages outperforms the
state-of-art works, with the F1 scores being 0.93, 0.88, and 0.87,
respectively, and the proposed method has a high inter-rater reliability of
0.80 kappa. Importantly, we visualize the stage scoring process of the model
decision with the Layer-wise Relevance Propagation (LRP) method, which shows
that the proposed pipeline is more sensitive and perceivable in the
decision-making process than the baseline pipelines. Therefore, the pipeline
together with the LRP method can provide better model interpretability, which
is important for clinical support.]]></summary>

in generative modeling research. We make progress towards this milestone by
proposing a diffusion model for video generation that shows very promising

diffusion architecture, and it enables jointly training from image and video
data, which we find to reduce the variance of minibatch gradients and speed up
optimization. To generate long and higher resolution videos we introduce a new
conditional sampling technique for spatial and temporal video extension that
performs better than previously proposed methods. We present the first results
on a large text-conditioned video generation task, as well as state-of-the-art

While deep learning models achieve superior performance, often statistically
better than humans, their adoption into safety-critical settings, such as
healthcare or self-driving cars is hindered by their inability to provide
safety guarantees or to expose the inner workings of the model in a human
understandable form. We present Mo\"ET, a novel model based on Mixture of
Experts, consisting of decision tree experts and a generalized linear model
gating function. Thanks to such gating function the model is more expressive
than the standard decision tree. To support non-differentiable decision trees
as experts, we formulate a novel training procedure. In addition, we introduce
a hard thresholding version, Mo\"ETH, in which predictions are made solely by a
single expert chosen via the gating function. Thanks to that property, Mo\"ETH
allows each prediction to be easily decomposed into a set of logical rules in a
form which can be easily verified. While Mo\"ET is a general use model, we
illustrate its power in the reinforcement learning setting. By training Mo\"ET
models using an imitation learning procedure on deep RL agents we outperform
the previous state-of-the-art technique based on decision trees while
preserving the verifiability of the models. Moreover, we show that Mo\"ET can
also be used in real-world supervised problems on which it outperforms other
verifiable machine learning models.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[With the surge in the number of hyperparameters and training times of modern
machine learning models, hyperparameter tuning is becoming increasingly
expensive. However, after assessing 40 tuning methods systematically, we find
that each faces certain limitations. In particular, methods that speed up
tuning via knowledge transfer typically require the final performance of
hyperparameters and do not focus on low-fidelity information. As we demonstrate
empirically, this common practice is suboptimal and can incur an unnecessary
use of resources. It is more cost-efficient to instead leverage low-fidelity
tuning observations to measure inter-task similarity and transfer knowledge
from existing to new tasks accordingly. However, performing multi-fidelity
tuning comes with its own challenges in the transfer setting: the noise in
additional observations and the need for performance forecasting. Therefore, we
propose and conduct a thorough analysis of a multi-task multi-fidelity Bayesian
optimization framework, which leads to the best instantiation--amortized
auto-tuning (AT2). We further present an offline-computed 27-task
hyperparameter recommendation (HyperRec) database to serve the community.
Extensive experiments on HyperRec and other real-world databases illustrate the

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We study the basic operation of set union in the global model of differential
privacy. In this problem, we are given a universe $U$ of items, possibly of
infinite size, and a database $D$ of users. Each user $i$ contributes a subset
$W_i \subseteq U$ of items. We want an ($\epsilon$,$\delta$)-differentially
private algorithm which outputs a subset $S \subset \cup_i W_i$ such that the
size of $S$ is as large as possible. The problem arises in countless real world
applications; it is particularly ubiquitous in natural language processing
(NLP) applications as vocabulary extraction. For example, discovering words,
sentences, $n$-grams etc., from private text data belonging to users is an
instance of the set union problem.

Known algorithms for this problem proceed by collecting a subset of items
from each user, taking the union of such subsets, and disclosing the items
whose noisy counts fall above a certain threshold. Crucially, in the above
process, the contribution of each individual user is always independent of the
items held by other users, resulting in a wasteful aggregation process, where
some item counts happen to be way above the threshold. We deviate from the
above paradigm by allowing users to contribute their items in a
$\textit{dependent fashion}$, guided by a $\textit{policy}$. In this new
setting ensuring privacy is significantly delicate. We prove that any policy
which has certain $\textit{contractive}$ properties would result in a
differentially private algorithm. We design two new algorithms, one using
Laplace noise and other Gaussian noise, as specific instances of policies
satisfying the contractive properties. Our experiments show that the new
algorithms significantly outperform previously known mechanisms for the
problem.]]></summary>

tool in solving tasks across various fields of application. The success of DNNs
is strongly connected to their high complexity in terms of the number of
network layers or of neurons in each layer, which severely complicates to
understand how DNNs solve their learned task. To improve the explainability of
DNNs, we adapt methods from neuroscience because this field has a rich
experience in analyzing complex and opaque systems. In this work, we draw
inspiration from how neuroscience uses topographic maps to visualize the
activity of the brain when it performs certain tasks. Transferring this
approach to DNNs can help to visualize and understand their internal processes
more intuitively, too. However, the inner structures of brains and DNNs differ
substantially. Therefore, to be able to visualize activations of neurons in
DNNs as topographic maps, we research techniques to layout the neurons in a
two-dimensional space in which neurons of similar activity are in the vicinity
of each other. In this work, we introduce and compare different methods to
obtain a topographic layout of the neurons in a network layer. Moreover, we
demonstrate how to use the resulting topographic activation maps to identify
errors or encoded biases in DNNs or data sets. Our novel visualization
technique improves the transparency of DNN-based algorithmic decision-making
systems and is accessible to a broad audience because topographic maps are
intuitive to interpret without expert-knowledge in Machine Learning.]]></summary>

improve generalization performances by constraining a model's complexity.
Current Deep Networks heavily rely on regularizers such as Data-Augmentation
(DA) or weight-decay, and employ structural risk minimization, i.e.
cross-validation, to select the optimal regularization hyper-parameters. In
this study, we demonstrate that techniques such as DA or weight decay produce a
model with a reduced complexity that is unfair across classes. The optimal
amount of DA or weight decay found from cross-validation leads to disastrous
model performances on some classes e.g. on Imagenet with a resnet50, the "barn
spider" classification test accuracy falls from $68\%$ to $46\%$ only by
introducing random crop DA during training. Even more surprising, such
performance drop also appears when introducing uninformative regularization
techniques such as weight decay. Those results demonstrate that our search for
ever increasing generalization performance -- averaged over all classes and
samples -- has left us with models and regularizers that silently sacrifice
performances on some classes. This scenario can become dangerous when deploying
a model on downstream tasks e.g. an Imagenet pre-trained resnet50 deployed on
INaturalist sees its performances fall from $70\%$ to $30\%$ on class \#8889
when introducing random crop DA during the Imagenet pre-training phase. Those
results demonstrate that designing novel regularizers without class-dependent
bias remains an open research question.]]></summary>

(DBV) are more ambiguously determined from the data. As such, existing
inference methods tend to yield very noisy and underestimated OEF maps, while
overestimating DBV.

This work describes a novel probabilistic machine learning approach that can
infer plausible distributions of OEF and DBV. Initially, we create a model that
produces informative voxelwise prior distribution based on synthetic training
data. Contrary to prior work, we model the joint distribution of OEF and DBV
through a scaled multivariate logit-Normal distribution, which enables the
values to be constrained within a plausible range. The prior distribution model
is used to train an efficient amortized variational Bayesian inference model.
This model learns to infer OEF and DBV by predicting real image data, with few
training data required, using the signal equations as a forward model.

We demonstrate that our approach enables the inference of smooth OEF and DBV
maps, with a physiologically plausible distribution that can be adapted through
specification of an informative prior distribution. Other benefits include
model comparison (via the evidence lower bound) and uncertainty quantification
for identifying image artefacts. Results are demonstrated on a small study
comparing subjects undergoing hyperventilation and at rest. We illustrate that
the proposed approach allows measurement of gray matter differences in OEF and
DBV and enables voxelwise comparison between conditions, where we observe
significant increases in OEF and $R_2^\prime$ during hyperventilation.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Multi-view unsupervised feature selection has been proven to be efficient in
reducing the dimensionality of multi-view unlabeled data with high dimensions.
The previous methods assume all of the views are complete. However, in real
applications, the multi-view data are often incomplete, i.e., some views of
instances are missing, which will result in the failure of these methods.
Besides, while the data arrive in form of streams, these existing methods will
suffer the issues of high storage cost and expensive computation time. To
address these issues, we propose an Incremental Incomplete Multi-view
Unsupervised Feature Selection method (I$^2$MUFS) on incomplete multi-view
streaming data. By jointly considering the consistent and complementary
information across different views, I$^2$MUFS embeds the unsupervised feature
selection into an extended weighted non-negative matrix factorization model,
which can learn a consensus clustering indicator matrix and fuse different
latent feature matrices with adaptive view weights. Furthermore, we introduce
the incremental leaning mechanisms to develop an alternative iterative
algorithm, where the feature selection matrix is incrementally updated, rather
than recomputing on the entire updated data from scratch. A series of
experiments are conducted to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method by
comparing with several state-of-the-art methods. The experimental results
demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed method in terms of
the clustering metrics and the computational cost.]]></summary>

a given natural language query. Recently, large-scale code pre-trained models
such as CodeBERT and GraphCodeBERT learn generic representations of source code
and have achieved substantial improvement on code search task. However, the
high-quality sequence-level representations of code snippets have not been
sufficiently explored. In this paper, we propose a new approach with multimodal
contrastive learning and soft data augmentation for code search. Multimodal
contrastive learning is used to pull together the representations of code-query
pairs and push apart the unpaired code snippets and queries. Moreover, data
augmentation is critical in contrastive learning for learning high-quality
representations. However, only semantic-preserving augmentations for source
code are considered in existing work. In this work, we propose to do soft data
augmentation by dynamically masking and replacing some tokens in code sequences
to generate code snippets that are similar but not necessarily
semantic-preserving as positive samples for paired queries. We conduct
extensive experiments to evaluate the effectiveness of our approach on a
large-scale dataset with six programming languages. The experimental results
show that our approach significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods.
We also adapt our techniques to several pre-trained models such as RoBERTa and

modelling technique for approximating expensive computational models. However,
it tends to get impractical for high-dimensional problems due to the large
inherent correlation matrix and the associated high-dimensional hyper-parameter
tuning problem. To address these issues, we propose a new method in this paper,
called sliced GE-Kriging (SGE-Kriging) for reducing both the size of the
correlation matrix and the number of hyper-parameters. Firstly, we perform a
derivative-based global sensitivity analysis to detect the relative importance
of each input variable with respect to model response. Then, we propose to
split the training sample set into multiple slices, and invoke Bayes' theorem
to approximate the full likelihood function via a sliced likelihood function,
in which multiple small correlation matrices are utilized to describe the
correlation of the sample set. Additionally, we replace the original
high-dimensional hyper-parameter tuning problem with a low-dimensional
counterpart by learning the relationship between the hyper-parameters and the
global sensitivity indices. Finally, we validate SGE-Kriging by means of
numerical experiments with several benchmarks problems. The results show that
the SGE-Kriging model features an accuracy and robustness that is comparable to
the standard one but comes at much less training costs. The benefits are most
evident in high-dimensional problems.]]></summary>

family with unknown parameters. We ask the following question: when is it
possible to split $X$ into two parts $f(X)$ and $g(X)$ such that neither part
is sufficient to reconstruct $X$ by itself, but both together can recover $X$
fully, and the joint distribution of $(f(X),g(X))$ is tractable? As one
example, if $X=(X_1,\dots,X_n)$ and $P$ is a product distribution, then for any
$m<n$, we can split the sample to define $f(X)=(X_1,\dots,X_m)$ and
$g(X)=(X_{m+1},\dots,X_n)$. Rasines and Young (2021) offers an alternative
route of accomplishing this task through randomization of $X$ with additive
Gaussian noise which enables post-selection inference in finite samples for
Gaussian distributed data and asymptotically for non-Gaussian additive models.
In this paper, we offer a more general methodology for achieving such a split
in finite samples by borrowing ideas from Bayesian inference to yield a
(frequentist) solution that can be viewed as a continuous analog of data
splitting. We call our method data blurring, as an alternative to data
splitting, data carving and p-value masking. We exemplify the method on a few
prototypical applications, such as post-selection inference for trend filtering

intelligence. It is often inefficient to conduct reasoning and inference
directly in the space of raw sensory representations, such as pixel values of
images. Representation learning allows us to automatically discover suitable
representations from raw sensory data. For example, given raw sensory data, a
deep neural network learns nonlinear representations at its hidden layers,
which are subsequently used for classification at its output layer. This
happens implicitly during training through minimizing a supervised or
unsupervised loss. In this paper, we study the dynamics of such implicit
nonlinear representation learning. We identify a pair of a new assumption and a
novel condition, called the common model structure assumption and the
data-architecture alignment condition. Under the common model structure
assumption, the data-architecture alignment condition is shown to be sufficient
for the global convergence and necessary for the global optimality. Moreover,
our theory explains how and when increasing the network size does and does not
improve the training behaviors in the practical regime. Our results provide
practical guidance for designing a model structure: e.g., the common model
structure assumption can be used as a justification for using a particular
model structure instead of others. We also derive a new training framework,
which satisfies the data-architecture alignment condition by automatically
modifying any given training algorithm. Given a standard training algorithm,
the framework running its modified version is empirically shown to maintain
competitive test performances while providing global convergence guarantees for
deep residual neural networks with convolutions, skip connections, and batch
normalization with datasets, including MNIST, CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, Semeion,
KMNIST and SVHN.]]></summary>

However, VICReg is proposed in computer vision and it learns by pulling

representation space by the variance and covariance loss. However, VICReg would
be ineffective on non-stationary time series where different parts/crops of

matrices that have shared rows and/or columns. For example, cancer studies that
integrate multiple omics platforms across multiple types of cancer, pan-omics
pan-cancer analysis, have extended our knowledge of molecular heterogenity
beyond what was observed in single tumor and single platform studies. However,
these studies have been limited by available statistical methodology. We
propose a flexible approach to the simultaneous factorization and decomposition
of variation across such bidimensionally linked matrices, BIDIFAC+. This
decomposes variation into a series of low-rank components that may be shared
across any number of row sets (e.g., omics platforms) or column sets (e.g.,
cancer types). This builds on a growing literature for the factorization and
decomposition of linked matrices, which has primarily focused on multiple
matrices that are linked in one dimension (rows or columns) only. Our objective
function extends nuclear norm penalization, is motivated by random matrix
theory, gives an identifiable decomposition under relatively mild conditions,
and can be shown to give the mode of a Bayesian posterior distribution. We
apply BIDIFAC+ to pan-omics pan-cancer data from TCGA, identifying shared and
specific modes of variability across 4 different omics platforms and 29
different cancer types.]]></summary>

risk-averse control off the shelf, in both on- and off-policy settings. This
flexibility reduces the gap between risk-neutral control and risk-averse

vanilla TD3 and many previous risk-averse control methods in challenging Mujoco

system identification techniques. They may be applied to linear and nonlinear
systems, and they require fewer modeling assumptions. However, these neural
network models may also need larger amounts of data to learn and generalize.
Furthermore, neural networks training is a time-consuming process. Hence,
building upon long-short term memory neural networks (LSTM), this paper
proposes using two types of deep transfer learning, namely parameter
fine-tuning and freezing, to reduce the data and computation requirements for
system identification. We apply these techniques to identify two dynamical
systems, namely a second-order linear system and a Wiener-Hammerstein nonlinear

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[DeepTensor is a computationally efficient framework for low-rank
decomposition of matrices and tensors using deep generative networks. We
decompose a tensor as the product of low-rank tensor factors (e.g., a matrix as
the outer product of two vectors), where each low-rank tensor is generated by a
deep network (DN) that is trained in a self-supervised manner to minimize the
mean-squared approximation error. Our key observation is that the implicit
regularization inherent in DNs enables them to capture nonlinear signal
structures (e.g., manifolds) that are out of the reach of classical linear
methods like the singular value decomposition (SVD) and principal component
analysis (PCA). Furthermore, in contrast to the SVD and PCA, whose performance
deteriorates when the tensor's entries deviate from additive white Gaussian
noise, we demonstrate that the performance of DeepTensor is robust to a wide
range of distributions. We validate that DeepTensor is a robust and
computationally efficient drop-in replacement for the SVD, PCA, nonnegative
matrix factorization (NMF), and similar decompositions by exploring a range of
real-world applications, including hyperspectral image denoising, 3D MRI
tomography, and image classification. In particular, DeepTensor offers a 6dB
signal-to-noise ratio improvement over standard denoising methods for signals
corrupted by Poisson noise and learns to decompose 3D tensors 60 times faster
than a single DN equipped with 3D convolutions.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A new data-driven method for operator learning of stochastic differential
equations(SDE) is proposed in this paper. The central goal is to solve forward
and inverse stochastic problems more effectively using limited data. Deep
operator network(DeepONet) has been proposed recently for operator learning.
Compared to other neural networks to learn functions, it aims at the problem of
learning nonlinear operators. However, it can be challenging by using the
original model to learn nonlinear operators for high-dimensional stochastic
problems. We propose a new multi-resolution autoencoder DeepONet model referred
to as MultiAuto-DeepONet to deal with this difficulty with the aid of
convolutional autoencoder. The encoder part of the network is designed to
reduce the dimensionality as well as discover the hidden features of
high-dimensional stochastic inputs. The decoder is designed to have a special
structure, i.e. in the form of DeepONet. The first DeepONet in decoder is
designed to reconstruct the input function involving randomness while the
second one is used to approximate the solution of desired equations. Those two
DeepONets has a common branch net and two independent trunk nets. This
architecture enables us to deal with multi-resolution inputs naturally. By
adding $L_1$ regularization to our network, we found the outputs from the
branch net and two trunk nets all have sparse structures. This reduces the
number of trainable parameters in the neural network thus making the model more
efficient. Finally, we conduct several numerical experiments to illustrate the
effectiveness of our proposed MultiAuto-DeepONet model with uncertainty
quantification.]]></summary>

statistical learning algorithms primarily because they yield unbiased or nearly
unbiased estimators for the parameters in the model. Nonconvex penalties
existing in the literature such as SCAD, MCP, Laplace and arctan have a
singularity at origin which makes them useful also for variable selection.
However, in several high-dimensional frameworks such as deep learning, variable
selection is less of a concern. In this paper, we present a nonconvex penalty
which is smooth at origin. The paper includes asymptotic results for ordinary
least squares estimators regularized with the new penalty function, showing
asymptotic bias that vanishes exponentially fast. We also conducted an
empirical study employing deep neural network architecture on three datasets
and convolutional neural network on four datasets. The empirical study showed
better performance for the new regularization approach in five out of the seven
datasets.]]></summary>

on evaluation is based on the idea of statistical model criticism, popular in
Bayesian data analysis, whereby a statistical model is evaluated in terms of
its ability to reproduce statistics of an unknown data generating process from
which we can obtain samples. A VAE learns not one, but two joint distributions
over a shared sample space, each exploiting a choice of factorisation that
makes sampling tractable in one of two directions (latent-to-data,
data-to-latent). We evaluate samples from these distributions, assessing their
(marginal) fit to the observed data and our choice of prior, and we also
evaluate samples through a pipeline that connects the two distributions
starting from a data sample, assessing whether together they exploit and reveal
latent factors of variation that are useful to a practitioner. We show that
this methodology offers possibilities for model selection qualitatively beyond
intrinsic evaluation metrics and at a finer granularity than commonly used
statistics can offer.]]></summary>

and the recently proposed notion of Distributional Generalization (DG).
Applying this connection, we introduce new conceptual tools for designing
deep-learning methods that bypass "pathologies" of standard stochastic gradient
descent (SGD). First, we prove that differentially private methods satisfy a
"What You See Is What You Get (WYSIWYG)" generalization guarantee: whatever a
model does on its train data is almost exactly what it will do at test time.
This guarantee is formally captured by distributional generalization. WYSIWYG
enables principled algorithm design in deep learning by reducing
$\textit{generalization}$ concerns to $\textit{optimization}$ ones: in order to
mitigate unwanted behavior at test time, it is provably sufficient to mitigate
this behavior on the train data. This is notably false for standard (non-DP)
methods, hence this observation has applications even when privacy is not
required. For example, importance sampling is known to fail for standard SGD,
but we show that it has exactly the intended effect for DP-trained models.
Thus, with DP-SGD, unlike with SGD, we can influence test-time behavior by
making principled train-time interventions. We use these insights to construct
simple algorithms which match or outperform SOTA in several distributional
robustness applications, and to significantly improve the privacy vs. disparate
impact trade-off of DP-SGD. Finally, we also improve on known theoretical
bounds relating differential privacy, stability, and distributional
generalization.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Although evaluation of the expectations on the Ising model is essential in
various applications, this is frequently infeasible because of intractable
multiple summations (or integrations). Spatial Monte Carlo integration (SMCI)
is a sampling-based approximation, and can provide high-accuracy estimations
for such intractable expectations. To evaluate the expectation of a function of
variables in a specific region (called target region), SMCI considers a larger
region containing the target region (called sum region). In SMCI, the multiple
summation for the variables in the sum region is precisely executed, and that
in the outer region is evaluated by the sampling approximation such as the
standard Monte Carlo integration. It is guaranteed that the accuracy of the
SMCI estimator is monotonically improved as the size of the sum region
increases. However, a haphazard expansion of the sum region could cause a
combinatorial explosion. Therefore, we hope to improve the accuracy without
such region expansion. In this study, based on the theory of generalized least
squares, a new effective method is proposed by combining multiple SMCI
estimators. The validity of the proposed method is demonstrated theoretically
and numerically. The results indicate that the proposed method can be effective
in the inverse Ising problem (or Boltzmann machine learning).]]></summary>

 Abstract: " Large foundation models can exhibit unique capabilities depending on the domain of data they are trained on. While these domains are generic, they may only barely overlap. For example, visual-language models (VLMs) are trained on Internet-scale image captions, but large language models (LMs) are further trained on Internet-scale text with no images (e.g. from spreadsheets, to SAT questions). As a result, these models store different forms of commonsense knowledge across different domains. In this work, we show that this model diversity is symbiotic, and can be leveraged to build AI systems with structured Socratic dialogue -- in whi…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have two years of time-series data taken from two sensors which I have split into 80/10/10 non-overlapping train/val/test splits. The task is to denoise one sensor data into another and I am handling it as a regression problem.
 I am following this website and considered an already published model (5 convolutional and 1 fully connected layer) which is trained on a similar dataset and same task.
 For the sake of sanity check, as per the website, I have trained the model on a subset of trainset (3 months) and tried to overfit it (while evaluating on complete val set), which works fine.
 However, I am not sure what to do next from this point on? Shall I just train on the complete trainset now? Or do I increase the layers or play with other hyper params to find more details about my regression problem/data? I would really appreciate your comments. Thank you.
 PS. The target value is sparse i.e. more than 85% of the time it is zero.

Then you could export the video and such. You could also very extensively edit human faces and change small features on a scale from 1-100. The features where incredibly specific like brow bone and nasal bridge.
 If anyone has the website I would appreciate it!!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm keen to hear from people who have made the transition from ML Research/Engineering positions to software engineering roles (or who are considering it). What were your reasons for doing it and did you regret it? I see so many articles about transition from software to ML but none about going the opposite direction.
 Context: I've been working as an ML Engineer for a little over a year, and I'm just... not enjoying it. I want to love my job so badly as I like my boss, my colleagues, and the company (and I'm paid quite well for my level), but I just don't. I feel like the type of work I'm doing is not very smart and yet it's extremely draining: I spend so many hours just looking at loss curves, tweaking features and parameters. I'm somehow bored and stressed at the same time, because I don't enjoy the work and yet I feel the pressure to produce good models, and when they don't work as expected I can't help but take it personally as if if I just tried hard enough they would work. I find that the days were I end up having to take care of more purely engineering tasks I just have a lot more fun and I finish the day more satisfied and less drained. I think I just want to build something instead of spending hours banging my head against shit data. I would love to hear from people who feel or have felt the same way because whenever I speak about this with friends who are in ML they look at me like I'm a lunatic for wanting to leave it for software engineering.
 I'm obviously aware that swe roles are not all fun and games, but I just feel like there's been an excessive push for so many people to move to ML as it's "cool" and "smart" when in reality they're just different things who are going to suit different people.

Matrix factorization is one of the oldest, yet still widely used, techniques for learning how to recommend items such as songs or movies from user ratings. In its basic form, it approximates a large, sparse (i.e., mostly empty) matrix of user-item interactions with a product of two smaller, denser matrices representing learned item and user features. These dense matrices, in turn, can be used to recommend items to a user with which they haven't interacted before. 
Despite its algorithmic simplicity, matrix factorization can still achieve competitive performance in recommender benchmarks. Alternating least squares (ALS), and especially its implicit variation, is a fundamental algorithm to learn the parameters of matrix factorization…]]></summary>

 If the format supports 3D annotation types that is even better. Thanks for your insights in advance.

 DPR was one of the first papers that discussed building dense retrievers using QA pairs only and didn't require a big pretraining computational setup like ORQA or REALM. It is currently used in a lot of places as a dense retriever. You can find Hugginface and Haystack implementations also.
 This video is part of a series on Open-QA using dense retrievers. We have made 2 videos on DPR. In the latter, we discuss how to build a dense retriever from scratch. Thanks for the support and it would be great if you could give any feedback.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am working on a project in which a robots learns its motion. for example Bipedal robot learns to walk on a straight line by learning to adjust the torque and angular velocity of each joint. However, the robot I am working on has complex architecture. It has 10 joints instead of 2, most importantly all of these joints work simultaneously and coherently to produce a desired motion.
 The Problem I am facing is that, the robot has ten joints and each joint can move between -450 to +450
 for simplicity let me define State and Actions of the system
 State = -450 to +450 -------------> normalization ------------------> -10 to 10
 Actions = choose an angle between -10 to 10 for each joint 
 Total Action space for each State at each time step = 10 (no of joints each can move between -10 to 10 at each time step) * 360 (total time steps for a single motion) = 3600 (Output: No of angles required to generate a motion)
 I am using TD3 to solve this conundrum. The Action space is too large how can I reduce the action space?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am currently sitting at a difficult machine-learning problem that I have found no literature on how to solve it. 
 I am given n datapoints x_1,...,x_n that are ordered according to a ranking preference rank(x_1)<rank(x_2)<...<rank(x_n). I am assuming there exists a function f, such, that f(x_i)<f(x_i+1). I am now searching a Bayesian non-parametric model that gives the posterior probability of functions f that abide f(x_i)<f(x_i+1), so that i can estimate the relative rank preferences at new points.
 I have tried out a few things. The naive approach is using a GP prior on f. Unfortunately, computing the posterior distribution p(f(x_1), ... f(x_n)| f(x_1)<...<f(x_n)) has no closed form solution (it is a normal distribution with N linear constraints, which is absolutely terrible to sample from). This makes computing conditional distributions for predictions very challenging. 
 I am currently approximating the solution by using a GP regression model with label y_i = rank(x_i)=i. But this is systematically under-estimating the shape-variation, due to the fact that it adds the assumption that function values between ranks are equidistant. 
 Is there any known approach how to do this?

 We present results on video generation using diffusion models. We propose an architecture for video diffusion models which is a natural extension of the standard image architecture. We show that this architecture is effective for jointly training from image and video data. To generate long and higher resolution videos we introduce a new conditioning technique that performs better than previously proposed methods. We present results on text-conditioned video generation and state-of-the-art results on an unconditional video generation benchmark.

 The most common diagnostic imaging test conducted in emergency rooms is chest radiography. Providing automated preliminary read helpers to physicians might speed up surgery, enhance accuracy, and lower healthcare costs.
 An artificial intelligence tool that interprets chest X-rays without the intervention of a radiologist received regulatory approval in the European Union this week, marking a first for a wholly autonomous medical imaging AI, according to ‘Oxipit‘, the developer of this tool. It’s a watershed moment for AI, and it’s more than likely to spark debate, given that radiologists have spent the last few years working to fully automate parts of their jobs.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am doing a project and there is a problem with dynamic action space
 A complete action space can be divided into four parts. In each state, the action to be selected is one of them
 For example, the total discrete action space length is 1000, which can be divided into four parts, [0:300], [301:500],[501:900],[901:1000]
 For state 1, action_ space is [0:300], State2, action_ space is [301:500], etc
 For this idea, I have several ideas at present:
  
There is no restriction at all. The legal actions of all States are [1:1000], but it may take longer train time and there is not much innovation
 Soft constraint, for example, if state1 selects an illegal action, such as one action in [251: 500], reward gives a negative value, but it is also not innovative
 Hard constraint, use action space mask in each state, but I don't know how to do it.. Is there any relevant article？
 It is directly divided into four action spaces and uses multi-agent cooperative relationship learning
  
​
 Any suggestions？
 thanks！

 [1912.04321] Learning to Code: Coded Caching via Deep Reinforcement Learning (arxiv.org)
 In short, we are trying to achieve the minimum number of transmission of bits from the server to all users
 Now, after 500 episodes of training the number of transmissions does decrease. But when I implement the same actor critic algorithm this does not happen. In fact, the results seem to be completely random. 
 Here is the plot of the same :

 Although my training parameters are slightly different, I can't understand why this would happen.
 I used the parameters and pseudo code from this paper: A Deep Reinforcement Learning Approach for Shared Caching | IEEE Conference Publication | IEEE Xplore - which is an extension of the link at the top.

Is this an okay way of doing feature selection is there another way that gives better results. I tried PCA and LDA and Pearson Correlation method as well in Python and that didn't seem to help or is this the best I could do. Thanks!

Recent years have seen a tremendous increase in the creation and serving of video content to users across the world in a variety of languages and over numerous platforms. The process of creating high quality content can include several stages from video capturing and captioning to  video and audio editing. In some cases dialogue is re-recorded (referred to as dialog replacement, post-sync or dubbing) in a studio in order to achieve high quality and replace original audio that might have been recorded in noisy conditions. However, the dialog replacement process can be difficult and tedious because the newly recorded audio needs to be well synced with the video, requiring …]]></summary>

 We have recently published the code for our AISTATS 2022 paper -
 Sampling in Dirichlet Process Mixture Models for Clustering Streaming Data
 ​
 Video Segmentation Example
 In our work, we have proposed a solution for clustering streaming data. Unlike 'standard' clustering scenarios, in the streaming case the data stream is possibly infinite, you cannot backtrack to previously processed points, and the data statistics are dynamic and change over time.
 Our solution is based on the Dirichlet Process Mixture Model (DPMM), can work with different types of observations, and is very fast, outperforming other methods both in the quality of the results and the speed with which it achieves them.
 It can even be distributed across several processes and/or machines!

 When it comes to health care, especially for life and death situations AI has made things very easy for us. However, it is still expected to drastically change the way medicine is practised. It will also replace the surgeries done by the doctors with the surgeries done using Artificial intelligence, making diagnosing complex diseases, genetic issues and many other health problems extremely easy in the future.

 We have released the preprint and google colab demo for our paper FaceSigns. FaceSigns embeds a secret bit-string as a semi-fragile watermark in the image pixels. The message is recoverable if benign image operations such as color/contrast adjustment, JPEG compression, Instagram filters are applied. However, the message cannot be decoded if the image is facially tampered (eg. DeepFake manipulation) . This selective fragility allows reliable detection of DeepFake manipulations applied on images signed using FaceSigns. 
 Try out our google colab demo to see message encoding and decoding using FaceSigns!

 I work in house and I’m part of our Google search team. Our ad spend is pretty large (9 figures per year, in USD). We build/manage stuff at scale using SQL, R, Javascript, and so on. So everything is pretty much “big data” in flavour.
 Lately I’ve been more and more interested in data science, and I’m looking to take things to the next level by incorporating machine learning into our workflow. I’d really love to build some useful machine learning models using popular Python libraries such as Pandas, SciKit Learn, NumPy, TensorFlow, PyTorch, and so on.
 Any suggestions on cool, and most importantly useful machine learning models I could build? (By “useful”, I mean something that could help increase the profits.) I think some classification, predictive, or recommender models would be great to start with. Cheers! 😄

Major comments by the reviewers include: more justification on the assumptions, discussion on choices of parameters, and experiments in more complex and different environments. 
 We want to address all the major and minor comments as best as we can but given that the response is limited to one page we cannot explain everything in detail. I am not sure what is the acceptable norm here. Do reviewers expect the authors to conduct some experiments during the rebuttal and provide sample results or just explain what additional experiment we will conduct and how we will do it. Justification and reasoning should be in details or a brief explanation with an assurance to add a detailed discussion in the final version suffices.

 Currently, I am doing some research with the UCI Adult dataset(https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/adult). This first step is to build a high-accuracy classifier model. 
 Does anyone know any high accuracy model on this dataset (more than 90%)? I use many machine learning models like logistic regression and neural network. But no matter how complex the model is, I can only get an accuracy of about 85% on the test set. I tried to google but I found many others also have similar results of about 85%.
 Any posts or papers will be helpful! Thanks in advance for your help!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In the PPO paper it is stated that we have to collect trajectories of length T from N different workers. Suppose I am not using multiple workers then I have to collect episodes N times of fixed length T. But these episode lengths are variable i.e. some episodes end much before T and some much after T. So my question is how do we calculated advantage because according to the PPO paper, for generalized advantage estimate, we have to observe the reward of terminal state. 
 ​
 So how should I calculate GAE in this ?

 I just wanted to share a project I've been working on for the past year - using deep RL to learn to play the board game Settlers of Catan.
 I expect everyone is aware of the results that DeepMind/OpenAI have got recently on Go, DOTA 2, Starcraft 2 etc, but I was motivated to see how much progress could be made with existing RL techniques on a reasonably complex game - but with access to significantly less computational resources.
 Whilst I didn't end up with an agent that performs at a super-human level, there was clear learning progress and the results were quite interesting. I decided to do a full write-up of the project here, which I figured could be useful for anyone else who is interested in trying to apply DRL to a new, complicated environment. I also open-sourced all the code here for anyone interested.
 If anyone has any feedback or any questions at all that'd be great!

 We just submitted to ICML 2022 and got our reviews back. We were excited to see that 4/4 reviews were positive and acknowledged the contribution of the paper. However, there were some minor criticisms (e.g. didn't do good enough lit reviews, could use a few more experiments) across several reviews.
 I was wondering if it is ever acceptable to not submit a rebuttal? Can a rebuttal in this case actually hurt us by rocking the boat---or for ICML is the norm that you should always submit a rebuttal that addresses all the reviewers' criticisms.
 We were wondering what the norm is for ICML specifically?

 Paper (pdf file format). The paper is also linked to in the above blog post.
 Abstract
  
Contrastive models like CLIP have been shown to learn robust representations of images that capture both semantics and style. To leverage these representations for image generation, we propose a two-stage model: a prior that generates a CLIP image embedding given a text caption, and a decoder that generates an image conditioned on the image embedding. We show that explicitly generating image representations improves image diversity with minimal loss in photorealism and caption similarity. Our decoders conditioned on image representations can also produce variations of an image that preserve both its semantics and style, while varying the non-essential details absent from the image representation. We use diffusion models for the decoder and experiment with both autoregressive and diffusion models for the prior, finding that the latter are computationally more efficient and produce higher-quality samples.

Hopefully this summer, we’ll do a product launch and people will be able to use it for all sorts of things.

Reinforcement learning (RL) can be used to train a policy to perform a task via trial and error, but a major challenge in RL is learning policies from scratch in environments with hard exploration challenges. For example, consider the setting depicted in the door-binary-v0 environment from the adroit manipulation suite, where an RL agent must control a hand in 3D space to open a door placed in front of it. 
   


An RL agent must control a hand in 3D space to open a door placed in front of it. The agent receives a reward signal only when the door is completely open.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm curious about wether this unusual learning trajectory observed in humans has also been observed in artificial neural nets. A well known phenomenon in the 'dark souls' video game series is that ones first attempt at a boss is often much better than subsequent attempts. Boss hp at time of death by attempt might go something like: 35%, 55%, 85%, 87%, 75%, 54%, , 60%, 43%, 27%, 38%, 12%, 0%. This sounds very anecdotal, but its know to the community of these games to be a real thing. See this thread for evidence. Have NN playing games been known to exhibit a similar pattern, with peak in success early on, followed by a step descent , then a slow gradual climb? Or is this a purely human phenomenon?
 My hypothesis as to why this happens is that over the course of the first couple attempts, the player learns a bunch of bad strategies which must be slowly unlearned, whereas on attempt one, the player has no defined strategies good or bad.

 abstract: "The Bayesian additive regression trees (BART) model is an ensemble method extensively and successfully used in regression tasks due to its consistently strong predictive performance and its ability to quantify uncertainty. BART combines "weak" tree models through a set of shrinkage priors, whereby each tree explains a small portion of the variability in the data. However, the lack of smoothness and the absence of a covariance structure over the observations in standard BART can yield poor performance in cases where such assumptions would be necessary. We propose Gaussian processes Bayesian additive regression trees (GP-BART) as an extension of BART which assumes Gaussian process (GP) priors for the predictions of each terminal node among all trees. We illustrate our model on simulated and real data and compare its performance to traditional modelling approaches, outperforming them in many scenarios. An implementation of our method is available in the \textsf{R} package \texttt{rGPBART} available at: https://github.com/MateusMaiaDS/gpbart."

 I am relatively new in the area of machine learning/reinforcement learning. I have this basic question regarding practical implementations. I just want to know, what does it look like the output of a reinforcement learning agent/algorithm in practice? Is it like a 'look-up table' that will set the weights/parameters of the ML model based on the input data? 
 Note that I am asking after the offline training of the agent. How to implement the trained agent in practice, like in an embedded system? Do you guys have references or clues to help me to clarify?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello!
 I am using SAC(Soft Actor-Critic) to complete a reinforcement learning task with only four steps, each action is from one of four different action spaces. These four action spaces are essentially the same, and they are all chemical compound. I just want the agent to take different types of compounds at each step.
 I have the following questions：
  
Whether the different four steps can be trained? In fact, there is a paper that only has four steps in a reinforcement learning process, but his action space only has one discrete action space.
 Is there any article I can learn from? because I know that for the handle control of the game, there are usually multiple discrete action spaces, but each discrete space dimension of my task is larger, such as [800, 700, 500, 600]

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As a project in the course of my PhD, I had to create a prototype for a project. My PhD is application of machine learning in health care. The project definition and scope was faaaar too wide. However, I managed to create a working demo which encompasses some use cases of the project. At best, it can be called a framework, where I have put in different DL components and it works okay for those use cases only. Most of the components, I have used are pre-trained language models (maybe fine tuned them to my use case). However, there is no active training or learning involved. This is because I created this for a demo only. I also created a very small dataset and tested the framework over the dataset and the results were ok. However, my supervisor now wants me to write a paper, as he is confident, that the use case is rather unique and my working framework is a good first step. I believe, his aim is to get me started on the paper writing process, which I appreciate. However, I am not confident about it at all.
 My question is, can a 'framework' composed of pre-trained models with the end goal of solving a problem in health care is good enough? Are there precedents of any such paper? And if I trust my supervisor's instincts, are there any fancy ways to frame the framework so that it does not look so basic?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[At my company we use RL to solve our problem. The thing is : our problem is rather complex, and this is the core of our product (so clients rely on the results produced). 
 In order to reach satisfying results despite an agent that doesn't learn very well, we use sampling at inference time : instead of taking the best trajectory according to the agent, we take X trajectories and keep only the one with the best reward.
 This seems completely fine at first (similar things are done in NLP for example, with beam search), but in our case the sampling size is huge : 1024. Usually when using beam search, we use maybe a beam size of 6. Maybe 10 if you have good hardware ?
 ​
 Now, the agent seems to be learning : the mean return is slightly increasing over time, the entropies for the actions are steadily decreasing, etc...
 Now the goal of the ML team is to improve agent's learning to decrease the sampling size at inference time (because it's costly to run 1024 trajectories through the environment...).
 But whatever we try, the improvements are not reflected (we compare all our experiments with 1024 sampling in order to see what the customers will see).
 ​
 IMO this is because our sampling size is way too huge, even a random agent can produce okay-ish results...
 Is my intuition the right one ?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’ll give an example to better explain my question (don’t get hung up on the numbers, it’s all made up). Say you are using a tree based model trying to project how many points a player will score in a given basketball game.
 Most players shoot free throws at a slightly lower percentage on the road, than they do at home. However, the magnitude varies player to player. Let’s assume for 95% of players with significant data, the ratio of home free throw percentage to away is 1 to 1.15. Generally speaking, older players are closer to 1 and younger players are around 1.1 (since older players get used to the opposing crowd).
 Now also say it takes 100 home and 100 away free throws to get a stable reliable ratio.
 Now say a young player only has 50 home, and 50 away free throws. With this amount of data he has a ratio of 1, however the sample size is not enough to be fully stable.
 Which would be better…
 5 features into this model, his home away ratio, average ratio for players his age, home free throw count, and away free throw attempts.
 1 feature. His ‘projected’ home away ratio, which is a weighted average of his ratio with the average for plaeyrs his age. Since he’s 50% of the way to significance, 0.5 * 1 + 0.5 * 1.1 = 1.05
 The benefit of the of the first choice is that it may find other interactions that I never conceived of, however, it could incorporate noise. Is there a general consensus, or is this just a try both and see what works?

 It has PPO agents in MARL, all of them with multihead attention performed on the observation, in such a way that an attention map is created for each agent. This attention map has information about how strongly each agent is attending to various elements of the environment. With KL divergence, the agents are rewarded for minimizing the difference between their attention maps.

 Meta-Learning Machines in a Single Lifelong Trial: lecture video (24 min) presented at meta-learning workshops at ICML 2020 and NeurIPS 2021. URL of talk: https://youtu.be/2GgGVdkq2bU
 Abstract
 The most widely used machine learning algorithms were designed by humans and thus are hindered by our cognitive biases and limitations. Can we also construct meta-learning algorithms that can learn better learning algorithms so that our self-improving AIs have no limits other than those inherited from computability and physics? This question has been a main driver of my research since I wrote a thesis on it in 1987. In the past decade, it has become a driver of many other people's research as well. Here I summarize our work starting in 1994 on meta-reinforcement learning with self-modifying policies in a single lifelong trial, and - since 2003 - mathematically optimal meta-learning through the self-referential Gödel Machine. This talk was previously presented at meta-learning workshops at ICML 2020 and NeurIPS 2021. Many additional publications on meta-learning can be found at https://people.idsia.ch/~juergen/metalearning.html

 I've been working for the last 5 years as Data Scientist. During this time I have tried dozens of times to improve my models via hyperparameter tuning, but I've never got improvements from there. I've tried all the possible approaches: grid search, random search, bayesian search, etc. But in no case did I get satisfactory results.
 Does this happen to anyone else? Have you ever got robust improvements via HP tuning?

Allen Institute researchers propose MERLOT Reserve, a model that learns to represent videos over time and across several modalities, including audio, subtitles, and video frames. It was trained using a new learning objective and more than 20 million YouTube videos.
 MERLOT Reserve is a unique, cutting-edge methodology for solving video-related inquiries. MERLOT Reserve can dependably choose the correct answer from a selection of multiple-choice answers when given a video and a question. This forecast is made by MERLOT Reserve jointly reasoning over the visual frames of the video, the video subtitles, and the audio in the movie.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi! I'm a first-year Grad Student in Computer Vision and I am trying to get caught up on the latest research in my field. It seems like everyone in CS has heard about all of the latest papers but I just have no idea how. My knowledge is limited to general ideas and doesn't know any specific papers unless they have like 20000+ citations.
 So my question is: how do you hear about these papers and get caught up? Is there a reference somewhere that puts together a list of all the "must-read" papers that have come out? I feel like I am already 5 years behind in my knowledge. It would be great if there was something like "Top 5 papers of the week" that I could read to stay on top of things.
 Also, this doesn't just apply to Vision. I would like to have an idea of the other major developments in other fields (like NLP, general ML/DL, etc.) since I think that can carry over to my field.
 Thanks! Looking forward to your replies

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Based on my experiences in both academia and industry, I see that many researchers get listed as authors on papers solely for having attended the relevant project meetings, despite not contributing anything substantial to the work. I know of several people who've gotten on dozens of papers this way, despite not being able to explain the main details behind many of the papers they "co-authored." Of course, they can then claim credit for the work publicly as well as have their academic profile benefit from the citations accrued by the work.
 I've noticed that typically, these people are initially invited onto the project because they are on chummy terms with someone on the project. Concerningly, the more someone successfully "paper-rides" this way, the stronger their publication record looks, which makes it easier for them to find their way onto more projects to paper ride in the future.
 It seems that the obsessive focus on paper counts and citations has encouraged the rise of intellectually dishonest strategies for maximizing one's academic footprint. The huge research scientist salaries at top industry labs, which similarly obsess over paper counts and citations in their hiring process, only amplifies the incentive for paper riding.
 The reason I think it is bad: As more people paper ride, co-authorship on a paper gradually becomes a worse indication of expertise. Not to mention, paper riders are intellectually dishonest, by claiming credit for research that they didn't significantly contribute to. In a sense, it seems like a roundabout form of plagiarism.
 I know some might disagree with this take, as some people believe in being as generous about co-authorship as possible. I find that mindset to create the perfect environment for paper riders to flourish. I'm wondering if you've also seen paper riding happen and whether you think this behavior is good or bad.

Ever queried a recommender system and found that the same search only a few moments later or on a different device yields very different results? This is not uncommon and can be frustrating if a person is looking for something specific. As a designer of such a system, it is also not uncommon for the metrics measured to change from design and testing to deployment, bringing into question the utility of the experimental testing phase. Some level of such irreproducibility can be expected as the world changes and new models are deployed. However, this also happens regularly as requests hit duplicates of the same model or models are being refreshed.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all. I've been stuck on this problem for a while and I thought I might be able to find some help here. Any kind of assistance would be greatly appreciated. 
 My setup is as follows. I have an environment with 3 agents. All 3 agents have a single policy network, and it is based on CommNet. My goal is to implement a replay buffer for this environment. I verified that my replay buffer logic is good. I tried running 3 different types of runs:
  
Normal on-policy run: The agents perform an episode, and at the end of each episode the data (such as the states, actions, etc) from this episode are used to calculate the loss
 Using just the last episode from the replay buffer: The agents perform an episode, and the data is stored in the replay buffer. At the end of each episode, the last episode is sampled from the replay buffer (which is the episode that was just performed). This is just to confirm that my replay buffer is working properly, and the reward curve for this case matches that from (1).
 Using 1 random episode from the replay buffer: The agents perform an episode, and the data is stored in the replay buffer. At the end of each episode, a random episode is sampled from the replay buffer and used to calculate the loss. The performance is terrible in this case, and the environment times out each time
  
For some reason, as soon as I turn on random sampling, progress is really bad. I'm sorry to pose such an open-ended question, but what are some things I could check to pinpoint the source of this problem? What could be a reason as to why performance is as expected when just sampling the last episode, whereas it is terrible when randomly sampling episodes? I've tried some things thus far but nothing has worked, and I turned to this community in hopes of getting some help. I'm new to the area of reinforcement learning, so I would be very grateful for any kind of help you can offer. Thanks in advance

 However, the script outputs 4 parameter values and the best fit is actually a Exponentiated Weibull distribution.
 Now I am clueless how to generate a sample list of data of n-size. I know for sure about the normal distribution after getting these params as mean and sigma. How to I generate such list. Please help.

 However, what I have seen is that the embedding space doesn't cluster the images as well as some contrastive methods. However contrastive methods require non-elegant negative sampling etc. 
 Can we somehow force the VAE to learn both the variational lower bound as well as learn a good metric between samples such as visually similar samples are better clustered together?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Some time down the road, when AutoML becomes more established, it can help us determine the best ML model and hyperparameters for a particular problem. This will not replace data scientist, as we still need data scientists for their domain knowledge, which is critical for scoping business problems, pre-processing data, and deriving business insights from the trained model. However, since data scientists no longer need to deal with the technicalities of a model in the near future (i.e. they no longer have to tune hyperparameters, determine the best opitmistion function etc), is there still a need for aspiring data scientists to learn about the intricacies and nuances behind the various models (maybe by coding the model from scratch)? Or is it enough for them to learn how to operate an AutoML system? (My question is referring to the corporate world in general and not to academia) Thanks in advance for your answers :)

 We've just launched a competition at the AutoML-Conf 2022, the DAC4AutoML competition. It has two tracks, one for configuring a Computer Vision model and one for a RL pipeline: https://automl.github.io/dac4automlcomp/ 
 And what is DAC exactly? It means we want to find well-performing hyperparameter configurations like in Algorithm Configuration, but we do it dynamically - thus DAC, Dynamic Algorithm Configuration. As to how that is supposed to happen? We don't put any restrictions on the solutions for the competitions, so you can submit your hand-tuned static hyperparameter setting if you want. Or you can use some sort of heuristic, a regression model, reinforcement learning, ... whatever works. 
 If you're interested in participating, you can submit from now on until the 18.06. AOE, the winners will be announced at the AutoML-Conf.

 Output from using model.learn(env) on both Envs
 On the left I have a simple dummy CustomEnv (Using Stable-Baselines3 with Gym) for testing, and on the right I have my actual CustomEnv that I am working on in a project.
 As you can see, the dummy environment gives me the rollout monitoring, whereas there is no rollout monitoring for the actual environment (just time + train statistics/monitoring). 
 I am using very similar code when setting up the training of the model, however the complexity of the actual model is significantly higher than the dummy. In theory, the complexity of the environment shouldnt make a big difference to the monitoring right? All of the key parts are still there (reward function, step function, reset function etc.).
 In both cases it says that the environments are being wrapped by the 'Moniter' wrapper so that cant be it.
 Does anyone know why this might be happening?

 That may be about to change with the rollout release of Stylegan-XL weights trained on Imagenet. This notebook (https://github.com/CasualGANPapers/StyleGANXL-CLIP) has had nice results with objects never seen by the model, such as "apple" and "ant", as well as scenes such as "judo athletes fighting"

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, all. I got accepted into my top choice of college as an undecided major. Recently, I have decided to pursue artificial intelligence! Unfortunately, it is near impossible to transfer into computer science at my particular university. I was wondering if I can still pursue AI as a career if I complete one of the following majors:
 -Mathematics
 -Information or Data Science
 -Statistics
 -Linguistics
 Additionally, I could pursue one of these and minor in another. I should be able to minor in computer science as well if necessary. Hopefully, my choice of major would allow me to pursue research or an internship in artificial intelligence. I am willing to take additional summer courses and pursue relevant certifications to ensure that I am up to par with my computer science colleagues.

 In that thread, OP asked why support vector machines are still taught. People offered several thoughts: they're easier to think about, they're still perfectly good for some real-world problems, and for some problems they apparently rival deep networks.
 I did a project for a class around six years ago using an SVM as implemented in scikit-learn. I was pretty satisfied with the project, but I also experienced some frustrations, and came away with some questions. I started working with Tensorflow and DNNs in earnest soon after finishing that project, and I largely stopped thinking about SVM. I would like to revive the questions I asked, but never answered, here.
  
A DNN with multiple outputs can potentially use a single neuron in the prediction of more than one output. For multiple, mutually-exclusive categories, this makes good sense. An SVM with multiple outputs in scikit-learn was implemented as pairs of one-vs-one SVMs, each of which was independently fit to data. This gets inefficient quickly. Has this changed? Can it be changed?
 DNN training at scale is a problem that many people have worked hard to make practical. Even non-experts like myself use our home GPUs to accelerate training of DNNs on large data sets. In scikit-learn, SVM training was implemented in a single thread on one CPU core. If you are performing cross-validation or a hyperparameter optimization study, it might be practical to parallelize fitting; one thread for each distinct condition. But can you parallelize the SVM fitting algorithm for a single condition? I went looking for software, but I couldn't find anything.
  
Over to you folks. Cheers.

 I am interested in knowing whether hyperparameters such as dropout, or recurrent dropout, batchnorm, etc etc, are even necessary in the usage of seq2seq model, but couldn’t find anything on it for weeks.
 In the case, let’s say, using gridsearchCV, what hyperparameters do you tweak for ur seq2seq model? (Other than the usual stuff like number of neurons, etc). There is absolutely zero information for that on seq2seq model, and everyone just assumes that putting an attention mechanism solves everything without hyperparameters tunings. I have also looked up on codes on seq2seq, and no hyperparameters tunings were shown whatsoever. 
 FYI, this is in the context of time series data, using seq2seq, if that matters.

I see many implementations scale the running cumulative discounted reward in a certain way. However, each of them does it in a different way. let R be the running cumulative discounted reward, which is considered the best? Or is there a source of the method to use? implementations I saw from different places include: 
  
 directly use R to calculate the advantage and training value network (most PPO tutorials use this)
 use (R / std(R)), where std is the mini-batch standard deviation
 use (R / std(R)), where std is the running standard deviation
 use ((R - mean(R)) / std(R)), where both mean and std are mini-batch wise
 use ((R - mean(R)) / std(R)), where both mean and std are running stats.
 do the above and clip to a certain range ([-10, 10] or [-1, 1])
  
 I also see several different ways for the value network, let V be the output of the value network:
  
 output raw logit, without any scaling/output activation (most PPO tutorials use this)
 output raw logit, but use the same scaling as discussed above for running cumulative discounted reward, for example, if return value is (R / std(R)), value output will be (V / std(R))
 do the same as 2, but use the stat of V instead of R for scaling, for example, if the return value is (R / std(R)), the value output will be (V / std(V))
 output with tanh activation at the last layer
 output with tanh activation at the last layer, and multiply by a constant to match the range of the return

 This paper finds what seems to be a new phenomenon when working in the continual learning/life-long learning domain. If new tasks are continually introduced to an agent, it seems to loose it's ability to learn the more time progresses. Intuitively it's similar to this idea that "an old dog can't learn new tricks". They propose a fairly simple method of overcoming this limitation that involves resetting weights that are not contributing much to the outcome of the network. They call the method Continual Backprop.

 As the title describes, I’ll be making my first model as part of my final project. I still have a pretty high-level understanding of everything, so forgive any inaccuracies as I describe what I’m going for.
 The problem I’m attempting to solve is known as the traveling salesman problem. Essentially, a route needs to be formulated that stops at n given locations. Finding the most efficient route with many stops algorithmically is impractical because the number of possible routes increases exponentially with each added location. 
 The environment will simulate travel on city roads. Speed will be a constant, set to whatever the roads speed limit is. I am using .pbf format vector GIS data from OSM so that the environment consists of real-world pathways. I’m using GeoPandas and Pyrosm to work with the data, and I’m collecting nodes for the location of gas stations so that the environment can simulate needing to fuel the vehicle. Gas price will be a constant, as well as vehicle fuel-efficiency.
 Scoring will be based on the calculated time it would take to complete a route and the calculated cost (in gas). The goal will be to find the most efficient route to take when n = some large number. 
 I’ve never worked with spatial data either, so I’m not sure what kind of challenges that poses. I worry that adding nodes for the locations of gas stations might be difficult. I’m also wondering if I’m better off using Tensorflow and Keras for this, but I’m not really aware of all the technical considerations I should be making before deciding on that.
 Do you have any tips that might help me out? Solutions to problems I haven’t hit just yet, but likely will? 
 Thanks for your help!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As far as I am aware, StableBaselines3 is the gold standard for reliable implementations of most popular / SOTA deep RL methods. However working with them in the past, I don't find them to be the most usable when looking for extensibility (making changes to the provided implementations) due to how the code base is structured in the behind the scenes (inheritance, lots of helper methods & utilities, etc.).
 For example, if I wish to change some portion of a method's training update with SB3 it would probably involve overloading a class method before initialization, making sure al the untouched portions of the original method are carried over, etc.
 Could anyone point me in the direction of any implementations that are more workable from the perspective of extensibility? Ideally implementations that are largely self contained to a single class / file, aren't heavily abstracted aware across multiple interfaces, don't rely heavily on utility functions, etc.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Given a NN class, is there something specific we need to care of when converting *args and **kwargs to a canonical kwarg representation? I ask this because in this code from Google (https://github.com/google-research/google-research/blob/c56b47713b08c95ad427d5f93ee0dbb9ad008964/social_rl/multiagent_tfagents/joint_attention/attention_networks.py#L557) they use a TFDecorator-aware replacement for inspect.getcallargs, instead of using getcallargs directly. So my questions are: 
 - Is it possible to use inspect.getcallargs to convert *args and **kwargs to a canonical kwarg representation?
 - If no, is there an equivalent in PyTorch? I couldn't find any, so I was wondering how people go about that.

 - AFAIK from the Blogpost, Scaling laws still hold up (i.e not yet plateaued)
 - New transfer learning capabilities, outperforms fine-tuned models with 50x less data (Codex-12B)
 - The interesting part is how it meta-learns techy geeky jokes and is able to correlate concepts, and explain jokes suggesting starting doing a bit more meta-learning than GPT3 ever could.... But still not enough to generate decent ones (though the joke wasn't particularly humorous, so I may be underestimating)
 SoTA on various tasks, chain-of-thought-reasoning still holds up to scaling and outperforms some reasoning benchmarks, BIG-bench sees a huge improvement and general LLM thingys :)

Every developer in the world might benefit from these automated models, which have the potential to increase productivity. However, because the models may fail to understand program semantics, the quality of the generated code cannot be guaranteed.
 Microsoft researchers introduce Jigsaw, a new tool that can help these big language models perform better. Jigsaw is a Python Pandas API code generator that accepts multi-modal inputs. Jigsaw uses post-processing techniques to decipher the syntax and semantics of programs and then uses user feedback to improve future performance.

In recent years, large neural networks trained for language understanding and generation have achieved impressive results across a wide range of tasks. GPT-3 first showed that large language models (LLMs) can be used for few-shot learning and can achieve impressive results without large-scale task-specific data collection or model parameter updating. More recent LLMs, such as GLaM, LaMDA, Gopher, and Megatron-Turing NLG, achieved state-of-the-art few-shot results on many tasks by scaling model size, using sparsely activated modules, and training on larger datasets from more diverse sources. Yet much work remains in understanding the capabilities that emerge with few-shot learning as we push the limits of …]]></summary>

 ​
 I really love creating music algorithmically, which is why I have dedicated my master’s thesis to the generation of music patterns by the use of artificial intelligence.
 In the course of the past 12 months, I have programmed a deep recurrent neural network in Python, which I have trained on 200 self-made music patterns in order to generate somehow novel motifs.
 ​
 In order to evaluate my model, I have set up a short online listening experiment.
 I’m looking for test subjects right now, so if you are interested in participating, I would really appreciate it.
 The listening experiment will take you just about 5 to 8 minutes to complete and the only thing you need is a pair of headphones.
 You can partake on your computer as well as on your smartphone or tablet.
 ​
 Here is the link which gets you to the listening experiment:

Monte Carlo Simulation
 Computational Learning Theory
  
The year after I will also take a course on Reinforcement Learning, but it has not been created yet. 
 Note: I can also take both if recommended, if I do so, I will take one of the courses before taking the RL course, and the other would be at the same time. 
 Some further thought I've had:
  
CLT includes Bandits, which is surely were useful to know, but it seems to be only a rather small part, and I'm unsure whether all the other topics like PAC Learning and Rademacher Bounds are useful?
 
MC is more practical while CLT is more theoretic (Apparently VERY theoretic according to the course description above). I am not afraid of theoretic courses, but I struggle more with them than more practical courses.
 
The sentiment around the MC course, is that it is pretty good. I don't know anyone who have taken the CLT course.
 
If I choose both, which order would you take them in?

 In recent years reinforcement learning (RL) has received a lot of attention thanks to its performance and ability to address complex tasks. At the same time, multiple recent papers, notably work from OpenAI, have shown that evolution strategies (ES) can be competitive with standard RL algorithms on some problems while being simpler and more scalable. Similar results were obtained by researchers from Uber, this time using a gradient-free genetic algorithm (GA) to train deep neural networks on complex control tasks. Moreover, recent research in the field of evolutionary algorithms (EA) has led to the development of algorithms like Novelty Search and Quality Diversity, capable of…]]></summary>

 Evolutionary Reinforcement Learning workshop at GECCO 2022, July 9-13, Boston, USA
 
 In recent years reinforcement learning (RL) has received a lot of attention thanks to its performance and ability to address complex tasks. At the same time, multiple recent papers, notably work from OpenAI, have shown that evolution strategies (ES) can be competitive with standard RL algorithms on some problems while being simpler and more scalable. Similar results were obtained by researchers from Uber, this time using a gradient-free genetic algorithm (GA) to train deep neural networks on complex control tasks. Moreover, recent research in the field of evolutionary algorithms (EA) has led to the development of algorithms like Novelty Search and Quality Diversity, capable of…]]></summary>

My question is suppose one episode ends much before T. If I run that episode upto lenth T then it will only collect negative rewards in each timestep which in turn makes the training impossible as the return if very big negative number. So what can be done instead of this?
 I might be getting it wrong, so please correct me by commenting.

I need to test a model, based loosely on BERT, that classifies a piece of text as having right or left political ideology leaning and whether it promotes any racial or religious stereotypes.
 For training purpose we used SBIC, IBC, and Stereoset. Though these only contain short sentences which are labeled as belonging to only one of the above categories.
 Is anyone aware of any other Dataset which can be used for this purpose, which hopefully contains text labeled as promoting or containing a political leaning (left/right, conservative/liberal, neutral) and further either any racial or religious stereotypes?
 Very thankful in adv

 Don't know if this is the right subreddit, but here goes....
 I'm looking to voice clone my father. He has passed recently, and despite being difficult for all, it's been especially hard for my mother, married early to him and together for 50 years. Her birthday is coming up, I'd love to be able to create a 5-10 second sound byte of him for her.
 Fortunately, there's likely to be lots of his voice recording around, part of his job was speaking and instructing.
 So, is there any way this is possible, to be done without great difficulty, and produce an accurate result?
 I am understanding the moralities of crafting something with his deceased voice. I thought about it quite a bit. However, I feel that it's for his soulmate who's struggling, who he had no qualms spending his life with and travelling abroad with, spent his last days with. I'm certain he would want to help.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Given that most benchmarks for image classification are based on regular, everyday world objects RGB images (or grayscale), what are some unconventional science cases where 2D inputs are substantially different from what we are used to perceive by eye? 
 For example, I'm interested in cases where spatial information can't be constrained to narrow pixel value ranges, such as exponential signals. Or that any standard normalisation (say min-max, zscore) and normalisation layers are not applicable and could lead to the loss of information.
 One of these cases is Astronomy. However, most practitioners try to to adapt the problem to established standards (say fake RGB images, log scaling flux images, etc). What are other cases out there where the nature of the 2D inputs are very distinct to what we are used to parse through our eyes and what deep nets are benchmarked on? I'm curious about tailored solutions that would intrinsically change the way the deep nets are constructed to solve the research question.

 I'm Atindriyo Sanyal, one of the founders of the ML company Galileo (https://rungalileo.io/). We're building a cool new tool/framework for ML practitioners that helps shine a light on the data you are training your models with.
 I'd love to get some feedback on the product, and since we're still in private beta, I'm looking for folks to try out the product on their datasets and models. It's easy to use and hooks into popular frameworks such as pyTorch, Tensorflow, Keras, SpaCy etc. 
 Caveat: Currently the tool only works for NLP use cases (think text classification, NER etc).
 I'll be giving $100 to folks who are willing to give some time to this and provide feedback on the usability of the product. If you're interested, here's a really tiny form (should take <1 minute to fill) for you to fill out. I'll review the applications and send you an email for a follow up Zoom chat where I'll share the software artifacts with you!
 https://docs.google.com/forms/d/11V20C_J_SyNaX7QL6DasnTe7f0UiueUyaKdmt3xL1oI/edit
 Look forward and happy (machine) learning!

 It’s relatively easy to formulate and use DQN type algorithms by using neural network and say pytorch + stochastic optimization but I want to try out some tree based methods. (at least to reproduce papers which claim to use them)
 But I don’t know 1) If we have to design the structures and learning algorithms by hand or is there any package I can use? 
 2) How should the learning be done? We obviously can’t go regression type learning because of the bootstrapping nature of the Bellman equation?

 My current thoughts are
  
Ease of getting data into the platform
 Ease of getting data off of the platform
 Automation for spinning up and down instances
 Availability of the type of instance you want
 Price too high
 Not enough/too many abstractions

 We have released last week our paper "Efficient-VDVAE: Less is more" with code!
 We present simple modifications to the Very Deep VAE to make it converge up to 2.6x times faster and save up to 20x times memory load. We also introduce a gradient smoothing technique to improve stability during training. Our model achieves comparable or better negative log-likelihood (NLL) on 7 commonly used datasets.
 Additionally, we make an argument against existing 5-bit benchmarks. We empirically show as well that 3% of the latent space is enough to encode the data information without any performance loss. Thus, indicating the potential to efficiently leverage the Hierarchical VAE's latent space in downstream tasks.

 We've just released the code for our paper (accepted to CVPR2022) 
 DeepDPM is a nonparametric deep-clustering method which unlike most deep clustering methods, does not require knowing the number of clusters, K; rather, it infers it as a part of the overall learning. Using a split/merge framework to change the clusters number adaptively and a novel loss, our proposed method outperforms existing (both classical and deep) nonparametric methods.
 While the few existing deep nonparametric methods lack scalability, we show ours by being the first such method that reports its performance on ImageNet.

 According to Salesforce AI Research, conversational AI programming is a new paradigm that brings this vision to life, thanks to an AI system that builds software.
 Introducing CodeGen: Creating Programs from Prompts
 The large-scale language model, CodeGen, which converts simple English prompts into executable code, is the first step toward this objective. The person doesn’t write any code; instead, (s)he describes what (s)he wants the code to perform in normal language, and the computer does the rest.
 Conversational AI refers to technologies that allow a human and a computer to engage naturally through a conversation. Chatbots, voice assistants, and virtual agents are examples of conversational AI.

 I'm wondering if there are some real life scenarios that I could use to create my own personal projects. Otherwise, I'd be fine with games. 
 I want to try all of it out from Dynamic Programming to crazy ass stuff like A3C, PPO and so on. I like RL, more so than any other form of ML, and I want to play around with it as a hobby. 
 This is really the area of ML for me. For starters, there are fundamentals behind it, so you can mostly explain why agents do one thing or another. Additionally, there isn't a need to have massive amounts of data. It's also the only type of ML that I've been able to successfully use with software engineering. 
 Designing the agent and the API it uses to take actions in an environment is as much a software engineering project as is creating a REST API. 
 I feel there is a lot of potential for me to go crazy with this, and I was wondering if people have any cool suggestions. Anything that is real time is anything that I want to do. Real time systems and RL are exactly the sort of thing I love to do.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Confidence regions are the 2D version of a confidence interval. Almost everywhere in the literature, the shape is elliptic, but no justification is provided. You would think that a confidence region of level γ is defined as the domain of minimum area, covering a mass γ of the underlying probability distribution. That sounds perfectly logical, but it is mentioned nowhere. Based on this definition, the boundary of a confidence region is obtained by solving an optimization problem: it is a problem in calculus of variations -- finding a boundary curve encompassing a domain of minimum area. These problems are usually hard to solve, but in this case, the solution seems trivial: it must be a contour line. And if the underlying distribution is Gaussian, contour lines are obviously ellipses. This would be a solid justification as to why ellipses are so widespread.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The sensor to shooter timeline is affected by two main variables: satellite
positioning and asset positioning. Speeding up satellite positioning by adding
more sensors or by decreasing processing time is important only if there is a
prepared shooter, otherwise the main source of time is getting the shooter into
position. However, the intelligence community should work towards the
exploitation of sensors to the highest speed and effectiveness possible.
Achieving a high effectiveness while keeping speed high is a tradeoff that must
be considered in the sensor to shooter timeline. In this paper we investigate
two main ideas, increasing the effectiveness of satellite imagery through image
manipulation and how on-board image manipulation would affect the sensor to
shooter timeline. We cover these ideas in four scenarios: Discrete Event
Simulation of onboard processing versus ground station processing, quality of
information with cloud cover removal, information improvement with super
resolution, and data reduction with image to caption. This paper will show how
image manipulation techniques such as Super Resolution, Cloud Removal, and
Image to Caption will improve the quality of delivered information in addition
to showing how those processes effect the sensor to shooter timeline.]]></summary>

 What is amazing is its speed and memory efficiency after some optimization:
 With a single 2080Ti GPU and a 8 core AMD CPU, the training speed of rainbow for Atari could achieve 3000FPS, which means it can finish training of 10M frames within 1 hour. With compression of image frames, replay memory's RAM usage is down by 20%.
 I have tested several algorithms and games on Atari and get some initial result. Welcome to use and contribute!

I cannot find any valid reference that studies the effect of applying a soft constraint to the reward function instead of to the policy objective. This may seem useless for some applications, but it is highly relevant for finance, which is my domain of application,
 The idea I have so far is that if you constrain the reward, it is like you are imposing limits on the agent's behavior. On the other hand, if you constrain the objective, you are not limiting the behavior, but you are correcting the ex-post the undesired behavior. The latter way does not allow the agent to learn not to behave in a certain way.
 ​
 Did anyone ever think about it? Are they good references that analyze the different effects of a constraint to whatever DRL algorithm?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Artificial Intelligence is being used in almost every aspect of life. AI symbolizes growth and productivity in the minds of some, but it is raising questions as well on the fairness, privacy, and security of these systems. Many legitimate issues exist, including biased choices, labor replacement, and a lack of security. When it comes to robots, this is very frightening. Self-driving automobiles, for example, can cause injury or death if they make mistakes. Responsible AI addresses these difficulties and makes AI systems more accountable.
 Responsible AI should fulfill the following aims:
  
Interpretability: We obtain an explanation for how a model makes predictions when we interpret it. An AI system makes predictions for a user. Even if these selections are correct, a user is likely to seek an explanation. Responsible AI can describe how we create interpretable models.
 Fairness: AI systems have the potential to make judgments that are biased towards particular groups of people. Bias in the training data is the source of this bias. The easier it is to assure fairness and rectify any bias in a model, the more interpretable it is. As a result, we need a Responsible AI framework to explain how we evaluate fairness and what to do if a model makes unjust predictions.
 Safety and Security: AI systems aren’t deterministic. When confronted with new situations, they are prone to making poor choices. The systems can even be tampered with to make unwise decisions. Therefore, we need to ensure safety and security in these systems.
 Data Governance: The data used must be of high quality. If the data used by AI has errors, the system may make wrong decisions.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Artificial Intelligence and deep learning in video analytics are gaining popularity. It has enabled a wide range of industrial applications, including surveillance and public safety, robotics perception, medical intervention, and facial recognition. According to Markets & Markets, the global market for video analytics was valued at USD 5.9 billion in 2021 and is predicted to reach USD 14.9 billion by 2026.
 Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have also enabled a wide range of video analytics applications (e.g., aerial surveys) since they provide aerial views of the environment, allowing for collecting aerial photos and processing with deep learning algorithms. Parking analytics is one of these critical smart city applications that uses deep learning and UAVs to collect real-time data and analyze it in order to maximize parking revenue, enhance parking resource allocations, and better manage public space.

 In this example I have:
 https://ieeexplore-1ieee-1org-1000007l206e9.han.bg.pg.edu.pl/document/9514609
 And they train LR model on Covid19 dataset [death/ didn't die] so it's binary classification problem However later on, they construct nomogram, which determines whether there is low/moderate/high risk of covid19 mortality. What I don't undestand is how they calculate the score the establish chances of death. E.G. If the score is <0.05 there is low possibility that patient will die.
 My general question is, how they constructed this nomogram from the binary classifier they had?

 We are looking at Rubik’s Cube as target problem, and kicking off a project which will start from https://github.com/forestagostinelli/DeepCubeA and go from there.
 Prior works require hand crafted curriculum and billion of interactions to solve a cube, we believe that order of magnitude more compute that it should take.
 Is anyone interested to collaborate? I'm happy to dedicate a few hours a week to help a newcomer like I was a few years ago with the RL stuff given some basics of machine learning and programming skills, and this could be the golden opportunity for someone to see RL at scale.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello everyone,
 there is a lot of work in the field of geometric deep learning for combinatorial optimization that yields good approximation algorithms for "hard" problems on graphs (see here), with the most prominent example being the TSP problem. However, as far as I can see, all these considered problems share the fact that the computed solution is a subset of the vertices/edges of the original graph. In my field (graph drawing), one of the most important considered properties is the crossing number). Hence, the solution would not consists of a labeling of the edges/vertices, but is rather a regression task on the whole graph. I have a dataset that consists of roughly 10000 graphs together with their crossing number. Treating the above problem as a supervised regression task and simply inserting the graph into a GNN does not work for me at all - is this a problem of my choice of architecture or is this sort of "function" that maps a graph to its crossing number something we can expect no current architecture to find.
 I appreciate any comment, even if it is just your intuition on the problem.
 Best regards,
 MrLemming

 https://preview.redd.it/49ydy9bo61r81.png?width=665&format=png&auto=webp&s=729743449d6a99d2b84b81610e7e32d87ea4dfeb
 I am trying to understand the following two things about this graph:
 ​
  
What is PetaFLOP/s-days? I read that a PetaFLOP is 1,000,000,000,000,000 calculations (e.g. addition, subtraction). I am guessing that 10^2 would imply 100 * 1,000,000,000,000,000 calculations per day - is this correct? Is there any difference between PetaFLOP/days and PetaFLOP/s-days? (I also find it interesting they are probably referring to "computer resources" as simply "compute")
 What does "C" stand for in L = 2.57 * C^-0.048? I am guessing that the "dotted line" probably refers to the "average loss" for different Neural Networks with differing amounts of Parameters - but what exactly does "C" stand for?
 Finally, is there a reason that "Validation Loss" is not expressed as a percentage? For instance, what is a Validation Loss of 3? Is a Validation Loss of 3 the same as a Loss of 30%? Or does Validation Loss simply refer to the value of the Loss Function obtained during the Validation stage of Cross Validation?
  
Thank you!

shots of an individual. MyStyle allows to reconstruct, enhance and edit images
of a specific person, such that the output is faithful to the person's key
facial characteristics. Given a small reference set of portrait images of a
person (~100), we tune the weights of a pretrained StyleGAN face generator to
form a local, low-dimensional, personalized manifold in the latent space. We
show that this manifold constitutes a personalized region that spans latent
codes associated with diverse portrait images of the individual. Moreover, we
demonstrate that we obtain a personalized generative prior, and propose a
unified approach to apply it to various ill-posed image enhancement problems,
such as inpainting and super-resolution, as well as semantic editing. Using the
personalized generative prior we obtain outputs that exhibit high-fidelity to
the input images and are also faithful to the key facial characteristics of the
individual in the reference set. We demonstrate our method with fair-use images
of numerous widely recognizable individuals for whom we have the prior
knowledge for a qualitative evaluation of the expected outcome. We evaluate our
approach against few-shots baselines and show that our personalized prior,
quantitatively and qualitatively, outperforms state-of-the-art alternatives.]]></summary>

prototypical networks in speaker verification and to increase the
discriminability of the speaker embeddings, we train the model to classify

by extracting more information from a given meta-learning episode with

used deep learning networks, and extensively used in both academia and
industry. Recent studies demonstrated that adversarial attacks against such
models can maintain their effectiveness even when used on models other than the
one targeted by the attacker. This major property is known as transferability,
and makes CNNs ill-suited for security applications. In this paper, we provide
the first comprehensive study which assesses the robustness of CNN-based models
for computer networks against adversarial transferability. Furthermore, we
investigate whether the transferability property issue holds in computer
networks applications. In our experiments, we first consider five different
attacks: the Iterative Fast Gradient Method (I-FGSM), the Jacobian-based
Saliency Map (JSMA), the Limited-memory Broyden Fletcher Goldfarb Shanno BFGS
(L- BFGS), the Projected Gradient Descent (PGD), and the DeepFool attack. Then,
we perform these attacks against three well- known datasets: the Network-based
Detection of IoT (N-BaIoT) dataset, the Domain Generating Algorithms (DGA)
dataset, and the RIPE Atlas dataset. Our experimental results show clearly that
the transferability happens in specific use cases for the I- FGSM, the JSMA,
and the LBFGS attack. In such scenarios, the attack success rate on the target
network range from 63.00% to 100%. Finally, we suggest two shielding strategies
to hinder the attack transferability, by considering the Most Powerful Attacks
(MPAs), and the mismatch LSTM architecture.]]></summary>

diversified applications that demand real-time interaction. However, due to the
mobility of the end-users and the dynamic edge environment, it becomes
challenging to handle the task offloading with high performance. Moreover,
since each application in mobile devices has different characteristics, a task
orchestrator must be adaptive and have the ability to learn the dynamics of the
environment. For this purpose, we develop a deep reinforcement learning based
task orchestrator, DeepEdge, which learns to meet different task requirements
without needing human interaction even under the heavily-loaded stochastic
network conditions in terms of mobile users and applications. Given the dynamic
offloading requests and time-varying communication conditions, we successfully
model the problem as a Markov process and then apply the Double Deep Q-Network
(DDQN) algorithm to implement DeepEdge. To evaluate the robustness of DeepEdge,
we experiment with four different applications including image rendering,
infotainment, pervasive health, and augmented reality in the network under
various loads. Furthermore, we compare the performance of our agent with the
four different task offloading approaches in the literature. Our results show
that DeepEdge outperforms its competitors in terms of the percentage of

model-based reinforcement learning. Model-based RL has two main steps. First,
we systematically cover approaches to dynamics model learning, including
challenges like dealing with stochasticity, uncertainty, partial observability,
and temporal abstraction. Second, we present a systematic categorization of
planning-learning integration, including aspects like: where to start planning,
what budgets to allocate to planning and real data collection, how to plan, and
how to integrate planning in the learning and acting loop. After these two
sections, we also discuss implicit model-based RL as an end-to-end alternative
for model learning and planning, and we cover the potential benefits of
model-based RL. Along the way, the survey also draws connections to several

editing. To address its core challenge of attribute decoupling in a single
latent space, attempts have been made to adopt dual-space GAN for better

methods are still incompetent to obtain plausible editing results with high
controllability, especially for complicated attributes. In this study, we
highlight the importance of interaction in a dual-space GAN for more

representing high-dimensional distributions with structure. Recent years have
also seen big advances in designing multi-item mechanisms. Akin to overfitting,
however, these mechanisms can be extremely sensitive to the Bayesian prior that
they target, which becomes problematic when that prior is only approximately
known. At the same time, even if access to the exact Bayesian prior is given,
it is known that optimal or even approximately optimal multi-item mechanisms
run into sample, computational, representation and communication intractability
barriers.

We consider a natural class of multi-item mechanism design problems with very
large numbers of items, but where the bidders' value distributions can be
well-approximated by a topic model akin to those used in recommendation systems
with very large numbers of possible recommendations. We propose a mechanism
design framework for this setting, building on a recent robustification
framework by Brustle et al., which disentangles the statistical challenge of
estimating a multi-dimensional prior from the task of designing a good
mechanism for it, and robustifies the performance of the latter against the
estimation error of the former. We provide an extension of this framework
appropriate for our setting, which allows us to exploit the expressive power of
topic models to reduce the effective dimensionality of the mechanism design
problem and remove the dependence of its computational, communication and
representation complexity on the number of items.]]></summary>

approach to identify a sub-collection of features that ensure the fairness of
the dataset by performing conditional independence tests between different
subsets of features. We use group testing to improve the complexity of the
approach. We theoretically prove the correctness of the proposed algorithm to
identify features that ensure interventional fairness and show that sub-linear
conditional independence tests are sufficient to identify these variables. A

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Multi-agent reinforcement learning has made substantial empirical progresses
in solving games with a large number of players. However, theoretically, the
best known sample complexity for finding a Nash equilibrium in general-sum
games scales exponentially in the number of players due to the size of the
joint action space, and there is a matching exponential lower bound. This paper
investigates what learning goals admit better sample complexities in the
setting of $m$-player general-sum Markov games with $H$ steps, $S$ states, and
$A_i$ actions per player. First, we design algorithms for learning an
$\epsilon$-Coarse Correlated Equilibrium (CCE) in
$\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(H^5S\max_{i\le m} A_i / \epsilon^2)$ episodes, and an
$\epsilon$-Correlated Equilibrium (CE) in
$\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(H^6S\max_{i\le m} A_i^2 / \epsilon^2)$ episodes. This
is the first line of results for learning CCE and CE with sample complexities
polynomial in $\max_{i\le m} A_i$. Our algorithm for learning CE integrates an
adversarial bandit subroutine which minimizes a weighted swap regret, along
with several novel designs in the outer loop. Second, we consider the important
special case of Markov Potential Games, and design an algorithm that learns an
$\epsilon$-approximate Nash equilibrium within
$\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(S\sum_{i\le m} A_i / \epsilon^3)$ episodes (when only
highlighting the dependence on $S$, $A_i$, and $\epsilon$), which only depends
linearly in $\sum_{i\le m} A_i$ and significantly improves over existing
efficient algorithm in the $\epsilon$ dependence. Overall, our results shed
light on what equilibria or structural assumptions on the game may enable
sample-efficient learning with many players.]]></summary>

recently emerge as a scalable alternative to reinforcement learning (RL)
approaches such as Q-learning or policy gradient, and are much faster when many
central processing units (CPUs) are available due to better parallelization. In
this paper, we propose a systematic incremental learning method for ES in
dynamic environments. The goal is to adjust previously learned policy to a new
one incrementally whenever the environment changes. We incorporate an instance
weighting mechanism with ES to facilitate its learning adaptation, while
retaining scalability of ES. During parameter updating, higher weights are
assigned to instances that contain more new knowledge, thus encouraging the
search distribution to move towards new promising areas of parameter space. We
propose two easy-to-implement metrics to calculate the weights: instance
novelty and instance quality. Instance novelty measures an instance's
difference from the previous optimum in the original environment, while
instance quality corresponds to how well an instance performs in the new
environment. The resulting algorithm, Instance Weighted Incremental Evolution
Strategies (IW-IES), is verified to achieve significantly improved performance
on challenging RL tasks ranging from robot navigation to locomotion. This paper
thus introduces a family of scalable ES algorithms for RL domains that enables
rapid learning adaptation to dynamic environments.]]></summary>

computationally expensive and adding new speakers to the dataset requires the

phenomenon is known as catastrophic forgetting. In this paper, we look at TTS
modeling from a continual learning perspective, where the goal is to add new
speakers without forgetting previous speakers. Therefore, we first propose an
experimental setup and show that serial fine-tuning for new speakers can cause
the forgetting of the earlier speakers. Then we exploit two well-known
techniques for continual learning, namely experience replay and weight
regularization. We reveal how one can mitigate the effect of degradation in
speech synthesis diversity in sequential training of new speakers using these
methods. Finally, we present a simple extension to experience replay to improve
the results in extreme setups where we have access to very small buffers.]]></summary>

a neighborhood of ${\boldsymbol x}$, we characterize the joint distribution of

NLP field, but also vision and multimodal systems. However, although
visualization and interpretability tools have become available for NLP models,
internal mechanisms of vision and multimodal transformers remain largely
opaque. With the success of these transformers, it is increasingly critical to
understand their inner workings, as unraveling these black-boxes will lead to
more capable and trustworthy models. To contribute to this quest, we propose
VL-InterpreT, which provides novel interactive visualizations for interpreting
the attentions and hidden representations in multimodal transformers.
VL-InterpreT is a task agnostic and integrated tool that (1) tracks a variety
of statistics in attention heads throughout all layers for both vision and
language components, (2) visualizes cross-modal and intra-modal attentions
through easily readable heatmaps, and (3) plots the hidden representations of
vision and language tokens as they pass through the transformer layers. In this
paper, we demonstrate the functionalities of VL-InterpreT through the analysis
of KD-VLP, an end-to-end pretraining vision-language multimodal
transformer-based model, in the tasks of Visual Commonsense Reasoning (VCR) and
WebQA, two visual question answering benchmarks. Furthermore, we also present a

in addressing the challenge of climate change. One of the drawbacks of
wind-generated energy is the large space necessary to install a wind farm; this
arises from the fact that placing wind turbines in a limited area would hinder
their productivity and therefore not be economically convenient. This naturally
leads to an optimisation problem, which has three specific challenges: (1)
multiple conflicting objectives (2) computationally expensive simulation models
and (3) optimisation over design sets instead of design vectors. The first and
second challenges can be addressed by using surrogate-assisted e.g.\ Bayesian
multi-objective optimisation. However, the traditional Bayesian optimisation
cannot be applied as the optimisation function in the problem relies on design
sets instead of design vectors. This paper extends the applicability of
Bayesian multi-objective optimisation to set based optimisation for solving the
wind farm layout problem. We use a set-based kernel in Gaussian process to
quantify the correlation between wind farms (with a different number of
turbines). The results on the given data set of wind energy and direction
clearly show the potential of using set-based Bayesian multi-objective
optimisation.]]></summary>

other shift. Overall, we position existing datasets and algorithms from

collect and publish a new dataset consisting of 37.9 hours of found audio
recordings of celebrities and politicians, of which 17.2 hours are deepfakes.
We find that related work performs poorly on such real-world data (performance
degradation of up to one thousand percent). This may suggest that the community
has tailored its solutions too closely to the prevailing ASVSpoof benchmark and
that deepfakes are much harder to detect outside the lab than previously
thought.]]></summary>

a finite-dimensional quantum wave function. By projecting the quantum state of

higher requirements for physicians to handle and integrate the heterogeneous,
yet complementary data that are produced during routine practice. For instance,
the personalized diagnosis and treatment planning for a single cancer patient
relies on the various images (e.g., radiological, pathological, and camera
images) and non-image data (e.g., clinical data and genomic data). However,
such decision-making procedures can be subjective, qualitative, and have large
inter-subject variabilities. With the recent advances in multi-modal deep
learning technologies, an increasingly large number of efforts have been
devoted to a key question: how do we extract and aggregate multi-modal
information to ultimately provide more objective, quantitative computer-aided
clinical decision making? This paper reviews the recent studies on dealing with
such a question. Briefly, this review will include the (1) overview of current
multi-modal learning workflows, (2) summarization of multi-modal fusion
methods, (3) discussion of the performance, (4) applications in disease
diagnosis and prognosis, and (5) challenges and future directions.]]></summary>

(sEMG) signals has recently shown significant potential for development of
advanced myoelectric-controlled prosthesis. Existing deep learning approaches,
typically, include only one model as such can hardly maintain acceptable
generalization performance in changing scenarios. In this paper, we aim to
address this challenge by capitalizing on the recent advances of hybrid models
and transformers. In other words, we propose a hybrid framework based on the
transformer architecture, which is a relatively new and revolutionizing deep
learning model. The proposed hybrid architecture, referred to as the
Transformer for Hand Gesture Recognition (TraHGR), consists of two parallel
paths followed by a linear layer that acts as a fusion center to integrate the
advantage of each module and provide robustness over different scenarios. We
evaluated the proposed architecture TraHGR based on the commonly used second
Ninapro dataset, referred to as the DB2. The sEMG signals in the DB2 dataset
are measured in the real-life conditions from 40 healthy users, each performing
49 gestures. We have conducted extensive set of experiments to test and
validate the proposed TraHGR architecture, and have compared its achievable
accuracy with more than five recently proposed HGR classification algorithms
over the same dataset. We have also compared the results of the proposed TraHGR
architecture with each individual path and demonstrated the distinguishing
power of the proposed hybrid architecture. The recognition accuracies of the
proposed TraHGR architecture are 86.18%, 88.91%, 81.44%, and 93.84%, which are
2.48%, 5.12%, 8.82%, and 4.30% higher than the state-ofthe-art performance for
DB2 (49 gestures), DB2-B (17 gestures), DB2-C (23 gestures), and DB2-D (9

6D pose and a grasp reference, our goal is to generate motions that move the
object to a target 6D pose. This is challenging, because it requires reasoning
about the complex articulation of the human hand and the intricate physical
interaction with the object. We propose a novel method that frames this problem
in the reinforcement learning framework and leverages a physics simulation,
both to learn and to evaluate such dynamic interactions. A hierarchical
approach decomposes the task into low-level grasping and high-level motion
synthesis. It can be used to generate novel hand sequences that approach,
grasp, and move an object to a desired location, while retaining
human-likeness. We show that our approach leads to stable grasps and generates
a wide range of motions. Furthermore, even imperfect labels can be corrected by
our method to generate dynamic interaction sequences.]]></summary>

achieve promising performance via end-to-end phoneme recognition. One challenge
of such end-to-end solutions is the scarcity of human-annotated phonemes on
natural L2 speech. In this work, we leverage unlabeled L2 speech via a
pseudo-labeling (PL) procedure and extend the fine-tuning approach based on
pre-trained self-supervised learning (SSL) models. Specifically, we use Wav2vec
2.0 as our SSL model, and fine-tune it using original labeled L2 speech samples
plus the created pseudo-labeled L2 speech samples. Our pseudo labels are
dynamic and are produced by an ensemble of the online model on-the-fly, which
ensures that our model is robust to pseudo label noise. We show that
fine-tuning with pseudo labels gains a 5.35% phoneme error rate reduction and
2.48% MDD F1 score improvement over a labeled-samples-only fine-tuning
baseline. The proposed PL method is also shown to outperform conventional
offline PL methods. Compared to the state-of-the-art MDD systems, our MDD
solution achieves a more accurate and consistent phonetic error diagnosis. In
addition, we conduct an open test on a separate UTD-4Accents dataset, where our

data; hence, label noise is inevitable. Training with such noisy data
negatively impacts the generalization performance of deep neural networks. To
combat label noise, recent state-of-the-art methods employ some sort of sample
selection mechanism to select a possibly clean subset of data. Next, an
off-the-shelf semi-supervised learning method is used for training where
rejected samples are treated as unlabeled data. Our comprehensive analysis
shows that current selection methods disproportionately select samples from
easy (fast learnable) classes while rejecting those from relatively harder
ones. This creates class imbalance in the selected clean set and in turn,
deteriorates performance under high label noise. In this work, we propose
UNICON, a simple yet effective sample selection method which is robust to high
label noise. To address the disproportionate selection of easy and hard
samples, we introduce a Jensen-Shannon divergence based uniform selection
mechanism which does not require any probabilistic modeling and hyperparameter
tuning. We complement our selection method with contrastive learning to further
combat the memorization of noisy labels. Extensive experimentation on multiple
benchmark datasets demonstrates the effectiveness of UNICON; we obtain an 11.4%
improvement over the current state-of-the-art on CIFAR100 dataset with a 90%
noise rate. Our code is publicly available]]></summary>

focus on bad-classified examples and ignore well-classified examples that are
far from the decision boundary. For instance, when training with cross-entropy
loss, examples with higher likelihoods (i.e., well-classified examples)
contribute smaller gradients in back-propagation. However, we theoretically
show that this common practice hinders representation learning, energy
optimization, and margin growth. To counteract this deficiency, we propose to
reward well-classified examples with additive bonuses to revive their
contribution to the learning process. This counterexample theoretically
addresses these three issues. We empirically support this claim by directly
verifying the theoretical results or significant performance improvement with
our counterexample on diverse tasks, including image classification, graph
classification, and machine translation. Furthermore, this paper shows that we
can deal with complex scenarios, such as imbalanced classification, OOD
detection, and applications under adversarial attacks because our idea can

multi-label classification problem. In this paper, we reformulate this task as
a single-label prediction problem by encoding multiple binary labels into a
single label with the power set, which represents the possible combinations of
target speakers. This formulation has two benefits. First, the overlaps of
target speakers are explicitly modeled. Second, threshold selection is no
longer needed. Through this formulation, we propose the speaker embedding-aware
neural diarization (SEND) framework, where a speech encoder, a speaker encoder,
two similarity scorers, and a post-processing network are jointly optimized to
predict the encoded labels according to the similarities between speech
features and speaker embeddings. Experimental results show that SEND has a
stable learning process and can be trained on highly overlapped data without
extra initialization. More importantly, our method achieves the

perception. These two problems, however, are largely studied in isolation by
the community. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end approach for detection
and motion forecasting based on raw sensor measurement as opposed to ground
truth tracks. Instead of predicting the current frame locations and forecasting
forward in time, we directly predict future object locations and backcast to
determine where each trajectory began. Our approach not only improves overall
accuracy compared to other modular or end-to-end baselines, it also prompts us
to rethink the role of explicit tracking for embodied perception. Additionally,
by linking future and current locations in a many-to-one manner, our approach
is able to reason about multiple futures, a capability that was previously
considered difficult for end-to-end approaches. We conduct extensive
experiments on the popular nuScenes dataset and demonstrate the empirical
effectiveness of our approach. In addition, we investigate the appropriateness
of reusing standard forecasting metrics for an end-to-end setup, and find a
number of limitations which allow us to build simple baselines to game these
metrics. We address this issue with a novel set of joint forecasting and
detection metrics that extend the commonly used AP metrics from the detection
community to measuring forecasting accuracy. Our code is available at

people's daily lives: healthcare, home, transportation, manufacturing, supply
chain, and so on. With the recent development of sensor and communication
technologies, IoT devices including smart wearables, cameras, smartwatches, and
autonomous vehicles can accurately measure and perceive their surrounding
environment. Continuous sensing generates massive amounts of data and presents
challenges for machine learning. Deep learning models (e.g., convolution neural
networks and recurrent neural networks) have been extensively employed in
solving IoT tasks by learning patterns from multi-modal sensory data. Graph
Neural Networks (GNNs), an emerging and fast-growing family of neural network
models, can capture complex interactions within sensor topology and have been
demonstrated to achieve state-of-the-art results in numerous IoT learning
tasks. In this survey, we present a comprehensive review of recent advances in
the application of GNNs to the IoT field, including a deep dive analysis of GNN
design in various IoT sensing environments, an overarching list of public data
and source code from the collected publications, and future research
directions. To keep track of newly published works, we collect representative
papers and their open-source implementations and create a Github repository at

used in many natural language processing tasks. Converting the vocabulary in a
legal document into a word embedding model facilitates subjecting legal
documents to machine learning, deep learning, and other algorithms and
subsequently performing the downstream tasks of natural language processing
vis-\`a-vis, for instance, document classification, contract review, and
machine translation. The most common and practical approach of accuracy
evaluation with the word embedding model uses a benchmark set with linguistic
rules or the relationship between words to perform analogy reasoning via
algebraic calculation. This paper proposes establishing a 1,134 Legal
Analogical Reasoning Questions Set (LARQS) from the 2,388 Chinese Codex corpus
using five kinds of legal relations, which are then used to evaluate the
accuracy of the Chinese word embedding model. Moreover, we discovered that
legal relations might be ubiquitous in the word embedding model.]]></summary>

are scarce, we propose a novel estimator of the out-of-sample performance of a
policy in data-driven optimization.Our approach exploits the optimization
problem's sensitivity analysis to estimate the gradient of the optimal
objective value with respect to the amount of noise in the data and uses the
estimated gradient to debias the policy's in-sample performance. Unlike
cross-validation techniques, our approach avoids sacrificing data for a test
set, utilizes all data when training and, hence, is well-suited to settings
where data are scarce. We prove bounds on the bias and variance of our
estimator for optimization problems with uncertain linear objectives but known,
potentially non-convex, feasible regions. For more specialized optimization
problems where the feasible region is "weakly-coupled" in a certain sense, we
prove stronger results. Specifically, we provide explicit high-probability
bounds on the error of our estimator that hold uniformly over a policy class
and depends on the problem's dimension and policy class's complexity. Our
bounds show that under mild conditions, the error of our estimator vanishes as
the dimension of the optimization problem grows, even if the amount of
available data remains small and constant. Said differently, we prove our
estimator performs well in the small-data, large-scale regime. Finally, we
numerically compare our proposed method to state-of-the-art approaches through
a case-study on dispatching emergency medical response services using real
data. Our method provides more accurate estimates of out-of-sample performance

discovery. An ideal multivariate spatial clustering should consider both
spatial contiguity and aspatial attributes. Existing spatial clustering
approaches may face challenges for discovering repeated geographic patterns
with spatial contiguity maintained. In this paper, we propose a Spatial
Toeplitz Inverse Covariance-Based Clustering (STICC) method that considers both
attributes and spatial relationships of geographic objects for multivariate
spatial clustering. A subregion is created for each geographic object serving
as the basic unit when performing clustering. A Markov random field is then
constructed to characterize the attribute dependencies of subregions. Using a
spatial consistency strategy, nearby objects are encouraged to belong to the
same cluster. To test the performance of the proposed STICC algorithm, we apply
it in two use cases. The comparison results with several baseline methods show
that the STICC outperforms others significantly in terms of adjusted rand index
and macro-F1 score. Join count statistics is also calculated and shows that the
spatial contiguity is well preserved by STICC. Such a spatial clustering method
may benefit various applications in the fields of geography, remote sensing,
transportation, and urban planning, etc.]]></summary>

situations where audit relevant distribution changes are not evident in the

where previous knowledge interferes with new information and will be entirely

overcome both challenges and designed to learn from a stream of journal entry

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In classification problems, supervised machine-learning methods outperform
traditional algorithms, thanks to the ability of neural networks to learn
complex patterns. However, in two-class classification tasks like anomaly or
fraud detection, unsupervised methods could do even better, because their
prediction is not limited to previously learned types of anomalies. An
intuitive approach of anomaly detection can be based on the distances from the
centers of mass of the two respective classes. Autoencoders, although trained
without supervision, can also detect anomalies: considering the center of mass
of the normal points, reconstructions have now radii, with largest radii most
likely indicating anomalous points. Of course, radii-based classification were
already possible without interposing an autoencoder. In any space, radial
classification can be operated, to some extent. In order to outperform it, we
proceed to radial deformations of data (i.e. centric compression or expansions
of axes) and autoencoder training. Any autoencoder that makes use of a data
center is here baptized a centric autoencoder (cAE). A special type is the cAE
trained with a uniformly compressed dataset, named the centripetal autoencoder
(cpAE). The new concept is studied here in relation with a schematic artificial
dataset, and the derived methods show consistent score improvements. But tested
on real banking data, our radial deformation supervised algorithms alone still
perform better that cAEs, as expected from most supervised methods;
nonetheless, in hybrid approaches, cAEs can be combined with a radial
deformation of space, improving its classification score. We expect that
centric autoencoders will become irreplaceable objects in anomaly live
detection based on geometry, thanks to their ability to stem naturally on
geometrical algorithms and to their native capability of detecting unknown
anomaly types.]]></summary>

heterogeneous traffic, another major challenge stems from random service rates
due to time-varying wireless communication channels. Various approaches for

heuristics and constrained optimization to combinatorics. Those methods are
tailored to specific network or application configuration and are usually
suboptimal. To this purpose, we resort to deep reinforcement learning (DRL) and

Standalone capsule networks have shown good results on comparatively simple

introducing deeper convolutional layers to extract important features before
passing through modules of capsule layers strategically to improve the

includes blocks of Squeeze-Excitation networks which use a stochastic sampling
approach for progressively reducing the spatial size thereby dynamically
recalibrating the channels by reconstructing their interdependencies without

in deep representation learning due to the data scarcity issues such as data
imbalance, unseen distribution, and domain shift. To address the
above-mentioned issues, a variety of methods have been devised to explore the
sample relationships in a vanilla way (i.e., from the perspectives of either
the input or the loss function), failing to explore the internal structure of
deep neural networks for learning with sample relationships. Inspired by this,
we propose to enable deep neural networks themselves with the ability to learn
the sample relationships from each mini-batch. Specifically, we introduce a
batch transformer module or BatchFormer, which is then applied into the batch
dimension of each mini-batch to implicitly explore sample relationships during
training. By doing this, the proposed method enables the collaboration of
different samples, e.g., the head-class samples can also contribute to the
learning of the tail classes for long-tailed recognition. Furthermore, to
mitigate the gap between training and testing, we share the classifier between
with or without the BatchFormer during training, which can thus be removed
during testing. We perform extensive experiments on over ten datasets and the
proposed method achieves significant improvements on different data scarcity
applications without any bells and whistles, including the tasks of long-tailed
recognition, compositional zero-shot learning, domain generalization, and
contrastive learning. Code will be made publicly available at

about speech content, it is not surprising that audio-visual speech enhancement
methods are more accurate than their audio-only counterparts. Yet,
state-of-the-art approaches still struggle to generate clean, realistic speech
without noise artifacts and unnatural distortions in challenging acoustic
environments. In this paper, we propose a novel audio-visual speech enhancement
framework for high-fidelity telecommunications in AR/VR. Our approach leverages
audio-visual speech cues to generate the codes of a neural speech codec,
enabling efficient synthesis of clean, realistic speech from noisy signals.
Given the importance of speaker-specific cues in speech, we focus on developing
personalized models that work well for individual speakers. We demonstrate the
efficacy of our approach on a new audio-visual speech dataset collected in an
unconstrained, large vocabulary setting, as well as existing audio-visual
datasets, outperforming speech enhancement baselines on both quantitative
metrics and human evaluation studies. Please see the supplemental video for

(SER) by utilizing both acoustic and linguistic cues of speech. However, the
potential association between state-of-the-art ASR models and the SER task has
yet to be investigated. In this paper, we propose a novel channel and
temporal-wise attention RNN (CTA-RNN) architecture based on the intermediate
representations of pre-trained ASR models. Specifically, the embeddings of a
large-scale pre-trained end-to-end ASR encoder contain both acoustic and
linguistic information, as well as the ability to generalize to different
speakers, making them well suited for downstream SER task. To further exploit
the embeddings from different layers of the ASR encoder, we propose a novel
CTA-RNN architecture to capture the emotional salient parts of embeddings in
both the channel and temporal directions. We evaluate our approach on two
popular benchmark datasets, IEMOCAP and MSP-IMPROV, using both within-corpus

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Obtaining human-like performance in NLP is often argued to require
compositional generalisation. Whether neural networks exhibit this ability is
usually studied by training models on highly compositional synthetic data.
However, compositionality in natural language is much more complex than the
rigid, arithmetic-like version such data adheres to, and artificial
compositionality tests thus do not allow us to determine how neural models deal
with more realistic forms of compositionality. In this work, we re-instantiate
three compositionality tests from the literature and reformulate them for
neural machine translation (NMT). Our results highlight that: i) unfavourably,
models trained on more data are more compositional; ii) models are sometimes
less compositional than expected, but sometimes more, exemplifying that
different levels of compositionality are required, and models are not always
able to modulate between them correctly; iii) some of the non-compositional
behaviours are mistakes, whereas others reflect the natural variation in data.
Apart from an empirical study, our work is a call to action: we should rethink
the evaluation of compositionality in neural networks and develop benchmarks
using real data to evaluate compositionality on natural language, where
composing meaning is not as straightforward as doing the math.]]></summary>

task-specific architectures and training objectives. As a result, it is hard to
transfer the learned knowledge and representations from one task to another,
thus restricting the generalization ability of existing recommendation
approaches, e.g., a sequential recommendation model can hardly be applied or
transferred to a review generation method. To deal with such issues,
considering that language grounding is a powerful medium to describe and
represent various problems or tasks, we present a flexible and unified
text-to-text paradigm called "Pretrain, Personalized Prompt, and Predict
Paradigm" (P5) for recommendation, which unifies various recommendation tasks
in a shared framework. In P5, all data such as user-item interactions, item
metadata, and user reviews are converted to a common format -- natural language
sequences. The rich information from natural language assist P5 to capture
deeper semantics for recommendation. P5 learns different tasks with the same
language modeling objective during pretraining. Thus, it possesses the
potential to serve as the foundation model for downstream recommendation tasks,
allows easy integration with other modalities, and enables instruction-based
recommendation, which will revolutionize the technical form of recommender
system towards universal recommendation engine. With adaptive personalized
prompt for different users, P5 is able to make predictions in a zero-shot or
few-shot manner and largely reduces the necessity for extensive fine-tuning. On
several recommendation benchmarks, we conduct experiments to show the
effectiveness of our generative approach. We will release our prompts and
pretrained P5 language model to help advance future research on Recommendation
as Language Processing (RLP) and Personalized Foundation Models.]]></summary>

effective in shape analysis and reconstruction tasks. Existing INRs require
point coordinates to learn the implicit level sets of the shape. When a normal
vector is available for each point, a higher fidelity representation can be
learned, however normal vectors are often not provided as raw data.
Furthermore, the method's initialization has been shown to play a crucial role
for surface reconstruction. In this paper, we propose a divergence guided shape
representation learning approach that does not require normal vectors as input.
We show that incorporating a soft constraint on the divergence of the distance
function favours smooth solutions that reliably orients gradients to match the
unknown normal at each point, in some cases even better than approaches that
use ground truth normal vectors directly. Additionally, we introduce a novel
geometric initialization method for sinusoidal INRs that further improves
convergence to the desired solution. We evaluate the effectiveness of our
approach on the task of surface reconstruction and shape space learning and
show SOTA performance compared to other unoriented methods. Code and model

objects using tools. Previous works have shown that differentiable physics
simulators provide gradients to the environment state and help trajectory
optimization to converge orders of magnitude faster than model-free
reinforcement learning algorithms for deformable object manipulation. However,
such gradient-based trajectory optimization typically requires access to the
full simulator states and can only solve short-horizon, single-skill tasks due
to local optima. In this work, we propose a novel framework, named DiffSkill,
that uses a differentiable physics simulator for skill abstraction to solve
long-horizon deformable object manipulation tasks from sensory observations. In
particular, we first obtain short-horizon skills using individual tools from a
gradient-based optimizer, using the full state information in a differentiable
simulator; we then learn a neural skill abstractor from the demonstration
trajectories which takes RGBD images as input. Finally, we plan over the skills
by finding the intermediate goals and then solve long-horizon tasks. We show
the advantages of our method in a new set of sequential deformable object
manipulation tasks compared to previous reinforcement learning algorithms and

drawn from a distribution similar to that of the training set. However, DNNs'
predictions are brittle and unreliable when the test samples are drawn from a
dissimilar distribution. This is a major concern for deployment in real-world
applications, where such behavior may come at a considerable cost, such as
industrial production lines, autonomous vehicles, or healthcare applications.
Contributions. We frame Out Of Distribution (OOD) detection in DNNs as a
statistical hypothesis testing problem. Tests generated within our proposed
framework combine evidence from the entire network. Unlike previous OOD
detection heuristics, this framework returns a $p$-value for each test sample.
It is guaranteed to maintain the Type I Error (T1E - incorrectly predicting OOD
for an actual in-distribution sample) for test data. Moreover, this allows to
combine several detectors while maintaining the T1E. Building on this
framework, we suggest a novel OOD procedure based on low-order statistics. Our
method achieves comparable or better results than state-of-the-art methods on
well-accepted OOD benchmarks, without retraining the network parameters or
assuming prior knowledge on the test distribution -- and at a fraction of the
computational cost.]]></summary>

making domains such as education, employment and driving automation. The
continued success of ML largely depends on our ability to trust the model we
are using. Recently, a new class of attacks called Backdoor Attacks have been
developed. These attacks undermine the user's trust in ML models. In this work,
we present NEO, a model agnostic framework to detect and mitigate such backdoor
attacks in image classification ML models. For a given image classification
model, our approach analyses the inputs it receives and determines if the model
is backdoored. In addition to this feature, we also mitigate these attacks by
determining the correct predictions of the poisoned images. An appealing
feature of NEO is that it can, for the first time, isolate and reconstruct the
backdoor trigger. NEO is also the first defence methodology, to the best of our
knowledge that is completely blackbox.

We have implemented NEO and evaluated it against three state of the art
poisoned models. These models include highly critical applications such as
traffic sign detection (USTS) and facial detection. In our evaluation, we show
that NEO can detect $\approx$88% of the poisoned inputs on average and it is as

unlabeled speech data to build robust end-to-end (E2E) acoustic models (AM)
that can be later fine-tuned on downstream tasks e.g., automatic speech

the data substantially differs between the pre-training and downstream

the robustness of Wav2Vec2.0 and XLS-R models on downstream ASR for a
completely unseen domain, i.e., air traffic control (ATC) communications. We
benchmark the proposed models on four challenging ATC test sets
(signal-to-noise ratio varies between 5 to 20 dB). Relative word error rate
(WER) reduction between 20% to 40% are obtained in comparison to hybrid-based
state-of-the-art ASR baselines by fine-tuning E2E acoustic models with a small

requirement for safely deploying machine learning models. As reported in
RobustBench, even the state-of-the-art adversarially trained models struggle to
exceed 67% robust test accuracy on CIFAR-10, which is far from practical. A
complementary way towards robustness is to introduce a rejection option,
allowing the model to not return predictions on uncertain inputs, where
confidence is a commonly used certainty proxy. Along with this routine, we find
that confidence and a rectified confidence (R-Con) can form two coupled
rejection metrics, which could provably distinguish wrongly classified inputs
from correctly classified ones. This intriguing property sheds light on using
coupling strategies to better detect and reject adversarial examples. We
evaluate our rectified rejection (RR) module on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-10-C, and
CIFAR-100 under several attacks including adaptive ones, and demonstrate that
the RR module is compatible with different adversarial training frameworks on
improving robustness, with little extra computation. The code is available at

optimization from the minimization of a single objective to the minimization of
an objective function that depends the solution of another optimization
problem. Recently, stochastic bilevel optimization is regaining popularity in
emerging machine learning applications such as hyper-parameter optimization and
model-agnostic meta learning. To solve this class of stochastic optimization
problems, existing methods require either double-loop or two-timescale updates,
which are sometimes less efficient. This paper develops a new optimization
method for a class of stochastic bilevel problems that we term Single-Timescale
stochAstic BiLevEl optimization (STABLE) method. STABLE runs in a single loop
fashion, and uses a single-timescale update with a fixed batch size. To achieve
an $\epsilon$-stationary point of the bilevel problem, STABLE requires ${\cal
O}(\epsilon^{-2})$ samples in total; and to achieve an $\epsilon$-optimal
solution in the strongly convex case, STABLE requires ${\cal O}(\epsilon^{-1})$
samples. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first bilevel optimization
algorithm achieving the same order of sample complexity as the stochastic
gradient descent method for the single-level stochastic optimization.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Vocal fry or creaky voice refers to a voice quality characterized by
irregular glottal opening and low pitch. It occurs in diverse languages and is
prevalent in American English, where it is used not only to mark phrase
finality, but also sociolinguistic factors and affect. Due to its irregular
periodicity, creaky voice challenges automatic speech processing and
recognition systems, particularly for languages where creak is frequently used.

This paper proposes a deep learning model to detect creaky voice in fluent
speech. The model is composed of an encoder and a classifier trained together.
The encoder takes the raw waveform and learns a representation using a
convolutional neural network. The classifier is implemented as a multi-headed
fully-connected network trained to detect creaky voice, voicing, and pitch,
where the last two are used to refine creak prediction. The model is trained
and tested on speech of American English speakers, annotated for creak by
trained phoneticians.

We evaluated the performance of our system using two encoders: one is
tailored for the task, and the other is based on a state-of-the-art
unsupervised representation. Results suggest our best-performing system has
improved recall and F1 scores compared to previous methods on unseen data.]]></summary>

constructed by an embodied agent navigating within a space, where objects and
their relationships are modeled by continuous valued embeddings. Our method
captures feature relationships between objects, composes them into a graph

Our key insight is to embed pair-wise relationships between objects in a latent
space. This allows for a richer representation compared to discrete relations
(e.g., [support], [next-to]) commonly used for building scene representations.
CSR can track objects as the agent moves in a scene, update the representation
accordingly, and detect changes in room configurations. Using CSR, we
outperform state-of-the-art approaches for the challenging downstream task of
visual room rearrangement, without any task specific training. Moreover, we
show the learned embeddings capture salient spatial details of the scene and
show applicability to real world data. A summery video and code is available at

("trajectories") of non-independent covariates, reflecting tasks in sequence
modeling, control, and reinforcement learning. Conceptually, our
multi-trajectory setup sits between two traditional settings in statistical
learning theory: learning from independent examples and learning from a single
auto-correlated sequence. Our conditions for efficient learning generalize the
former setting--trajectories must be non-degenerate in ways that extend
standard requirements for independent examples. They do not require that
trajectories be ergodic, long, nor strictly stable.

For linear least-squares regression, given $n$-dimensional examples produced
by $m$ trajectories, each of length $T$, we observe a notable change in
statistical efficiency as the number of trajectories increases from a few
(namely $m \lesssim n$) to many (namely $m \gtrsim n$). Specifically, we
establish that the worst-case error rate this problem is $\Theta(n / m T)$
whenever $m \gtrsim n$. Meanwhile, when $m \lesssim n$, we establish a (sharp)
lower bound of $\Omega(n^2 / m^2 T)$ on the worst-case error rate, realized by
a simple, marginally unstable linear dynamical system. A key upshot is that, in
domains where trajectories regularly reset, the error rate eventually behaves
as if all of the examples were independent altogether, drawn from their
marginals. As a corollary of our analysis, we also improve guarantees for the
linear system identification problem.]]></summary>

their repositories. An issue is a rich source of software information that
contains different reports including a problem, a request for new features, or
merely a question about the software product. As the number of these issues
increases, it becomes harder to manage them manually. Thus, automatic
approaches are proposed to help facilitate the management of issue reports.

This paper describes CatIss, an automatic CATegorizer of ISSue reports which
is built upon the Transformer-based pre-trained RoBERTa model. CatIss
classifies issue reports into three main categories of Bug reports,
Enhancement/feature requests, and Questions. First, the datasets provided for
the NLBSE tool competition are cleaned and preprocessed. Then, the pre-trained
RoBERTa model is fine-tuned on the preprocessed dataset. Evaluating CatIss on
about 80 thousand issue reports from GitHub, indicates that it performs very
well surpassing the competition baseline, TicketTagger, and achieving 87.2%
F1-score (micro average). Additionally, as CatIss is trained on a wide set of
repositories, it is a generic prediction model, hence applicable for any unseen
software project or projects with little historical data. Scripts for cleaning

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[To ease the burden of labeling, unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) aims to
transfer knowledge in previous and related labeled datasets (sources) to a new
unlabeled dataset (target). Despite impressive progress, prior methods always
need to access the raw source data and develop data-dependent alignment
approaches to recognize the target samples in a transductive learning manner,
which may raise privacy concerns from source individuals. Several recent
studies resort to an alternative solution by exploiting the well-trained
white-box model from the source domain, yet, it may still leak the raw data
through generative adversarial learning. This paper studies a practical and
interesting setting for UDA, where only black-box source models (i.e., only
network predictions are available) are provided during adaptation in the target
domain. To solve this problem, we propose a new two-step knowledge adaptation
framework called DIstill and fine-tuNE (DINE). Taking into consideration the
target data structure, DINE first distills the knowledge from the source
predictor to a customized target model, then fine-tunes the distilled model to
further fit the target domain. Besides, neural networks are not required to be
identical across domains in DINE, even allowing effective adaptation on a
low-resource device. Empirical results on three UDA scenarios (i.e.,
single-source, multi-source, and partial-set) confirm that DINE achieves highly
competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art data-dependent approaches.

challenge in scientific computing. We develop a new numerical method for
solving elliptic-type PDEs by adapting the Q-learning algorithm in

the potential to overcome the curse of dimensionality. Using a neural tangent

PDE solution, trained with the Q-PDE algorithm, converges to the trajectory of
an infinite-dimensional ordinary differential equation (ODE) as the number of
hidden units $\rightarrow \infty$. For monotone PDE (i.e. those given by
monotone operators, which may be nonlinear), despite the lack of a spectral gap
in the NTK, we then prove that the limit neural network, which satisfies the
infinite-dimensional ODE, converges in $L^2$ to the PDE solution as the
training time $\rightarrow \infty$. More generally, we can prove that any fixed
point of the wide-network limit for the Q-PDE algorithm is a solution of the
PDE (not necessarily under the monotone condition). The numerical performance

of classification due to high quantization errors. Interestingly, however, we
observe that the quantization could provide comparable and often superior

a firm operating an algorithmic system, such as a digital content
recommendation platform, to steer a population. We relate performative power to
the economic theory of market power. Traditional economic concepts are well
known to struggle with identifying anti-competitive patterns in digital
platforms--a core challenge is the difficulty of defining the market, its
participants, products, and prices. Performative power sidesteps the problem of
market definition by focusing on a directly observable statistical measure
instead. High performative power enables a platform to profit from steering
participant behavior, whereas low performative power ensures that learning from
historical data is close to optimal.

Our first general result shows that under low performative power, a firm
cannot do better than standard supervised learning on observed data. We draw an
analogy with a firm being a price-taker, an economic condition that arises
under perfect competition in classical market models. We then contrast this
with a market where performative power is concentrated and show that the
equilibrium state can differ significantly. We go on to study performative
power in a concrete setting of strategic classification where participants can
switch between competing firms. We show that monopolies maximize performative
power and disutility for the participant, while competition and outside options
decrease performative power. We end on a discussion of connections to measures
of market power in economics and of the relationship with ongoing antitrust
debates.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dealing with non-stationarity in environments (i.e., transition dynamics) and
objectives (i.e., reward functions) is a challenging problem that is crucial in
real-world applications of reinforcement learning (RL). Most existing
approaches only focus on families of stationary MDPs, in which the
non-stationarity is episodic, i.e., the change is only possible across
episodes. The few works that do consider non-stationarity without a specific
boundary, i.e., also allow for changes within an episode, model the changes
monolithically in a single shared embedding vector. In this paper, we propose
Factored Adaptation for Non-Stationary RL (FANS-RL), a factored adaption
approach that explicitly learns the individual latent change factors affecting
the transition dynamics and reward functions. FANS-RL learns jointly the
structure of a factored MDP and a factored representation of the time-varying
change factors, as well as the specific state components that they affect, via
a factored non-stationary variational autoencoder. Through this general
framework, we can consider general non-stationary scenarios with different
changing function types and changing frequency. Experimental results
demonstrate that FANS-RL outperforms existing approaches in terms of rewards,
compactness of the latent state representation and robustness to varying
degrees of non-stationarity.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Continual learning describes a setting where machine learning models learn
novel concepts from continuously shifting training data, while simultaneously
avoiding degradation of knowledge on previously seen classes (a phenomenon
known as the catastrophic forgetting problem) which may disappear from the
training data for extended periods of time. Current approaches for continual
learning of a single expanding task (aka class-incremental continual learning)
require extensive rehearsal of previously seen data to avoid this degradation
of knowledge. Unfortunately, rehearsal comes at a sharp cost to memory and
computation, and it may also violate data-privacy. Instead, we explore
combining knowledge distillation and parameter regularization in new ways to
achieve strong continual learning performance without rehearsal. Specifically,
we take a deep dive into common continual learning techniques: prediction
distillation, feature distillation, L2 parameter regularization, and EWC
parameter regularization. We first disprove the common assumption that
parameter regularization techniques fail for rehearsal-free continual learning
of a single, expanding task. Next, we explore how to leverage knowledge from a
pre-trained model in rehearsal-free continual learning and find that vanilla L2
parameter regularization outperforms EWC parameter regularization and feature
distillation. We then highlight the impact of the rehearsal-free continual
learning settings with a classifier expansion benchmark, showing that a
strategy based on our findings combined with a positive/negative label
balancing heuristic can close the performance gap between the upper bound and
the existing strategies by up to roughly 50%. Finally, we show that a simple
method consisting of pre-training, L2 regularization, and prediction
distillation can even outperform rehearsal-based methods on the common
CIFAR-100 benchmark.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Schizophrenia is a severe mental health condition that requires a long and
complicated diagnostic process. However, early diagnosis is vital to control
symptoms. Deep learning has recently become a popular way to analyse and
interpret medical data. Past attempts to use deep learning for schizophrenia
diagnosis from brain-imaging data have shown promise but suffer from a large
training-application gap - it is difficult to apply lab research to the real
world. We propose to reduce this training-application gap by focusing on
readily accessible data. We collect a data set of psychiatric observations of
patients based on DSM-5 criteria. Because similar data is already recorded in
all mental health clinics that diagnose schizophrenia using DSM-5, our method
could be easily integrated into current processes as a tool to assist
clinicians, whilst abiding by formal diagnostic criteria. To facilitate
real-world usage of our system, we show that it is interpretable and robust.
Understanding how a machine learning tool reaches its diagnosis is essential to
allow clinicians to trust that diagnosis. To interpret the framework, we fuse
two complementary attention mechanisms, 'squeeze and excitation' and
'self-attention', to determine global attribute importance and attribute
interactivity, respectively. The model uses these importance scores to make
decisions. This allows clinicians to understand how a diagnosis was reached,
improving trust in the model. Because machine learning models often struggle to
generalise to data from different sources, we perform experiments with
augmented test data to evaluate the model's applicability to the real world. We
find that our model is more robust to perturbations, and should therefore
perform better in a clinical setting. It achieves 98% accuracy with 10-fold
cross-validation.]]></summary>

better representations while suppressing noise. We use a variant of Dynamic

variety of downstream tasks, these models have been observed to overfit to the

propose PADA (Pruning Assisted Domain Adaptation) and zero out redundant
weights from models pre-trained on large amounts of out-of-domain (OOD) data.
Intuitively, this helps to make space for the target-domain ASR finetuning. The
redundant weights can be identified through various pruning strategies which
have been discussed in detail as a part of this work. Specifically, we
investigate the effect of the recently discovered Task-Agnostic and Task-Aware
pruning on PADA and propose a new pruning paradigm based on the latter, which
we call Cross-Domain Task-Aware Pruning (CD-TAW). CD-TAW obtains the initial
pruning mask from a well fine-tuned OOD model, which makes it starkly different
from the rest of the pruning strategies discussed in the paper. Our proposed
CD-TAW methodology achieves up to 20.6% relative WER improvement over our

However, we often lack the ability to explain why a specific architecture
attains superior predictive accuracy for a given data set. Often, validation
accuracy is used as a performance heuristic quantifying how well a network

information flow in the model. Mutual information can be used as a measure of
the quality of internal representations in deep learning models, and the
information plane may provide insights into whether the model exploits the
available information in the data. The information plane has previously been
explored for fully connected neural networks and convolutional architectures.
We present an architecture-agnostic method for tracking a network's internal
representations during training, which are then used to create the mutual

Inverse-Propensity-Scoring (IPS) estimation. Unique about LTR is the fact that

a user examined an item - cannot be observed in the data. In this paper, we
introduce a novel DR estimator that uses the expectation of treatment per rank
instead. Our novel DR estimator has more robust unbiasedness conditions than
the existing IPS approach, and in addition, provides enormous decreases in
variance: our experimental results indicate it requires several orders of

a number of tokens in parallel as a draft through NAT and then verifies them in
the autoregressive manner, where only the tokens that pass the verification are
kept as decoded tokens. GAD can achieve the same performance as autoregressive
translation but much more efficiently because both NAT drafting and
autoregressive verification are fast due to parallel computing. We conduct
experiments in the WMT14 English-German translation task and confirm that the
vanilla GAD yields exactly the same results as greedy decoding with an around
3x speedup, and that its variant (GAD++) with an advanced verification strategy
not only outperforms the greedy translation and even achieves the comparable
translation quality with the beam search result, but also further improves the
decoding speed, resulting in an around 5x speedup over autoregressive
translation. Our models and codes are available at

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Recent neural network-based language models have benefited greatly from
scaling up the size of training datasets and the number of parameters in the
models themselves. Scaling can be complicated due to various factors including
the need to distribute computation on supercomputer clusters (e.g., TPUs),
prevent bottlenecks when infeeding data, and ensure reproducible results. In
this work, we present two software libraries that ease these issues:
$\texttt{t5x}$ simplifies the process of building and training large language
models at scale while maintaining ease of use, and $\texttt{seqio}$ provides a
task-based API for simple creation of fast and reproducible training data and
evaluation pipelines. These open-source libraries have been used to train
models with hundreds of billions of parameters on datasets with multiple
terabytes of training data.

Along with the libraries, we release configurations and instructions for
T5-like encoder-decoder models as well as GPT-like decoder-only architectures.

$\texttt{t5x}$ and $\texttt{seqio}$ are open source and available at
https://github.com/google-research/t5x and https://github.com/google/seqio,

Speech2C, for encoder-decoder based automatic speech recognition (ASR). Within
a multi-task learning framework, we introduce two pre-training tasks for the
encoder-decoder network using acoustic units, i.e., pseudo codes, derived from
an offline clustering model. One is to predict the pseudo codes via masked
language modeling in encoder output, like HuBERT model, while the other lets
the decoder learn to reconstruct pseudo codes autoregressively instead of
generating textual scripts. In this way, the decoder learns to reconstruct
original speech information with codes before learning to generate correct
text. Comprehensive experiments on the LibriSpeech corpus show that the
proposed Speech2C can relatively reduce the word error rate (WER) by 19.2% over
the method without decoder pre-training, and also outperforms significantly the
state-of-the-art wav2vec 2.0 and HuBERT on fine-tuning subsets of 10h and 100h.]]></summary>

learn reusable locomotion skills for real legged robots. Our approach builds
upon previous work on imitating human or dog Motion Capture (MoCap) data to
learn a movement skill module. Once learned, this skill module can be reused
for complex downstream tasks. Importantly, due to the prior imposed by the
MoCap data, our approach does not require extensive reward engineering to
produce sensible and natural looking behavior at the time of reuse. This makes
it easy to create well-regularized, task-oriented controllers that are suitable
for deployment on real robots. We demonstrate how our skill module can be used
for imitation, and train controllable walking and ball dribbling policies for
both the ANYmal quadruped and OP3 humanoid. These policies are then deployed on
hardware via zero-shot simulation-to-reality transfer. Accompanying videos are

implicit probabilistic models in discrete spaces, supporting distributions that
are practically infeasible to sample from using classical means. One of the
possible applications of such models, also known as Born machines, is
probabilistic inference, which is at the core of Bayesian methods. This paper
studies the use of Born machines for the problem of training binary Bayesian
neural networks. In the proposed approach, a Born machine is used to model the
variational distribution of the binary weights of the neural network, and data
from multiple tasks is used to reduce training data requirements on new tasks.
The method combines gradient-based meta-learning and variational inference via
Born machines, and is shown in a prototypical regression problem to outperform
conventional joint learning strategies.]]></summary>

neural networks can successfully predict future traffic conditions 1 hour into
the future on simply aggregated GPS probe data in time and space bins. We thus
reinterpreted the challenge of forecasting traffic conditions as a movie
completion task. U-Nets proved to be the winning architecture, demonstrating an
ability to extract relevant features in this complex real-world geo-spatial
process. Building on the previous competitions, Traffic4cast 2021 now focuses
on the question of model robustness and generalizability across time and space.
Moving from one city to an entirely different city, or moving from pre-COVID
times to times after COVID hit the world thus introduces a clear domain shift.
We thus, for the first time, release data featuring such domain shifts. The
competition now covers ten cities over 2 years, providing data compiled from
over 10^12 GPS probe data. Winning solutions captured traffic dynamics
sufficiently well to even cope with these complex domain shifts. Surprisingly,
this seemed to require only the previous 1h traffic dynamic history and static

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Recent advances in neural text-to-speech research have been dominated by
two-stage pipelines utilizing low-level intermediate speech representation such
as mel-spectrograms. However, such predetermined features are fundamentally
limited, because they do not allow to exploit the full potential of a
data-driven approach through learning hidden representations. For this reason,
several end-to-end methods have been proposed. However, such models are harder
to train and require a large number of high-quality recordings with
transcriptions. Here, we propose WavThruVec - a two-stage architecture that
resolves the bottleneck by using high-dimensional Wav2Vec 2.0 embeddings as
intermediate speech representation. Since these hidden activations provide
high-level linguistic features, they are more robust to noise. That allows us
to utilize annotated speech datasets of a lower quality to train the
first-stage module. At the same time, the second-stage component can be trained
on large-scale untranscribed audio corpora, as Wav2Vec 2.0 embeddings are
time-aligned and speaker-independent. This results in an increased
generalization capability to out-of-vocabulary words, as well as to a better
generalization to unseen speakers. We show that the proposed model not only
matches the quality of state-of-the-art neural models, but also presents useful
properties enabling tasks like voice conversion or zero-shot synthesis.]]></summary>

task first proposed by Cui et al. (2021) in the Who's Waldo dataset. Given an
image and a caption, PCVG requires pairing up a person's name mentioned in a
caption with a bounding box that points to the person in the image. We find
that the original Who's Waldo dataset compiled for this task contains a large
number of biased samples that are solvable simply by heuristic methods; for
instance, in many cases the first name in the sentence corresponds to the
largest bounding box, or the sequence of names in the sentence corresponds to
an exact left-to-right order in the image. Naturally, models trained on these
biased data lead to over-estimation of performance on the benchmark. To enforce
models being correct for the correct reasons, we design automated tools to
filter and debias the original dataset by ruling out all examples of
insufficient context, such as those with no verb or with a long chain of
conjunct names in their captions. Our experiments show that our new sub-sampled
dataset contains less bias with much lowered heuristic performances and widened
gaps between heuristic and supervised methods. We also demonstrate the same
benchmark model trained on our debiased training set outperforms that trained
on the original biased (and larger) training set on our debiased test set. We
argue our debiased dataset offers the PCVG task a more practical baseline for
reliable benchmarking and future improvements.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Vision transformer (ViT) has been trending in image classification tasks due
to its promising performance when compared to convolutional neural networks
(CNNs). As a result, many researchers have tried to incorporate ViT models in
hyperspectral image (HSI) classification tasks, but without achieving
satisfactory performance. To this paper, we introduce a new multimodal fusion
transformer (MFT) network for HSI land-cover classification, which utilizes
other sources of multimodal data in addition to HSI. Instead of using
conventional feature fusion techniques, other multimodal data are used as an
external classification (CLS) token in the transformer encoder, which helps
achieving better generalization. ViT and other similar transformer models use a
randomly initialized external classification token {and fail to generalize
well}. However, the use of a feature embedding derived from other sources of
multimodal data, such as light detection and ranging (LiDAR), offers the
potential to improve those models by means of a CLS. The concept of
tokenization is used in our work to generate CLS and HSI patch tokens, helping
to learn key features in a reduced feature space. We also introduce a new
attention mechanism for improving the exchange of information between HSI
tokens and the CLS (e.g., LiDAR) token. Extensive experiments are carried out
on widely used and benchmark datasets i.e., the University of Houston, Trento,
University of Southern Mississippi Gulfpark (MUUFL), and Augsburg. In the
results section, we compare the proposed MFT model with other state-of-the-art
transformer models, classical CNN models, as well as conventional classifiers.
The superior performance achieved by the proposed model is due to the use of
multimodal information as external classification tokens.]]></summary>

resource requirements of deep neural networks. To deal with the performance
drop induced by quantization errors, a popular method is to use training data
to fine-tune quantized networks. In real-world environments, however, such a
method is frequently infeasible because training data is unavailable due to
security, privacy, or confidentiality concerns. Zero-shot quantization
addresses such problems, usually by taking information from the weights of a
full-precision teacher network to compensate the performance drop of the
quantized networks. In this paper, we first analyze the loss surface of
state-of-the-art zero-shot quantization techniques and provide several
findings. In contrast to usual knowledge distillation problems, zero-shot
quantization often suffers from 1) the difficulty of optimizing multiple loss
terms together, and 2) the poor generalization capability due to the use of
synthetic samples. Furthermore, we observe that many weights fail to cross the
rounding threshold during training the quantized networks even when it is
necessary to do so for better performance. Based on the observations, we
propose AIT, a simple yet powerful technique for zero-shot quantization, which
addresses the aforementioned two problems in the following way: AIT i) uses a
KL distance loss only without a cross-entropy loss, and ii) manipulates
gradients to guarantee that a certain portion of weights are properly updated
after crossing the rounding thresholds. Experiments show that AIT outperforms
the performance of many existing methods by a great margin, taking over the
overall state-of-the-art position in the field.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Finding best architectures of learning machines, such as deep neural
networks, is a well-known technical and theoretical challenge. Recent work by
Mellor et al (2021) showed that there may exist correlations between the
accuracies of trained networks and the values of some easily computable
measures defined on randomly initialised networks which may enable to search
tens of thousands of neural architectures without training. Mellor et al used
the Hamming distance evaluated over all ReLU neurons as such a measure.
Motivated by these findings, in our work, we ask the question of the existence
of other and perhaps more principled measures which could be used as
determinants of success of a given neural architecture. In particular, we
examine, if the dimensionality and quasi-orthogonality of neural networks'
feature space could be correlated with the network's performance after
training. We showed, using the setup as in Mellor et al, that dimensionality
and quasi-orthogonality may jointly serve as network's performance

new methods have been suggested. On the other hand, a system that has true
versatility has not been developed, and there remain many fields in which the
human brain has advantages over machine learning. We considered how the human
brain recognizes events and memorizes them and succeeded to reproduce the
system of the human brain on a machine learning model with a new autoencoder
neural network (NN). The previous autoencoders have the problem that they
cannot define well what is the features of the input data, and we need to
restrict the middle layer of the autoencoder artificially. We solve this
problem by defining a new loss function that reflects the information entropy,
and it enables the NN to compress the input data ideally and automatically
discover the hidden law behind the input data set. The loss function used in
our NN is based on the free-energy principle which is known as the unified
brain theory, and our study is the first concrete formularization of this
principle. The result of this study can be applied to any kind of data analysis
and also to cognitive science.]]></summary>

have been found beneficial for various speech processing tasks. However,
utilizing SSL representations usually requires fine-tuning the pre-trained
models or designing task-specific downstream models and loss functions, causing
much memory usage and human labor. On the other hand, prompting in Natural
Language Processing (NLP) is an efficient and widely used technique to leverage
pre-trained language models (LMs). Nevertheless, such a paradigm is little
studied in the speech community. We report in this paper the first exploration
of the prompt tuning paradigm for speech processing tasks based on Generative
Spoken Language Model (GSLM). Experiment results show that the prompt tuning
technique achieves competitive performance in speech classification tasks with
fewer trainable parameters than fine-tuning specialized downstream models. We
further study the technique in challenging sequence generation tasks. Prompt
tuning also demonstrates its potential, while the limitation and possible
research directions are discussed in this paper.]]></summary>

introduce a priori knowledge about physical systems into the learning
framework. PINNs are known to be robust for smaller training sets, derive
better generalization problems, and are faster to train. In this paper, we show
that using PINNs in comparison with purely data-driven neural networks is not
only favorable for training performance but allows us to extract significant
information on the quality of the approximated solution. Assuming that the
underlying differential equation for the PINN training is an ordinary
differential equation, we derive a rigorous upper limit on the PINN prediction
error. This bound is applicable even for input data not included in the
training phase and without any prior knowledge about the true solution.
Therefore, our a posteriori error estimation is an essential step to certify
the PINN. We apply our error estimator exemplarily to two academic toy
problems, whereof one falls in the category of model-predictive control and
thereby shows the practical use of the derived results.]]></summary>

in mind, we propose new explainability metrics that measure the redundant

quantify a complexity measure that is highly correlated with the generalization
performance of a given optimizer, network, and dataset. We subsequently exploit
these metrics to augment the Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) optimizer by
adaptively adjusting the learning rate in each layer to improve in

minimal computational overhead compared to SOTA methods and outperforms them by
exhibiting strong generalization characteristics across application,

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Objective: The use of routinely-acquired medical data for research purposes
requires the protection of patient confidentiality via data anonymisation. The
objective of this work is to calculate the risk of re-identification arising
from a malicious attack to an anonymised dataset, as described below. Methods:
We first present an analytical means of estimating the probability of
re-identification of a single patient in a k-anonymised dataset of Electronic
Health Record (EHR) data. Second, we generalize this solution to obtain the
probability of multiple patients being re-identified. We provide synthetic
validation via Monte Carlo simulations to illustrate the accuracy of the
estimates obtained. Results: The proposed analytical framework for risk
estimation provides re-identification probabilities that are in agreement with
those provided by simulation in a number of scenarios. Our work is limited by
conservative assumptions which inflate the re-identification probability.
Discussion: Our estimates show that the re-identification probability increases
with the proportion of the dataset maliciously obtained and that it has an
inverse relationship with the equivalence class size. Our recursive approach
extends the applicability domain to the general case of a multi-patient
re-identification attack in an arbitrary k-anonymisation scheme. Conclusion: We
prescribe a systematic way to parametrize the k-anonymisation process based on
a pre-determined re-identification probability. We observed that the benefits
of a reduced re-identification risk that come with increasing k-size may not be
worth the reduction in data granularity when one is considering benchmarking
the re-identification probability on the size of the portion of the dataset
maliciously obtained by the adversary.]]></summary>

practice for learning a wide range of downstream tasks. The typical approach of
fine-tuning different models for each task is performant, but incurs a
substantial memory cost. To efficiently learn multiple downstream tasks we
introduce Task Adaptive Parameter Sharing (TAPS), a general method for tuning a
base model to a new task by adaptively modifying a small, task-specific subset
of layers. This enables multi-task learning while minimizing resources used and
competition between tasks. TAPS solves a joint optimization problem which
determines which layers to share with the base model and the value of the
task-specific weights. Further, a sparsity penalty on the number of active
layers encourages weight sharing with the base model. Compared to other
methods, TAPS retains high accuracy on downstream tasks while introducing few
task-specific parameters. Moreover, TAPS is agnostic to the model architecture
and requires only minor changes to the training scheme. We evaluate our method
on a suite of fine-tuning tasks and architectures (ResNet, DenseNet, ViT) and
show that it achieves state-of-the-art performance while being simple to
implement.]]></summary>

RNN-Transducer (RNN-T) for speech recognition is challenging. Recently, a class
of methods such as density ratio (DR) and ILM estimation (ILME) have been
developed, outperforming the classic shallow fusion (SF) method. The basic idea
behind these methods is that RNN-T posterior should first subtract the
implicitly learned ILM prior, in order to integrate the external LM. While
recent studies suggest that RNN-T only learns some low-order language model
information, the DR method uses a well-trained ILM. We hypothesize that this
setting is appropriate and may deteriorate the performance of the DR method,
and propose a low-order density ratio method (LODR) by training a low-order
weak ILM for DR. Extensive empirical experiments are conducted on both
in-domain and cross-domain scenarios on English LibriSpeech & Tedlium-2 and

based on accuracy and F1 score have become the de facto standard to measure the
performance of lane detection methods. While they have played a major role in
improving the performance of lane detection methods, the validity of this
evaluation method in downstream tasks has not been adequately researched. In
this study, we design 2 new driving-oriented metrics for lane detection:
End-to-End Lateral Deviation metric (E2E-LD) is directly formulated based on
the requirements of autonomous driving, a core downstream task of lane
detection; Per-frame Simulated Lateral Deviation metric (PSLD) is a lightweight
surrogate metric of E2E-LD. To evaluate the validity of the metrics, we conduct
a large-scale empirical study with 4 major types of lane detection approaches
on the TuSimple dataset and our newly constructed dataset Comma2k19-LD. Our
results show that the conventional metrics have strongly negative correlations
($\leq$-0.55) with E2E-LD, meaning that some recent improvements purely
targeting the conventional metrics may not have led to meaningful improvements
in autonomous driving, but rather may actually have made it worse by
overfitting to the conventional metrics. As autonomous driving is a
security/safety-critical system, the underestimation of robustness hinders the
sound development of practical lane detection models. We hope that our study
will help the community achieve more downstream task-aware evaluations for lane
detection.]]></summary>

Hankel nuclear norm regularization. Hankel regularization encourages the
low-rankness of the Hankel matrix, which maps to the low-orderness of the
system. We provide novel statistical analysis for this regularization and
carefully contrast it with the unregularized ordinary least-squares (OLS)
estimator. Our analysis leads to new bounds on estimating the impulse response
and the Hankel matrix associated with the linear system. We first design an
input excitation and show that Hankel regularization enables one to recover the
system using optimal number of observations in the true system order and
achieve strong statistical estimation rates. Surprisingly, we demonstrate that
the input design indeed matters, by showing that intuitive choices such as
i.i.d. Gaussian input leads to provably sub-optimal sample complexity. To
better understand the benefits of regularization, we also revisit the OLS
estimator. Besides refining existing bounds, we experimentally identify when
regularized approach improves over OLS: (1) For low-order systems with slow
impulse-response decay, OLS method performs poorly in terms of sample
complexity, (2) Hankel matrix returned by regularization has a more clear
singular value gap that ease identification of the system order, (3) Hankel
regularization is less sensitive to hyperparameter choice. Finally, we
establish model selection guarantees through a joint train-validation procedure
where we tune the regularization parameter for near-optimal estimation.]]></summary>

model-free prediction of the occurrence of extreme events both in time ("when")
and in space ("where") in nonlinear physical systems of spatial dimension two.
The measurements or data are a set of two-dimensional snapshots or images. For
a desired time horizon of prediction, a proper labeling scheme can be
designated to enable successful training of the DCNN and subsequent prediction
of extreme events in time. Given that an extreme event has been predicted to
occur within the time horizon, a space-based labeling scheme can be applied to
predict, within certain resolution, the location at which the event will occur.
We use synthetic data from the 2D complex Ginzburg-Landau equation and
empirical wind speed data of the North Atlantic ocean to demonstrate and
validate our machine-learning based prediction framework. The trade-offs among
the prediction horizon, spatial resolution, and accuracy are illustrated, and
the detrimental effect of spatially biased occurrence of extreme event on
prediction accuracy is discussed. The deep learning framework is viable for

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We introduce HyperMorph, a framework that facilitates efficient
hyperparameter tuning in learning-based deformable image registration.
Classical registration algorithms perform an iterative pair-wise optimization
to compute a deformation field that aligns two images. Recent learning-based
approaches leverage large image datasets to learn a function that rapidly
estimates a deformation for a given image pair. In both strategies, the
accuracy of the resulting spatial correspondences is strongly influenced by the
choice of certain hyperparameter values. However, an effective hyperparameter
search consumes substantial time and human effort as it often involves training
multiple models for different fixed hyperparameter values and may lead to
suboptimal registration. We propose an amortized hyperparameter learning
strategy to alleviate this burden by learning the impact of hyperparameters on
deformation fields. We design a meta network, or hypernetwork, that predicts
the parameters of a registration network for input hyperparameters, thereby
comprising a single model that generates the optimal deformation field
corresponding to given hyperparameter values. This strategy enables fast,
high-resolution hyperparameter search at test-time, reducing the inefficiency
of traditional approaches while increasing flexibility. We also demonstrate
additional benefits of HyperMorph, including enhanced robustness to model
initialization and the ability to rapidly identify optimal hyperparameter
values specific to a dataset, image contrast, task, or even anatomical region,
all without the need to retrain models. We make our code publicly available at

Self-Supervised Audio Spectrogram Transformer (SSAST) model for speech and

a very high masking ratio (75%) during pretraining, meaning that the vast
majority of self-attention compute is performed on mask tokens. We address this
by integrating the encoder-decoder architecture from Masked Autoencoders are
Scalable Vision Learners (MAE) into the SSAST, where a deep encoder operates on
only unmasked input, and a shallow decoder operates on encoder outputs and mask
tokens. We find that MAE-like pretraining can provide a 3x speedup and 2x
memory usage reduction over the vanilla SSAST using current audio pretraining
strategies with ordinary model and input sizes. When fine-tuning on downstream
tasks, which only uses the encoder, we find that our approach outperforms the
SSAST on a variety of downstream tasks. We further conduct comprehensive
evaluations into different strategies of pretraining and explore differences in
MAE-style pretraining between the visual and audio domains.]]></summary>

can be seen as a differentiable version of the argmax function and allows us to
solve the DOA estimation as a regression problem interpreting the output of the
convolutional layers as a probability distribution. We prove that using models
that fit the equivariances of the problem allows us to outperform other

the collaborative training of a global model over decentralized local datasets
without sharing them. It spans a wide scope of applications from
Internet-of-Things (IoT) to biomedical engineering and drug discovery. To
support low-latency and high-privacy FL over wireless networks, in this paper,
we propose a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) empowered over-the-air FL
system to alleviate the dilemma between learning accuracy and privacy. This is
achieved by simultaneously exploiting the channel propagation reconfigurability
with RIS for boosting the receive signal power, as well as waveform
superposition property with over-the-air computation (AirComp) for fast model
aggregation. By considering a practical scenario where high-dimensional local
model updates are transmitted across multiple communication blocks, we
characterize the convergence behaviors of the differentially private federated
optimization algorithm. We further formulate a system optimization problem to
optimize the learning accuracy while satisfying privacy and power constraints
via the joint design of transmit power, artificial noise, and phase shifts at
RIS, for which a two-step alternating minimization framework is developed.
Simulation results validate our systematic, theoretical, and algorithmic
achievements and demonstrate that RIS can achieve a better trade-off between

65536 in MoCo for instance, for which the performance of a dictionary-free
framework is often inferior because the negative sample size (NSS) is limited
by its mini-batch size (MBS). To decouple the NSS from the MBS, a dynamic
dictionary has been adopted in a large volume of CL frameworks, among which
arguably the most popular one is MoCo family. In essence, MoCo adopts a
momentum-based queue dictionary, for which we perform a fine-grained analysis
of its size and consistency. We point out that InfoNCE loss used in MoCo
implicitly attract anchors to their corresponding positive sample with various
strength of penalties and identify such inter-anchor hardness-awareness
property as a major reason for the necessity of a large dictionary. Our
findings motivate us to simplify MoCo v2 via the removal of its dictionary as
well as momentum. Based on an InfoNCE with the proposed dual temperature, our
simplified frameworks, SimMoCo and SimCo, outperform MoCo v2 by a visible
margin. Moreover, our work bridges the gap between CL and non-CL frameworks,
contributing to a more unified understanding of these two mainstream frameworks

to crack in condition monitoring of wind farms. Existing methods focus on
mechanism analysis of icing process, deviation degree analysis of feature
engineering. However, there have not been deep researches of neural networks
applied in this field at present. Supervisory control and data acquisition
(SCADA) makes it possible to train networks through continuously providing not
only operation parameters and performance parameters of wind turbines but also
environmental parameters and operation modes. This paper explores the
possibility that using convolutional neural networks (CNNs), generative
adversarial networks (GANs) and domain adaption learning to establish
intelligent diagnosis frameworks under different training scenarios.
Specifically, PGANC and PGANT are proposed for sufficient and non-sufficient
target wind turbine labeled data, respectively. The basic idea is that we
consider a two-stage training with parallel GANs, which are aimed at capturing
intrinsic features for normal and icing samples, followed by classification CNN
or domain adaption module in various training cases. Model validation on three
wind turbine SCADA data shows that two-stage training can effectively improve
the model performance. Besides, if there is no sufficient labeled data for a
target turbine, which is an extremely common phenomenon in real industrial
practices, the addition of domain adaption learning makes the trained model
show better performance. Overall, our proposed intelligent diagnosis frameworks
can achieve more accurate detection on the same wind turbine and more
generalized capability on a new wind turbine, compared with other machine
learning models and conventional CNNs.]]></summary>

introduce a new convolution operation on regular size feature maps constructed

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Subgraph matching is a fundamental problem in various fields that use graph
structured data. Subgraph matching algorithms enumerate all isomorphic
embeddings of a query graph q in a data graph G. An important branch of
matching algorithms exploit the backtracking search approach which recursively
extends intermediate results following a matching order of query vertices. It
has been shown that the matching order plays a critical role in time efficiency
of these backtracking based subgraph matching algorithms. In recent years, many
advanced techniques for query vertex ordering (i.e., matching order generation)
have been proposed to reduce the unpromising intermediate results according to
the preset heuristic rules. In this paper, for the first time we apply the
Reinforcement Learning (RL) and Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) techniques to
generate the high-quality matching order for subgraph matching algorithms.
Instead of using the fixed heuristics to generate the matching order, our model
could capture and make full use of the graph information, and thus determine
the query vertex order with the adaptive learning-based rule that could
significantly reduces the number of redundant enumerations. With the help of
the reinforcement learning framework, our model is able to consider the
long-term benefits rather than only consider the local information at current
ordering step.Extensive experiments on six real-life data graphs demonstrate
that our proposed matching order generation technique could reduce up to two
orders of magnitude of query processing time compared to the state-of-the-art
algorithms.]]></summary>

alignments is generated to form a lattice for the full-sum training. However,
it is yet largely unknown if these rules are optimal and do lead to the best

different transducer losses, or restricting alignments. We demonstrate that
transducer-based ASR with CTC-like lattice achieves better results compared to
standard RNN-T, while also ensuring a strictly monotonic alignment, which will

optimization, are being explored across experimental sciences as an efficient
alternative to traditional design of experiment. When combined with automated
laboratory hardware and high-performance computing, these strategies enable
next-generation platforms for autonomous experimentation. However, the
practical application of these approaches is hampered by a lack of flexible
software and algorithms tailored to the unique requirements of chemical
research. One such aspect is the pervasive presence of constraints in the
experimental conditions when optimizing chemical processes or protocols, and in
the chemical space that is accessible when designing functional molecules or
materials. Although many of these constraints are known a priori, they can be
interdependent, non-linear, and result in non-compact optimization domains. In
this work, we extend our experiment planning algorithms Phoenics and Gryffin
such that they can handle arbitrary known constraints via an intuitive and
flexible interface. We benchmark these extended algorithms on continuous and
discrete test functions with a diverse set of constraints, demonstrating their
flexibility and robustness. In addition, we illustrate their practical utility
in two simulated chemical research scenarios: the optimization of the synthesis
of o-xylenyl Buckminsterfullerene adducts under constrained flow conditions,
and the design of redox active molecules for flow batteries under synthetic

since even a single failure can lead to costly hardware damage. Most existing
model-free learning methods that guarantee safety, i.e., no failures, during
exploration are limited to local optima. A notable exception is the GoSafe
algorithm, which, unfortunately, cannot handle high-dimensional systems and
hence cannot be applied to most real-world dynamical systems. This work
proposes GoSafeOpt as the first algorithm that can safely discover globally
optimal policies for high-dimensional systems while giving safety and

competing model-free safe learning methods on a robot arm that would be

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Our goal is to recover the 3D shape and pose of dogs from a single image.
This is a challenging task because dogs exhibit a wide range of shapes and
appearances, and are highly articulated. Recent work has proposed to directly
regress the SMAL animal model, with additional limb scale parameters, from
images. Our method, called BARC (Breed-Augmented Regression using
Classification), goes beyond prior work in several important ways. First, we
modify the SMAL shape space to be more appropriate for representing dog shape.
But, even with a better shape model, the problem of regressing dog shape from
an image is still challenging because we lack paired images with 3D ground
truth. To compensate for the lack of paired data, we formulate novel losses
that exploit information about dog breeds. In particular, we exploit the fact
that dogs of the same breed have similar body shapes. We formulate a novel
breed similarity loss consisting of two parts: One term encourages the shape of
dogs from the same breed to be more similar than dogs of different breeds. The
second one, a breed classification loss, helps to produce recognizable
breed-specific shapes. Through ablation studies, we find that our breed losses
significantly improve shape accuracy over a baseline without them. We also
compare BARC qualitatively to WLDO with a perceptual study and find that our
approach produces dogs that are significantly more realistic. This work shows
that a-priori information about genetic similarity can help to compensate for
the lack of 3D training data. This concept may be applicable to other animal
species or groups of species. Our code is publicly available for research
purposes at https://barc.is.tue.mpg.de/.]]></summary>

optimization from the minimization of a single objective to the minimization of
an objective function that depends the solution of another optimization
problem. Recently, stochastic bilevel optimization is regaining popularity in
emerging machine learning applications such as hyper-parameter optimization and
model-agnostic meta learning. To solve this class of stochastic optimization
problems, existing methods require either double-loop or two-timescale updates,
which are sometimes less efficient. This paper develops a new optimization
method for a class of stochastic bilevel problems that we term Single-Timescale
stochAstic BiLevEl optimization (STABLE) method. STABLE runs in a single loop
fashion, and uses a single-timescale update with a fixed batch size. To achieve
an $\epsilon$-stationary point of the bilevel problem, STABLE requires ${\cal
O}(\epsilon^{-2})$ samples in total; and to achieve an $\epsilon$-optimal
solution in the strongly convex case, STABLE requires ${\cal O}(\epsilon^{-1})$
samples. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first bilevel optimization
algorithm achieving the same order of sample complexity as the stochastic
gradient descent method for the single-level stochastic optimization.]]></summary>

due to its compositional property. Most previous works adopt a bottom-up
two-stage or a point-based one-stage approach, which often suffers from high
time complexity or sub-optimal designs. In this work, we propose a novel SGG
method to address the aforementioned issues, formulating the task as a
bipartite graph construction problem. To solve the problem, we develop a
transformer-based end-to-end framework that first generates the entity and
predicate proposal set, followed by inferring directed edges to form the
relation triplets. In particular, we develop a new entity-aware predicate
representation based on a structural predicate generator that leverages the
compositional property of relationships. Moreover, we design a graph assembling
module to infer the connectivity of the bipartite scene graph based on our
entity-aware structure, enabling us to generate the scene graph in an
end-to-end manner. Extensive experimental results show that our design is able
to achieve the state-of-the-art or comparable performance on two challenging
benchmarks, surpassing most of the existing approaches and enjoying higher
efficiency in inference. We hope our model can serve as a strong baseline for
the Transformer-based scene graph generation. Code is available:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) have emerged as the state-of-the-art
graph learning model. However, it can be notoriously challenging to inference
GCNs over large graph datasets, limiting their application to large real-world
graphs and hindering the exploration of deeper and more sophisticated GCN
graphs. This is because real-world graphs can be extremely large and sparse.
Furthermore, the node degree of GCNs tends to follow the power-law distribution
and therefore have highly irregular adjacency matrices, resulting in
prohibitive inefficiencies in both data processing and movement and thus
substantially limiting the achievable GCN acceleration efficiency. To this end,
this paper proposes a GCN algorithm and accelerator Co-Design framework dubbed
GCoD which can largely alleviate the aforementioned GCN irregularity and boost
GCNs' inference efficiency. Specifically, on the algorithm level, GCoD
integrates a split and conquer GCN training strategy that polarizes the graphs
to be either denser or sparser in local neighborhoods without compromising the
model accuracy, resulting in graph adjacency matrices that (mostly) have merely
two levels of workload and enjoys largely enhanced regularity and thus ease of
acceleration. On the hardware level, we further develop a dedicated two-pronged
accelerator with a separated engine to process each of the aforementioned
denser and sparser workloads, further boosting the overall utilization and
acceleration efficiency. Extensive experiments and ablation studies validate
that our GCoD consistently reduces the number of off-chip accesses, leading to
speedups of 15286x, 294x, 7.8x, and 2.5x as compared to CPUs, GPUs, and
prior-art GCN accelerators including HyGCN and AWB-GCN, respectively, while
maintaining or even improving the task accuracy. Codes are available at

encouraging potential to represent complex scenes with neural networks. One
major drawback of NeRF is its prohibitive inference time: Rendering a single
pixel requires querying the NeRF network hundreds of times. To resolve it,
existing efforts mainly attempt to reduce the number of required sampled
points. However, the problem of iterative sampling still exists. On the other
hand, Neural Light Field (NeLF) presents a more straightforward representation
over NeRF in novel view synthesis -- the rendering of a pixel amounts to one
single forward pass without ray-marching. In this work, we present a deep
residual MLP network (88 layers) to effectively learn the light field. We show
the key to successfully learning such a deep NeLF network is to have sufficient
data, for which we transfer the knowledge from a pre-trained NeRF model via
data distillation. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world
scenes show the merits of our method over other counterpart algorithms. On the
synthetic scenes, we achieve 26-35x FLOPs reduction (per camera ray) and 28-31x
runtime speedup, meanwhile delivering significantly better (1.4-2.8 dB average
PSNR improvement) rendering quality than NeRF without any customized
implementation tricks.]]></summary>

we systematically cover approaches to dynamics model learning, including
challenges like dealing with stochasticity, uncertainty, partial observability,
and temporal abstraction. Second, we present a systematic categorization of
planning-learning integration, including aspects like: where to start planning,
what budgets to allocate to planning and real data collection, how to plan, and
how to integrate planning in the learning and acting loop. After these two
sections, we also discuss implicit model-based RL as an end-to-end alternative
for model learning and planning, and we cover the potential benefits of
model-based RL. Along the way, the survey also draws connections to several

approaches may face challenges for discovering repeated geographic patterns

Toeplitz Inverse Covariance-Based Clustering (STICC) method that considers both
attributes and spatial relationships of geographic objects for multivariate
spatial clustering. A subregion is created for each geographic object serving
as the basic unit when performing clustering. A Markov random field is then
constructed to characterize the attribute dependencies of subregions. Using a
spatial consistency strategy, nearby objects are encouraged to belong to the
same cluster. To test the performance of the proposed STICC algorithm, we apply
it in two use cases. The comparison results with several baseline methods show
that the STICC outperforms others significantly in terms of adjusted rand index
and macro-F1 score. Join count statistics is also calculated and shows that the
spatial contiguity is well preserved by STICC. Such a spatial clustering method
may benefit various applications in the fields of geography, remote sensing,

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Solving high-dimensional partial differential equations (PDEs) is a major
challenge in scientific computing. We develop a new numerical method for
solving elliptic-type PDEs by adapting the Q-learning algorithm in
reinforcement learning. Our "Q-PDE" algorithm is mesh-free and therefore has
the potential to overcome the curse of dimensionality. Using a neural tangent
kernel (NTK) approach, we prove that the neural network approximator for the
PDE solution, trained with the Q-PDE algorithm, converges to the trajectory of
an infinite-dimensional ordinary differential equation (ODE) as the number of
hidden units $\rightarrow \infty$. For monotone PDE (i.e. those given by
monotone operators, which may be nonlinear), despite the lack of a spectral gap
in the NTK, we then prove that the limit neural network, which satisfies the
infinite-dimensional ODE, converges in $L^2$ to the PDE solution as the
training time $\rightarrow \infty$. More generally, we can prove that any fixed
point of the wide-network limit for the Q-PDE algorithm is a solution of the
PDE (not necessarily under the monotone condition). The numerical performance
of the Q-PDE algorithm is studied for several elliptic PDEs.]]></summary>

learns new representation of a node by aggregating feature vectors of all

sampling a fixed size set of neighbors, or assigning different weights to
different neighbors in the aggregation process, but features within a feature

introduce a new convolution operation on regular size feature maps constructed
from features of a fixed node bandwidth via sampling to get the first-level

computationally and/or financially expensive. Mono-surrogate Bayesian
optimisation (BO) is a popular model-based approach for optimising such
black-box functions. It combines objective values via scalarisation and builds
a Gaussian process (GP) surrogate of the scalarised values. The location which
maximises a cheap-to-query acquisition function is chosen as the next location
to expensively evaluate. While BO is an effective strategy, the use of GPs is
limiting. Their performance decreases as the problem input dimensionality
increases, and their computational complexity scales cubically with the amount
of data. To address these limitations, we extend previous work on BO by
density-ratio estimation (BORE) to the multi-objective setting. BORE links the
computation of the probability of improvement acquisition function to that of
probabilistic classification. This enables the use of state-of-the-art
classifiers in a BO-like framework. In this work we present MBORE:
multi-objective Bayesian optimisation by density-ratio estimation, and compare
it to BO across a range of synthetic and real-world benchmarks. We find that
MBORE performs as well as or better than BO on a wide variety of problems, and
that it outperforms BO on high-dimensional and real-world problems.]]></summary>

("trajectories") of non-independent covariates, reflecting tasks in sequence
modeling, control, and reinforcement learning. Conceptually, our
multi-trajectory setup sits between two traditional settings in statistical
learning theory: learning from independent examples and learning from a single
auto-correlated sequence. Our conditions for efficient learning generalize the
former setting--trajectories must be non-degenerate in ways that extend
standard requirements for independent examples. They do not require that
trajectories be ergodic, long, nor strictly stable.

For linear least-squares regression, given $n$-dimensional examples produced
by $m$ trajectories, each of length $T$, we observe a notable change in
statistical efficiency as the number of trajectories increases from a few
(namely $m \lesssim n$) to many (namely $m \gtrsim n$). Specifically, we
establish that the worst-case error rate this problem is $\Theta(n / m T)$
whenever $m \gtrsim n$. Meanwhile, when $m \lesssim n$, we establish a (sharp)
lower bound of $\Omega(n^2 / m^2 T)$ on the worst-case error rate, realized by
a simple, marginally unstable linear dynamical system. A key upshot is that, in
domains where trajectories regularly reset, the error rate eventually behaves
as if all of the examples were independent altogether, drawn from their
marginals. As a corollary of our analysis, we also improve guarantees for the
linear system identification problem.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Multi-agent reinforcement learning has made substantial empirical progresses
in solving games with a large number of players. However, theoretically, the
best known sample complexity for finding a Nash equilibrium in general-sum
games scales exponentially in the number of players due to the size of the
joint action space, and there is a matching exponential lower bound. This paper
investigates what learning goals admit better sample complexities in the
setting of $m$-player general-sum Markov games with $H$ steps, $S$ states, and
$A_i$ actions per player. First, we design algorithms for learning an
$\epsilon$-Coarse Correlated Equilibrium (CCE) in
$\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(H^5S\max_{i\le m} A_i / \epsilon^2)$ episodes, and an
$\epsilon$-Correlated Equilibrium (CE) in
$\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(H^6S\max_{i\le m} A_i^2 / \epsilon^2)$ episodes. This
is the first line of results for learning CCE and CE with sample complexities
polynomial in $\max_{i\le m} A_i$. Our algorithm for learning CE integrates an
adversarial bandit subroutine which minimizes a weighted swap regret, along
with several novel designs in the outer loop. Second, we consider the important
special case of Markov Potential Games, and design an algorithm that learns an
$\epsilon$-approximate Nash equilibrium within
$\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(S\sum_{i\le m} A_i / \epsilon^3)$ episodes (when only
highlighting the dependence on $S$, $A_i$, and $\epsilon$), which only depends
linearly in $\sum_{i\le m} A_i$ and significantly improves over existing
efficient algorithm in the $\epsilon$ dependence. Overall, our results shed
light on what equilibria or structural assumptions on the game may enable
sample-efficient learning with many players.]]></summary>

that has found widespread applications. Examples include selecting offers,
prices, advertisements to send to customers, as well as selecting which
medication to prescribe to a patient. However, existing literature rests on the
crucial assumption that the future environment where the learned policy will be
deployed is the same as the past environment that has generated the data -- an
assumption that is often false or too coarse an approximation. In this paper,
we lift this assumption and aim to learn a distributionally robust policy with
incomplete observational data. We first present a policy evaluation procedure
that allows us to assess how well the policy does under the worst-case
environment shift. We then establish a central limit theorem type guarantee for
this proposed policy evaluation scheme. Leveraging this evaluation scheme, we
further propose a novel learning algorithm that is able to learn a policy that
is robust to adversarial perturbations and unknown covariate shifts with a
performance guarantee based on the theory of uniform convergence. Finally, we
empirically test the effectiveness of our proposed algorithm in synthetic
datasets and demonstrate that it provides the robustness that is missing using
standard policy learning algorithms. We conclude the paper by providing a
comprehensive application of our methods in the context of a real-world voting

drawn from a distribution similar to that of the training set. However, DNNs'
predictions are brittle and unreliable when the test samples are drawn from a
dissimilar distribution. This is a major concern for deployment in real-world
applications, where such behavior may come at a considerable cost, such as
industrial production lines, autonomous vehicles, or healthcare applications.
Contributions. We frame Out Of Distribution (OOD) detection in DNNs as a
statistical hypothesis testing problem. Tests generated within our proposed
framework combine evidence from the entire network. Unlike previous OOD
detection heuristics, this framework returns a $p$-value for each test sample.
It is guaranteed to maintain the Type I Error (T1E - incorrectly predicting OOD
for an actual in-distribution sample) for test data. Moreover, this allows to
combine several detectors while maintaining the T1E. Building on this
framework, we suggest a novel OOD procedure based on low-order statistics. Our
method achieves comparable or better results than state-of-the-art methods on
well-accepted OOD benchmarks, without retraining the network parameters or
assuming prior knowledge on the test distribution -- and at a fraction of the
computational cost.]]></summary>

subsets of features. We use group testing to improve the complexity of the
approach. We theoretically prove the correctness of the proposed algorithm to

conditional independence tests are sufficient to identify these variables. A

commonly used for multi-object matching, often involve computation-intensive
and memory-demanding matrix operations. These operations become intractable for
large scale structure-from-motion datasets. For pure permutation
synchronization, the recent Cycle-Edge Message Passing (CEMP) framework
suggests a memory-efficient and fast solution. Here we overcome the restriction
of CEMP to compact groups and propose an improved algorithm, CEMP-Partial, for
estimating the corruption levels of the observed partial permutations. It
allows us to subsequently implement a nonconvex weighted projected power method
without the need of spectral initialization. The resulting new PPS algorithm,
MatchFAME (Fast, Accurate and Memory-Efficient Matching), only involves sparse
matrix operations, and thus enjoys lower time and space complexities in
comparison to previous PPS algorithms. We prove that under adversarial
corruption, though without additive noise and with certain assumptions,
CEMP-Partial is able to exactly classify corrupted and clean partial

user-independent brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) with small data lengths.
Approach: We propose the utilization of filter banks (creating sub-band
components of the EEG signal) in conjunction with DNNs. In this context, we
created three different models: a recurrent neural network (FBRNN) analyzing
the time domain, a 2D convolutional neural network (FBCNN-2D) processing
complex spectrum features and a 3D convolutional neural network (FBCNN-3D)
analyzing complex spectrograms, which we introduce in this study as possible
input for SSVEP classification. We tested our neural networks on three open
datasets and conceived them so as not to require calibration from the final
user, simulating a user-independent BCI. Results: The DNNs with the filter
banks surpassed the accuracy of similar networks without this preprocessing
step by considerable margins, and they outperformed common SSVEP classification
methods (SVM and FBCCA) by even higher margins. Conclusion and significance:
Filter banks allow different types of deep neural networks to more efficiently
analyze the harmonic components of SSVEP. Complex spectrograms carry more
information than complex spectrum features and the magnitude spectrum, allowing
the FBCNN-3D to surpass the other CNNs. The performances obtained in the
challenging classification problems indicates a strong potential for the
construction of portable, economical, fast and low-latency BCIs.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Federated learning (FL) is a promising strategy for performing
privacy-preserving, distributed learning with a network of clients (i.e., edge
devices). However, the data distribution among clients is often non-IID in
nature, making efficient optimization difficult. To alleviate this issue, many
FL algorithms focus on mitigating the effects of data heterogeneity across
clients by introducing a variety of proximal terms, some incurring considerable
compute and/or memory overheads, to restrain local updates with respect to the
global model. Instead, we consider rethinking solutions to data heterogeneity
in FL with a focus on local learning generality rather than proximal
restriction. To this end, we first present a systematic study informed by
second-order indicators to better understand algorithm effectiveness in FL.
Interestingly, we find that standard regularization methods are surprisingly
strong performers in mitigating data heterogeneity effects. Based on our
findings, we further propose a simple and effective method, FedAlign, to
overcome data heterogeneity and the pitfalls of previous methods. FedAlign
achieves competitive accuracy with state-of-the-art FL methods across a variety
of settings while minimizing computation and memory overhead. Code is available

computationally and/or financially expensive. Mono-surrogate Bayesian
optimisation (BO) is a popular model-based approach for optimising such
black-box functions. It combines objective values via scalarisation and builds
a Gaussian process (GP) surrogate of the scalarised values. The location which
maximises a cheap-to-query acquisition function is chosen as the next location
to expensively evaluate. While BO is an effective strategy, the use of GPs is
limiting. Their performance decreases as the problem input dimensionality
increases, and their computational complexity scales cubically with the amount
of data. To address these limitations, we extend previous work on BO by
density-ratio estimation (BORE) to the multi-objective setting. BORE links the
computation of the probability of improvement acquisition function to that of
probabilistic classification. This enables the use of state-of-the-art
classifiers in a BO-like framework. In this work we present MBORE:
multi-objective Bayesian optimisation by density-ratio estimation, and compare
it to BO across a range of synthetic and real-world benchmarks. We find that
MBORE performs as well as or better than BO on a wide variety of problems, and
that it outperforms BO on high-dimensional and real-world problems.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In transportation networks, users typically choose routes in a decentralized
and self-interested manner to minimize their individual travel costs, which, in
practice, often results in inefficient overall outcomes for society. As a
result, there has been a growing interest in designing road tolling schemes to
cope with these efficiency losses and steer users toward a system-efficient
traffic pattern. However, the efficacy of road tolling schemes often relies on
having access to complete information on users' trip attributes, such as their
origin-destination (O-D) travel information and their values of time, which may
not be available in practice.

Motivated by this practical consideration, we propose an online learning
approach to set tolls in a traffic network to drive heterogeneous users with
different values of time toward a system-efficient traffic pattern. In
particular, we develop a simple yet effective algorithm that adjusts tolls at
each time period solely based on the observed aggregate flows on the roads of
the network without relying on any additional trip attributes of users, thereby
preserving user privacy. In the setting where the O-D pairs and values of time
of users are drawn i.i.d. at each period, we show that our approach obtains an
expected regret and road capacity violation of $O(\sqrt{T})$, where $T$ is the
number of periods over which tolls are updated. Our regret guarantee is
relative to an offline oracle that has complete information on users' trip
attributes. We further establish a $\Omega(\sqrt{T})$ lower bound on the regret
of any algorithm, which establishes that our algorithm is optimal up to
constants. Finally, we demonstrate the superior performance of our approach
relative to several benchmarks on a real-world transportation network, thereby
highlighting its practical applicability.]]></summary>

learn the probability density function of data via a sequence of invertible
transformations. Yet, learning attentions in generative flows remains
understudied, while it has made breakthroughs in other domains. To fill the
gap, this paper introduces two types of invertible attention mechanisms, i.e.,
map-based and transformer-based attentions, for both unconditional and
conditional generative flows. The key idea is to exploit a masked scheme of
these two attentions to learn long-range data dependencies in the context of
generative flows. The masked scheme allows for invertible attention modules
with tractable Jacobian determinants, enabling its seamless integration at any
positions of the flow-based models. The proposed attention mechanisms lead to
more efficient generative flows, due to their capability of modeling the
long-term data dependencies. Evaluation on multiple image synthesis tasks shows
that the proposed attention flows result in efficient models and compare
favorably against the state-of-the-art unconditional and conditional generative
flows.]]></summary>

topics in social media and new types of products in e-commerce. A model should
recognize new classes and meanwhile maintain discriminability over old classes.
Under severe circumstances, only limited novel instances are available to
incrementally update the model. The task of recognizing few-shot new classes
without forgetting old classes is called few-shot class-incremental learning
(FSCIL). In this work, we propose a new paradigm for FSCIL based on
meta-learning by LearnIng Multi-phase Incremental Tasks (LIMIT), which
synthesizes fake FSCIL tasks from the base dataset. The data format of fake
tasks is consistent with the `real' incremental tasks, and we can build a
generalizable feature space for the unseen tasks through meta-learning.
Besides, LIMIT also constructs a calibration module based on transformer, which
calibrates the old class classifiers and new class prototypes into the same
scale and fills in the semantic gap. The calibration module also adaptively
contextualizes the instance-specific embedding with a set-to-set function.
LIMIT efficiently adapts to new classes and meanwhile resists forgetting over
old classes. Experiments on three benchmark datasets (CIFAR100, miniImageNet,
and CUB200) and large-scale dataset, i.e., ImageNet ILSVRC2012 validate that
LIMIT achieves state-of-the-art performance.]]></summary>

characteristics of a successful contestant on $\textit{The Bachelor}$. The
three algorithms that we tested were: random forest classification, neural

strategies. While our models were relatively successful, we still encountered
high misclassification rates. This may be because: (1) Our training dataset had

affect cognition, emotion and behaviour with potentially detrimental effects on
health in the case of sustained exposure. Since the affective content of speech
is inherently modulated by an individual's physical and mental state, a
substantial body of research has been devoted to the study of paralinguistic
correlates of stress-inducing task load. Historically, voice stress analysis
(VSA) has been conducted using conventional digital signal processing (DSP)
techniques. Despite the development of modern methods based on deep neural
networks (DNNs), accurately detecting stress in speech remains difficult due to
the wide variety of stressors and considerable variability in the individual
stress perception. To that end, we introduce a set of five datasets for task
load detection in speech. The voice recordings were collected as either

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Many popular contextual bandit algorithms estimate reward models to inform
decision making. However, true rewards can contain action-independent
redundancies that are not relevant for decision making and only increase the
statistical complexity of accurate estimation. It is sufficient and more
data-efficient to estimate the simplest function that explains the reward
differences between actions, that is, the heterogeneous treatment effect,
commonly understood to be more structured and simpler than the reward.
Motivated by this observation, building on recent work on oracle-based
algorithms, we design a statistically optimal and computationally efficient
algorithm using heterogeneous treatment effect estimation oracles. Our results
provide the first universal reduction of contextual bandits to a
general-purpose heterogeneous treatment effect estimation method. We show that
our approach is more robust to model misspecification than reward estimation
methods based on squared error regression oracles. Experimentally, we show the
benefits of heterogeneous treatment effect estimation in contextual bandits
over reward estimation.]]></summary>

Hankel nuclear norm regularization. Hankel regularization encourages the
low-rankness of the Hankel matrix, which maps to the low-orderness of the
system. We provide novel statistical analysis for this regularization and
carefully contrast it with the unregularized ordinary least-squares (OLS)
estimator. Our analysis leads to new bounds on estimating the impulse response
and the Hankel matrix associated with the linear system. We first design an
input excitation and show that Hankel regularization enables one to recover the
system using optimal number of observations in the true system order and
achieve strong statistical estimation rates. Surprisingly, we demonstrate that
the input design indeed matters, by showing that intuitive choices such as
i.i.d. Gaussian input leads to provably sub-optimal sample complexity. To
better understand the benefits of regularization, we also revisit the OLS
estimator. Besides refining existing bounds, we experimentally identify when
regularized approach improves over OLS: (1) For low-order systems with slow
impulse-response decay, OLS method performs poorly in terms of sample
complexity, (2) Hankel matrix returned by regularization has a more clear
singular value gap that ease identification of the system order, (3) Hankel
regularization is less sensitive to hyperparameter choice. Finally, we
establish model selection guarantees through a joint train-validation procedure
where we tune the regularization parameter for near-optimal estimation.]]></summary>

conversation have been introduced over the past couple of years. These include
neural architectures for detecting emotion, dialogue acts, and sentiment
polarity. They take advantage of some of the key attributes of contemporary
machine learning, such as recurrent neural networks with attention mechanisms
and transformer-based approaches. However, while the architectures themselves
are extremely promising, the phenomena they have been applied to to date are
but a small part of what makes conversation engaging. In this paper we survey
these neural architectures and what they have been applied to. On the basis of
the social science literature, we then describe what we believe to be the most
fundamental and definitional feature of conversation, which is its
co-construction over time by two or more interlocutors. We discuss how neural
architectures of the sort surveyed could profitably be applied to these more
fundamental aspects of conversation, and what this buys us in terms of a better
analysis of conversation and even, in the longer term, a better way of

capacity in representing complex and high-order relationships. However, current

this paper, we show both theoretically and empirically, that the performance of
hypergraph neural networks does not improve as the number of layers increases,
which is known as the over-smoothing problem. To tackle this issue, we develop
a new deep hypergraph convolutional network called Deep-HGCN, which can
maintain the heterogeneity of node representation in deep layers. Specifically,
we prove that a $k$-layer Deep-HGCN simulates a polynomial filter of order $k$
with arbitrary coefficients, which can relieve the problem of over-smoothing.
Experimental results on various datasets demonstrate the superior performance
of the proposed model comparing to the state-of-the-art hypergraph learning
approaches.]]></summary>

as this guides the investigator to the inner workings and main function of
ransomware itself. By utilizing access privileges in process memory, the main
function of the ransomware can be detected more easily and accurately.
Furthermore, new signatures and fingerprints of ransomware families can be
identified to classify novel ransomware attacks correctly. The current research
used the process memory access privileges of the different memory regions of
the behavior of an executable to quickly determine its intent before serious
harm can occur. To achieve this aim, several well-known machine learning

these rare events may have high impact in certain scenarios. Based on the large

minimizer of the rate function upon paths that connect two points. One of the
challenges to calculate the most likely transition path for stochastic
dynamical systems under non-Gaussian L\'evy noise is that the associated rate

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In neural text-to-speech (TTS), two-stage system or a cascade of separately
learned models have shown synthesis quality close to human speech. For example,
FastSpeech2 transforms an input text to a mel-spectrogram and then HiFi-GAN
generates a raw waveform from a mel-spectogram where they are called an
acoustic feature generator and a neural vocoder respectively. However, their
training pipeline is somewhat cumbersome in that it requires a fine-tuning and
an accurate speech-text alignment for optimal performance. In this work, we
present end-to-end text-to-speech (E2E-TTS) model which has a simplified
training pipeline and outperforms a cascade of separately learned models.
Specifically, our proposed model is jointly trained FastSpeech2 and HiFi-GAN
with an alignment module. Since there is no acoustic feature mismatch between
training and inference, it does not requires fine-tuning. Furthermore, we
remove dependency on an external speech-text alignment tool by adopting an
alignment learning objective in our joint training framework. Experiments on
LJSpeech corpus shows that the proposed model outperforms publicly available,
state-of-the-art implementations of ESPNet2-TTS on subjective evaluation (MOS)
and some objective evaluations.]]></summary>

uncertainty sets which are known to be hard to solve even if the underlying
deterministic problem is easy. Popular solution methods iteratively generate
scenario constraints and possibly second-stage variables. This way, by solving
a sequence of smaller problems, it is often possible to avoid the complexity of
considering all scenarios simultaneously. A key ingredient for the performance
of the iterative methods is a good selection of start scenarios. In this paper
we propose a data-driven heuristic to seed the iterative solution method with a
set of starting scenarios that provide a strong lower bound early in the
process, and result in considerably smaller overall solution times compared to
other benchmark methods. Our heuristic learns the relevance of a scenario by
extracting information from training data based on a combined similarity
measure between robust problem instances and single scenarios. Our experiments
show that predicting even a small number of good start scenarios by our method
can considerably reduce the computation time of the iterative methods.]]></summary>

algorithms are near linear time computable in the sample size. We specifically
focus on the performance of these online algorithms in the context of
estimating piecewise polynomial and bounded variation function classes in the

privacy issues when using a trained model for question answering. We introduce
Relational Memorization (RM) to understand, quantify and control this

the performance of a trained model, bounding RM does not prevent effective
learning. The difference is most pronounced when the data distribution is
long-tailed, with many queries having only few training examples: Impeding
general memorization prevents effective learning, while impeding only
relational memorization still allows learning general properties of the
underlying concepts. We formalize the notion of Relational Privacy (RP) and,
inspired by Differential Privacy (DP), we provide a possible definition of

in addressing the challenge of climate change. One of the drawbacks of
wind-generated energy is the large space necessary to install a wind farm; this
arises from the fact that placing wind turbines in a limited area would hinder
their productivity and therefore not be economically convenient. This naturally
leads to an optimisation problem, which has three specific challenges: (1)
multiple conflicting objectives (2) computationally expensive simulation models
and (3) optimisation over design sets instead of design vectors. The first and
second challenges can be addressed by using surrogate-assisted e.g.\ Bayesian
multi-objective optimisation. However, the traditional Bayesian optimisation
cannot be applied as the optimisation function in the problem relies on design
sets instead of design vectors. This paper extends the applicability of
Bayesian multi-objective optimisation to set based optimisation for solving the
wind farm layout problem. We use a set-based kernel in Gaussian process to
quantify the correlation between wind farms (with a different number of
turbines). The results on the given data set of wind energy and direction
clearly show the potential of using set-based Bayesian multi-objective
optimisation.]]></summary>

are scarce, we propose a novel estimator of the out-of-sample performance of a
policy in data-driven optimization.Our approach exploits the optimization
problem's sensitivity analysis to estimate the gradient of the optimal
objective value with respect to the amount of noise in the data and uses the
estimated gradient to debias the policy's in-sample performance. Unlike
cross-validation techniques, our approach avoids sacrificing data for a test
set, utilizes all data when training and, hence, is well-suited to settings
where data are scarce. We prove bounds on the bias and variance of our
estimator for optimization problems with uncertain linear objectives but known,
potentially non-convex, feasible regions. For more specialized optimization
problems where the feasible region is "weakly-coupled" in a certain sense, we
prove stronger results. Specifically, we provide explicit high-probability
bounds on the error of our estimator that hold uniformly over a policy class
and depends on the problem's dimension and policy class's complexity. Our
bounds show that under mild conditions, the error of our estimator vanishes as
the dimension of the optimization problem grows, even if the amount of
available data remains small and constant. Said differently, we prove our
estimator performs well in the small-data, large-scale regime. Finally, we
numerically compare our proposed method to state-of-the-art approaches through
a case-study on dispatching emergency medical response services using real

that has found widespread applications. Examples include selecting offers,
prices, advertisements to send to customers, as well as selecting which
medication to prescribe to a patient. However, existing literature rests on the
crucial assumption that the future environment where the learned policy will be
deployed is the same as the past environment that has generated the data -- an
assumption that is often false or too coarse an approximation. In this paper,
we lift this assumption and aim to learn a distributionally robust policy with
incomplete observational data. We first present a policy evaluation procedure
that allows us to assess how well the policy does under the worst-case
environment shift. We then establish a central limit theorem type guarantee for
this proposed policy evaluation scheme. Leveraging this evaluation scheme, we
further propose a novel learning algorithm that is able to learn a policy that
is robust to adversarial perturbations and unknown covariate shifts with a
performance guarantee based on the theory of uniform convergence. Finally, we
empirically test the effectiveness of our proposed algorithm in synthetic
datasets and demonstrate that it provides the robustness that is missing using
standard policy learning algorithms. We conclude the paper by providing a

representing high-dimensional distributions with structure. Recent years have
also seen big advances in designing multi-item mechanisms. Akin to overfitting,
however, these mechanisms can be extremely sensitive to the Bayesian prior that
they target, which becomes problematic when that prior is only approximately
known. At the same time, even if access to the exact Bayesian prior is given,
it is known that optimal or even approximately optimal multi-item mechanisms
run into sample, computational, representation and communication intractability
barriers.

We consider a natural class of multi-item mechanism design problems with very
large numbers of items, but where the bidders' value distributions can be
well-approximated by a topic model akin to those used in recommendation systems
with very large numbers of possible recommendations. We propose a mechanism
design framework for this setting, building on a recent robustification
framework by Brustle et al., which disentangles the statistical challenge of
estimating a multi-dimensional prior from the task of designing a good
mechanism for it, and robustifies the performance of the latter against the
estimation error of the former. We provide an extension of this framework
appropriate for our setting, which allows us to exploit the expressive power of
topic models to reduce the effective dimensionality of the mechanism design
problem and remove the dependence of its computational, communication and
representation complexity on the number of items.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The calibration of solid constitutive models with full-field experimental
data is a long-standing challenge, especially in materials which undergo large
deformation. In this paper, we propose a physics-informed deep-learning
framework for the discovery of constitutive model parameterizations given
full-field displacement data and global force-displacement data. Contrary to
the majority of recent literature in this field, we work with the weak form of
the governing equations rather than the strong form to impose physical
constraints upon the neural network predictions. The approach presented in this
paper is computationally efficient, suitable for irregular geometric domains,
and readily ingests displacement data without the need for interpolation onto a
computational grid. A selection of canonical hyperelastic materials models
suitable for different material classes is considered including the
Neo-Hookean, Gent, and Blatz-Ko constitutive models as exemplars for general
hyperelastic behavior, polymer behavior with lock-up, and compressible foam
behavior respectively. We demonstrate that physics informed machine learning is
an enabling technology and may shift the paradigm of how full-field
experimental data is utilized to calibrate constitutive models under finite
deformations.]]></summary>

bi-level optimization. However, the existing gradient-based bi-level
optimization algorithms cannot handle nonconvex or nonsmooth regularizers, and
they suffer from a high computation complexity in nonconvex bi-level
optimization. In this work, we study a proximal gradient-type algorithm that
adopts the approximate implicit differentiation (AID) scheme for nonconvex
bi-level optimization with possibly nonconvex and nonsmooth regularizers. In
particular, the algorithm applies the Nesterov's momentum to accelerate the
computation of the implicit gradient involved in AID. We provide a
comprehensive analysis of the global convergence properties of this algorithm
through identifying its intrinsic potential function. In particular, we
formally establish the convergence of the model parameters to a critical point
of the bi-level problem, and obtain an improved computation complexity
$\mathcal{O}(\kappa^{3.5}\epsilon^{-2})$ over the state-of-the-art result.
Moreover, we analyze the asymptotic convergence rates of this algorithm under a
class of local nonconvex geometries characterized by a {\L}ojasiewicz-type
gradient inequality. Experiment on hyper-parameter optimization demonstrates
the effectiveness of our algorithm.]]></summary>

privacy issues when using a trained model for question answering. We introduce
Relational Memorization (RM) to understand, quantify and control this

the performance of a trained model, bounding RM does not prevent effective
learning. The difference is most pronounced when the data distribution is
long-tailed, with many queries having only few training examples: Impeding
general memorization prevents effective learning, while impeding only
relational memorization still allows learning general properties of the
underlying concepts. We formalize the notion of Relational Privacy (RP) and,
inspired by Differential Privacy (DP), we provide a possible definition of
Differential Relational Privacy (DrP). These notions can be used to describe

decision making. However, true rewards can contain action-independent
redundancies that are not relevant for decision making and only increase the
statistical complexity of accurate estimation. It is sufficient and more
data-efficient to estimate the simplest function that explains the reward
differences between actions, that is, the heterogeneous treatment effect,
commonly understood to be more structured and simpler than the reward.
Motivated by this observation, building on recent work on oracle-based
algorithms, we design a statistically optimal and computationally efficient
algorithm using heterogeneous treatment effect estimation oracles. Our results
provide the first universal reduction of contextual bandits to a
general-purpose heterogeneous treatment effect estimation method. We show that
our approach is more robust to model misspecification than reward estimation
methods based on squared error regression oracles. Experimentally, we show the

by the generalized quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA). However,
the hybrid discrete-continuous optimization problem in the generalized QAOA
poses a challenge to the optimization. We propose a new algorithm called
MCTS-QAOA, which combines a Monte Carlo tree search method with an improved

We lay the ground for such research by evaluating on various architectures a
representative set of adversarial attacks: targeted and untargeted,
optimization and speech processing-based, white-box, black-box and targeted
attacks. Our results show that the relative strengths of different attack
algorithms vary considerably when changing the model architecture, and that the
results of some attacks are not to be blindly trusted. They also indicate that
training choices such as self-supervised pretraining can significantly impact
robustness by enabling transferable perturbations. We release our source code

parallel in time approaches. For effective parallelization of DD-DA algorithms,
the computational load assigned to subdomains must be equally distributed.
Usually computational cost is proportional to the amount of data entities
assigned to partitions. Good quality partitioning also requires the volume of
communication during calculation to be kept at its minimum. In order to deal
with DD-DA problems where the observations are nonuniformly distributed and
general sparse, in the present work we employ a parallel load balancing
algorithm based on adaptive and dynamic defining of boundaries of DD -- which
is aimed to balance workload according to data location. We call it DyDD. As
the numerical model underlying DA problems arising from the so-called

critical for predicting and explaining observed properties. Binary population
synthesis with full stellar-structure and evolution simulations are
computationally expensive requiring a large number of mass-transfer sequences.
The recently developed binary population synthesis code POSYDON incorporates
grids of MESA binary star simulations which are then interpolated to model
large-scale populations of massive binaries. The traditional method of
computing a high-density rectilinear grid of simulations is not scalable for
higher-dimension grids, accounting for a range of metallicities, rotation, and
eccentricity. We present a new active learning algorithm, psy-cris, which uses
machine learning in the data-gathering process to adaptively and iteratively
select targeted simulations to run, resulting in a custom, high-performance
training set. We test psy-cris on a toy problem and find the resulting training
sets require fewer simulations for accurate classification and regression than
either regular or randomly sampled grids. We further apply psy-cris to the
target problem of building a dynamic grid of MESA simulations, and we
demonstrate that, even without fine tuning, a simulation set of only $\sim 1/4$
the size of a rectilinear grid is sufficient to achieve the same classification
accuracy. We anticipate further gains when algorithmic parameters are optimized
for the targeted application. We find that optimizing for classification only
may lead to performance losses in regression, and vice versa. Lowering the
computational cost of producing grids will enable future versions of POSYDON to

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Modern smart sensor-based energy management systems leverage non-intrusive
load monitoring (NILM) to predict and optimize appliance load distribution in
real-time. NILM, or energy disaggregation, refers to the decomposition of
electricity usage conditioned on the aggregated power signals (i.e., smart
sensor on the main channel). Based on real-time appliance power prediction
using sensory technology, energy disaggregation has great potential to increase
electricity efficiency and reduce energy expenditure. With the introduction of
transformer models, NILM has achieved significant improvements in predicting
device power readings. Nevertheless, transformers are less efficient due to
O(l^2) complexity w.r.t. sequence length l. Moreover, transformers can fail to
capture local signal patterns in sequence-to-point settings due to the lack of
inductive bias in local context. In this work, we propose an efficient
localness transformer for non-intrusive load monitoring (ELTransformer).
Specifically, we leverage normalization functions and switch the order of
matrix multiplication to approximate self-attention and reduce computational
complexity. Additionally, we introduce localness modeling with sparse local
attention heads and relative position encodings to enhance the model capacity
in extracting short-term local patterns. To the best of our knowledge,
ELTransformer is the first NILM model that addresses computational complexity
and localness modeling in NILM. With extensive experiments and quantitative
analyses, we demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of the the proposed
ELTransformer with considerable improvements compared to state-of-the-art
baselines.]]></summary>

key component to extract representations from consecutive and partially
overlapping segments in a long speech session. To be more consistent with the
back-end segmentation and clustering, we propose a new CNN-based speaker
modeling scheme, which takes into account the heterogeneity of the speakers in
each training segment and batch. We randomly and synthetically augment the
training data into a set of segments, each of which contains more than one
speaker and some overlapping parts. A soft label is imposed on each segment
based on its speaker occupation ratio, and the standard cross entropy loss is
implemented in model training. In this way, the speaker model should have the
ability to generate a geometrically meaningful embedding for each multi-speaker
segment. Experimental results show that our system is superior to the baseline
system using x-vectors in two speaker diarization tasks. In the CALLHOME task
trained on the NIST SRE and Switchboard datasets, our system achieves a
relative reduction of 12.93% in DER. In Track 2 of CHiME-6, our system provides
13.24%, 12.60%, and 5.65% relative reductions in DER, JER, and WER,

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Continually learning new classes from fresh data without forgetting previous
knowledge of old classes is a very challenging research problem. Moreover, it
is imperative that such learning must respect certain memory and computational
constraints such as (i) training samples are limited to only a few per class,
(ii) the computational cost of learning a novel class remains constant, and
(iii) the memory footprint of the model grows at most linearly with the number
of classes observed. To meet the above constraints, we propose C-FSCIL, which
is architecturally composed of a frozen meta-learned feature extractor, a
trainable fixed-size fully connected layer, and a rewritable dynamically
growing memory that stores as many vectors as the number of encountered
classes. C-FSCIL provides three update modes that offer a trade-off between
accuracy and compute-memory cost of learning novel classes. C-FSCIL exploits
hyperdimensional embedding that allows to continually express many more classes
than the fixed dimensions in the vector space, with minimal interference. The
quality of class vector representations is further improved by aligning them
quasi-orthogonally to each other by means of novel loss functions. Experiments
on the CIFAR100, miniImageNet, and Omniglot datasets show that C-FSCIL
outperforms the baselines with remarkable accuracy and compression. It also
scales up to the largest problem size ever tried in this few-shot setting by
learning 423 novel classes on top of 1200 base classes with less than 1.6%
accuracy drop. Our code is available at

downstream applications, such as answering questions by reasoning about unseen

as colors and shapes, as axis-aligned boxes in a high-dimensional space (the
"box embedding space"). Given an input image and its paired sentence, our model
first resolves the referential expression in the sentence and associates the
novel concept with particular objects in the scene. Next, our model interprets
supplemental sentences to relate the novel concept with other known concepts,
such as "X has property Y" or "X is a kind of Y". Finally, it infers an optimal
box embedding for the novel concept that jointly 1) maximizes the likelihood of
the observed instances in the image, and 2) satisfies the relationships between
the novel concepts and the known ones. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our

Identifying whether or not the residents of the house are present, is important

The majority of published papers focus on either pressure / door sensors or
cameras in order to detect outing events. Although the aforementioned
approaches provide solid results, they are intrusive and require modifications
for sensor placement. In our work, appliance electrical use is investigated as
a means for detecting the presence or absence of residents. The energy use is
the result of power disaggregation, a non intrusive / non invasive sensing
method. Since a dataset providing energy data and ground truth for home absence
is not available, artificial outing events were introduced on the UK-DALE

machine learning algorithms were evaluated using the generated dataset.

 Assume you have a simulation or access to an environment. There are certain parameters you can set to control the performance of a system which lives in this simulation/environment. Naturally, one wants to find the optimal parameters or optimal policy to set the parameter that can result the most reward, however that is defined. 
 For example, in the stock market, I may want to find the optimal market price to buy and sell, or the optimal policy. In a car driving game, I may want to determine the optimal policy to set speed and direction.

 I am trying to add padding to images in Pytorch - I need to standardize all the images in my dataset to be of the same size. I spent the whole day trying to find a good solution but nothing worked. I succeeded in resizing but that compromised my image quality, so that is why I want to proceed with padding. How to do this?
 Thanks in advance! :)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi everyone,
 For quite a long time, I have seen folks looking for a way to do SSO (Single Sign-On) for CVAT, a popular labeling tool. But unfortunately such capability is not readily available. It only supports local authentication and LDAP.
 So we decided to make a change proactively, and now we are in the process of enabling SSO for it. The initial result looks promising. Check it out to see what we have done: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7hBBLG5Fdc
 Is this something that you would love to have?
 Any other machine learning tools that you want to have SSO capability as well?
 Any feedback are welcome.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Pretraining of BERT-type large language models, which may scale up to billions of parameters, is essential to achieving best-in-class performance on various natural language processing (NLP) applications. However, the pretraining procedure is costly, and it has become a hurdle for the industrial deployment of big language models.
 In a research paper, researchers from Google, New York University, and the University of Maryland recommend a simple but effective “token dropping” method that drastically reduces the pretraining cost of transformer models like BERT while maintaining downstream fine-tuning performance.
 Token dropping is a technique for speeding up the pretraining of transformer models like BERT without sacrificing their performance on downstream tasks. Starting with an intermediate layer in the model, they eliminate uninteresting tokens to let the model focus on key tokens more effectively, given its limited computing resources. The model’s last layer then picks up the dropped tokens, producing full-length sequences. They use the built-in masked language modeling (MLM) loss and its dynamics to detect non-essential tokens with little computing complexity. According to their tests, this straightforward strategy decreases BERT’s pretraining cost by 25% while yielding somewhat higher overall fine-tuning performance on conventional downstream tasks.

 Exploration is one of the oldest challenges for Reinforcement Learning algorithms, with no clear solution to date. Especially in environments with sparse rewards, agents face significant challenges in deciding which parts of the environment to explore further. Providing intrinsic motivation in form of a pseudo-reward is sometimes used to overcome this challenge, but often relies on hand-crafted heuristics, and can lead to deceptive dead-ends. This paper proposes to use language descriptions of encountered states as a method of assessing novelty. In two procedurally generated environments, they demonstrate the usefulness of language, which is in itself highly concise and abstractive, which lends itself well for this task.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Benchmarks are an important way to measure progress in AI research – but artificial intelligence is constantly achieving new bests. Are we running out of AI benchmarks? 
 ...
 Researchers at the Medical University of Vienna and the University of Oxford now show in a meta-study of AI benchmarks that saturated or stagnant benchmarks are common. The researchers examined 1,688 benchmarks with 406 tasks in computer vision and natural language processing since 2013, and draw the following conclusions:
  
In some cases, there would be continuous growth, such as in the ImageNet benchmark.
 However, a majority of all benchmarks quickly reach technological stagnation or saturation.
 In some cases, a lack of research interest is also a cause of stagnation. The researchers cite the UCF101 action recognition benchmark as an example of saturation.
 However, the dynamics of performance improvement do not follow a clearly discernible pattern: in some cases, phases of stagnation are followed by unpredictable leaps. This is what happened in the PROTEINS benchmark.
  
...
 Moreover, of the 1,688 benchmarks, only 66 percent have more than three results at different points in time – so in practice, 33 percent of all AI benchmarks are not used and therefore useless. 
 ...
 In the future, new benchmarks should be developed by large, collaborative teams from many institutions, knowledge domains, and cultures to ensure high-quality benchmarks and avoid fragmentation of the benchmark landscape, the researchers conclude.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Integrating machine learning capabilities to MySQL systems is prohibitively difficult and time-consuming. The process involves extracting data from the database and into another system to construct and deploy machine learning models. As data flows around, this strategy produces silos for applying machine learning to application data and causes latency. This results in data leakage, making the database more open to security attacks. Moreover, existing machine learning (ML) solutions lack the ability to explain why the model developers build delivers specific predictions.
 Recently, Oracle released MySQL HeatWave, the only MySQL cloud database service that supports in-database machine learning (ML). It automates the ML lifecycle and saves all trained models in the MySQL database, removing the need to migrate data or models to a machine learning tool or service. This decreases application complexity, saves costs, and increases data and model security. It produces a model with the best algorithm, features, and hyper-parameters for a specific data collection and application.

Automatic translation of speech from one language to speech in another language, called speech-to-speech translation (S2ST), is important for breaking down the communication barriers between people speaking different languages. Conventionally, automatic S2ST systems are built with a cascade of automatic speech recognition (ASR), text-to-text machine translation (MT), and text-to-speech (TTS) synthesis sub-systems, so that the system overall is text-centric. Recently, work on S2ST that doesn’t rely on intermediate text representation is emerging, such as end-to-end direct S2ST (e.g., Translatotron) and cascade S2ST based on learned discrete representations of speech (e.g., Tjandra et al.).

 This is my first time trying reinforcement learning and Unity and wanted some help. 
 I am trying to train a quadcopter to hover and keep a stationary ball in its camera frame using just visual inputs by a camera sensor. So the input to the network would be an 84*84 grayscale image and the output would be the four forces to the rotor.
 My reward function is 
 ​
 Reward Function
 where x and y is the position of the drone and a is the rotation of the drone with respect to the target. I have set A, d and c to 3 and lambda as 1/180. I have also added a condition where if the quadcopter drops below a certain height from the platform, it punishes it by a reward of -1 and resets the episode.
 The network I am using is the ppop network used by the coin-collector example in mlagents. 
 My training log is below: 
 Training log
 The cumulative reward and episode length just drops after a while and the value loss explodes. I think something maybe wrong with my rewards or network. 
 If anyone has any ideas what might be going wrong and tell me, that would be great.

 This seems to be a relatively "standard" task for creating cross-lingual datasets, so I hope someone has some tips, and I do not need to spend the next week reinventing the wheel :)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi everyone,
 I want to run a feedforward autoregressive network to forecast the potential sales of specific SKUs for the following months. The idea is to capture the non-linearity in the data. Does it make sense to use ReLU? or given that all my data points are positive values this function will return the same number (max(0,x)), therefore is not suitable for what I am trying to do?
 I have also checked other activation functions, but sigmoid for example is for classification, and hyperbolic tangent returns values that can be negative.
 ​
 Any help would be much appreciated
 Thanks!

 We designed it as a drop-in replacement for ReLU, and we would love to hear what you think.
 The code is up on GitHub, and the preprint should be up soon, too: https://github.com/rasbt/cyclemoid-pytorch
 PS: Currently, we only have a PyTorch implementation but would welcome it if someone could port it to TensorFlow/Keras (my Tf/Keras skills are just too rusty for it.)

 I'm trying a different approach, where instead of searching for data sources, and then integrating manually, you just upload your dataset. My service has a large index with datasets and api providers, and finds relevant ones for your dataset which you can add easily.
 ​
 example search via sdk
 Does this seem useful to you? Would love to hear your thoughts

 - comma.ai self-driving system.
 - Weather nowcasting
 - Tokamak fision reactor feeedback control
 - Hardware design: New gen. TPU
 - Datacenter cooling optimization
 - Adaptive locomotion for quadrupedal robots *
 - Portfolio optimization (financial instruments)
 There is a lot of work in games, particularly board games, but these do not really solve something "useful" for society. I have seen also lots of toy examples with libraries like gym and some robotics but in general these are rather proof-of-concept models or just models that do not work at all. One that actually does work is Solving Rubik’s Cube with a Robot Hand, not regarding the solution of the cube but its dexterous manipulation with a robotic hand. This is pretty cool, but again, the domain of the problem is too narrow to be considered actually a successful application to a real-world problem. So my question is, am I missing some examples? For example, is any company out there trying to apply deep RL to self-driving vehicles or to NLP, and have they had any success?
 * Boston dynamics solves this without ML, just good'ol control theory so this is a 50-50 win for RL.
 ​
 Edit: Thanks everyone for the responses, I have updated the list with more projects from the comments.
 Edit 2: Took Alphafold out because the current version (2.x) does not use RL.

Chatbots will be armed with Conversational AI - and powered by an in-depth understanding of the client and their past behaviors - will be able to offer the service which is most likely to suit each client.
 Retailers can take advantage of the ability to engage potential customers through virtual attendants. Along with this opportunity is a growing range of new and exciting ways to utilize chatbots within retail spaces. A lack of customer engagement through mobile messaging costs retailers around $1 trillion annually, as customers are increasingly becoming reluctant to contact mainstream outlets for recommendations due to their negative experiences, or because they have already made up their mind on what they want.
 This can be potentially overcome by utilizing Chatbots; in-store systems powered by AI that can be utilized across multiple channels, including the outlet's website and branded social media profiles.

 1) I collect prob while running simulation. When optimizing, I use same neural network to sample another action and its prob, this new and its probability becomes my new_policy and then I optimize for L_clip function. 
 2) I collect prob while running simulation. Before optimizing the ppo objective, I first run a simple policy gradient by using the original prob I collected. After updating the NN, I once more get new_prob which I use in L_clip function.
 Can someone please tell me which should I do and why?

 The thing is that I want to study text-to-image synthesis; but I see that there are lots of work already done up until now. I am kind of confused about how I should start studying.
 About my experience, I am trying to learn as much as I can. I started by following Andrew Ng’s Machine Learning course on Coursera; and now I continue with Deep Learning Specialization (almost finished). Apart from these, I check NVIDIA blog, some YouTube channels, Slack communities and of course here on Reddit along with a few other channels. As I said, I am trying to follow what’s going on. 
 To tell the truth, I didn’t do much in terms of building models. I mean, not a real-life project or something like that. My experience is more based on projects for the courses that I attend/attended. By the way, I don’t know how it will affect things’ turning out; but I have recently begun a graduate program as well in artificial intelligence. Moreover, during my undergraduate program, I took some courses that might help (at least I guess so) including Calculus and Linear Algebra.
 I also want to mention that as for hardware there is an NVIDIA Jetson Nano Developer Kit available to me.
 I hope that what I am asking is clear and information I provided help you answering. If not, please ask me.
 Best regards.

 Do you have experience with data pipeline tools/frameworks and data validation tools/frameworks?
 For example I just found "Great Expectations" and "Kedro", "Flyte" and I was wondering at which point in time and project complexity should we choose one of these tools instead of the ancient cave man way?

 I need to fix the seeds for reproducibility but no matter what i have tried I cannot achieve it.
 The implementation uses multithreading on cpu and plays on the oepnai gym cartpole or atari environments.
 I believe that it has something to do with multithreading but im not sure.

In experimental work, surprise can take the form of not knowing how the experiment will turn out.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi Folks,
 I'm in a bit of a dilemma here on a specific fine grained classification problem that we have. The task at hand is to classify the subspecies of plant seeds. Firstly, the seeds are super tiny, but we have camera setup to take zoomed images of the seeds. Secondly, even the experts can't tell the exact difference between 2 subspecies of seeds. They go by their experience and intuition. All the subspecies put together looks similar but the data points within the same subspecies are vastly different. The requirement being classifying the subspecies based on their morphological properties. Here is the catch, the requirement is 98%+ accuracy. I tried few preprocessing and models (transformers, resnets, inception and other sort) but can't hit the 98% accuracy mark. Even if I could, the model sometimes fail on external sets or on production.
 I would like some expert (ML side) take on this issue on how to approach this.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, Reddit!
 Excited to share with you guys, Nix-TTS 🐤! Our latest research in lightweight neural Text-to-Speech.
 We've seen how synthetic voices generated by recent neural TTS are getting more and more natural, but most of the time the models suffer from slow CPU inference and are not end-to-end, which requires an additional vocoder model.
 Nix-TTS 🐤 is an incredibly lightweight end-to-end TTS model achieved by applying non end-to-end knowledge distillation to a powerful yet large-sized generative TTS teacher model.
 Our proposed model is end-to-end (vocoder-free) with only 5.23M parameters or up to 82% reduction of the teacher model. We also employed a stochastic duration predictor to improve its expressiveness.
 It is capable to run 10x faster than real-time on Intel i7 CPU and 0.5 times faster than real-time on Raspberry Pi Model 3B. Making it suitable for deployment in resource-constrained settings. Here we attached the complexity and speedup detail from the paper.

 If you could change/significantly improve one thing about building ML systems, what would it be? Some examples could be:
  
Reducing the computational overhead
 Reducing or eliminating the need for large datasets
 Simplifying the process of constructing models
  
However, it’s not limited to just those three.
 Curious to see where this goes!

We can get multimodal data(texts, images, and audio) and we want to do this: collect negative and positive pairs from each user's swiping history and do a binary classification (matching). Then we would get together as many users' data as possible and train a model.
 Though it sounds nice, this is hard as we could not find an existing developer tool or paper that supports combining such rich multimodal data. Any existing research out there to achieve this task? Moreover, is there already any library or AutoML tool that supports this? Checked Google AutoML, does not support this.
 Any help and advice would be much appreciated.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi r/MachineLearning,
 https://github.com/jacobgil/pytorch-grad-cam is a project that has a comprehensive collection of Pixel Attribution Methods for PyTorch (like the package name grad-cam that was the original algorithm implemented).
 Typically pixel attribution methods are adapted for classification: they let you understand what part of the image correspond to a certain classification category.
 However some deep learning models output embeddings instead of category scores.You can then match these embeddings against other embeddings and measure their similarity. For example: in face recognition models, or in self supervised networks.
 In this case to apply pixel attribution, we could create embeddings of concepts, and then for new query images we would be asking: "what parts of the image have feature representations that match the concept features?"
 Or in other words: "where in the query image do we see the concepts?"
 ​
 I wrote a tutorial that shows how to use the pytorch-grad-cam project, to adapt pixel attribution for the embedding case, and visualize where different concept feature representations match the image:
 https://github.com/jacobgil/pytorch-grad-cam/blob/master/tutorials/Pixel%20Attribution%20for%20embeddings.ipynb
 An example is the image below. The two left images are "concept" images of clouds, and a car.
 Then given a new query image, we can try to see where in the image do we feature representations that match these concepts.
 Given images of concepts and a query image, attribute what parts of the query image match the concepts
 I hope someone finds this useful !

 What data-centric techniques can you use to resolve it? Could some form of cropping augmentation do the trick?Classic example is ruler beside melanoma, while there may be a correlation between presence of ruler and presence of melanoma you don't want to the model to depend on that information because it may not exist 'in production'. Below is a quotation describing another similar problem.
 "In another paper a similar issue was found because doctors sometimes use purple markers to highlight potentially-malignant skin cancers for easier examination. Some argue that the purple marks are a real signal that should be incorporated in the model just as the visual appearance of the tumor itself is incorporated. However, if your goal is robust generalizability over time it is probably best to not have your AI incorporate the human applied purple marks as signal, as the standards for applying those marks may vary across teams and across time." https://menloml.com/2020/01/11/recognizing-a-ruler-instead-of-a-cancer/

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Paper: https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.05483
 TL;DR; from LeCun: Recurrent nets in which the weight matrix is unitary are interesting beasts: they are invertible, they don't suffer from vanishing/exploding gradient, and they perform computation akin to what happens in quantum computers. training them can be difficult or expensive. We propose a low-rank (low-cost) update method to update unitary weight matrices with gradient descent.
 Abstract: In learning with recurrent or very deep feed-forward networks, employing unitary matrices in each layer can be very effective at maintaining long-range stability. However, restricting network parameters to be unitary typically comes at the cost of expensive parameterizations or increased training runtime. We propose instead an efficient method based on rank-k updates -- or their rank-k approximation -- that maintains performance at a nearly optimal training runtime. We introduce two variants of this method, named Direct (projUNN-D) and Tangent (projUNN-T) projected Unitary Neural Networks, that can parameterize full N-dimensional unitary or orthogonal matrices with a training runtime scaling as O(kN^2). Our method either projects low-rank gradients onto the closest unitary matrix (projUNN-T) or transports unitary matrices in the direction of the low-rank gradient (projUNN-D). Even in the fastest setting (k=1), projUNN is able to train a model's unitary parameters to reach comparable performances against baseline implementations. By integrating our projUNN algorithm into both recurrent and convolutional neural networks, our models can closely match or exceed benchmarked results from state-of-the-art algorithms.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Multi-object tracking aims to locate and track all objects in a video feed. It’s a fundamental component in domains like mobile robots, where an autonomous system must navigate dynamic surroundings populated by other mobile agents. Thanks to breakthroughs in deep learning and object detection, tracking-by-detection has become the dominant tracking paradigm in recent years.
 Tracking-by-detection simplifies the process by reducing it to just two steps: detection and association. First, an object detector searches each video stream frame for probable items. The second phase is an association step, which connects detections over time. Local trackers are greedy when it comes to pairwise relationships. They keep track of each trajectory’s state based on its position and/or identity traits and correlate current-frame detections with it based on its last visible status.

But when it comes to document classification, in terms of using embeddings for a downstream classification task, would that be considered tabular data? You will end up with data that fits in a table that you wish to classify...it's high dimensional but you could reduce dimensions until you end up with just a smaller set of columns and the labels. 
 I guess I'm unclear about what defines tabular data in this context, and if it makes sense to use a different model (like XBGboost) for the classification task, vs having it as a final layer in the embedding network.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm having a doubt that may be a little stupid, but I ask to be sure.
 Assume that in my environment rewards are delayed by a random number n of steps, i.e. the agent takes an action but receives the reward n steps after taking that action. At every step a reward is produced, therefore the reward r_t in transitions s_t, a_t, r_t, s_{t+1} collected by the agent is actually the reward corresponding to the transition at time t-n. 
 An example scenario: the RL agent control a transportation network, and a reward is generated only when a package reach its destination. Thus, the reward arrives with possibly several steps of delay with respect to when the relevant actions were taken. 
 Now, I know that delayed rewards are not generally an issue, e.g. all those settings in which there is only one reward +1 at the end, but I am wondering if this case is equivalent. What makes me wonder is that here, for a state s_t onwards to state s_{t+n}, there are n rewards in the middle that depend on states previous to s_t. 
 Does this make the problem non-markovian? How can one learn the value function V(s_t) if its estimation is always affected by unrelated rewards r_{t-n} ... r_{t-1}?

 Abstract: A fundamental goal of scientific research is to learn about causal relationships. However, despite its critical role in the life and social sciences, causality has not had the same importance in Natural Language Processing (NLP), which has traditionally placed more emphasis on predictive tasks. This distinction is beginning to fade, with an emerging area of interdisciplinary research at the convergence of causal inference and language processing. Still, research on causality in NLP remains scattered across domains without unified definitions, benchmark datasets and clear articulations of the remaining challenges. In this survey, we consolidate research across academic areas and situate it in the broader NLP landscape. We introduce the statistical challenge of estimating causal effects, encompassing settings where text is used as an outcome, treatment, or as a means to address confounding. In addition, we explore potential uses of causal inference to improve the performance, robustness, fairness, and interpretability of NLP models. We thus provide a unified overview of causal inference for the computational linguistics community.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Working on a group project for college, utilizing a AIY Vision kit and implementing some variation of machine learning with it. The initial idea was to use the camera to identify playing cards and sorting them into groups, like different suits, odd/even, face and non face, but after meeting with the professor in charge, was informed that this idea of identifying and sorting is not really marketable. I tried explaining that sorting in the different ways could be used in many different applications and businesses, but still was told it was not really marketable. I was wondering if maybe there was a way to tweak it a bit to make it so, or if maybe turning it into an API would help. Any ideas and/or opinions on the project would be very helpful. Thank you very much.
 I understand this may fall under beginner related questions and project, but was curious to know if my group and I are on a right track or not, as we haven’t had any sort of guidance up to date.

 In China, the state and companies are researching AI models with trillions of parameters. They want to prove that they can develop “brain-scale” AI.
 In the race to build ever-larger AI models, China is showing that cooperation between the state, universities and the private sector holds the potential for gigantic AI models. The researchers are talking about “brain-scale” AI: according to their definition, these are AI models with parameters beyond the 100-trillion mark.
 ...
 In a new paper, researchers from Tsinghua University, Alibaba Group, Zhejiang Lab and Beijing Academy of Artificial Intelligence present BaGuaLu, a framework that enables the training of large AI models using the Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture.
 ...
 In an initial test, the researchers trained a 1.93 trillion model with their framework, outperforming Google’s Switch Transformer. They also demonstrate that their framework enables models with 14.5 trillion and a full 174 trillion parameters.
 ...
 BaGuaLu could soon be used to train the first models beyond 100 trillion parameters.

 This might be a quite specific question but im not sure where else to go and ask. I'm currently an intern and charged with implementing and comparing different active learning algorithms to see which work best for our specific usecase. Since the coreset approach ( [1708.00489] Active Learning for Convolutional Neural Networks: A Core-Set Approach (arxiv.org) ) is now around for a long time, one of the best documented and shows promising results in a variety of papers I implemented it and ran some experiments with it. The results were a bit dissappointing. It got even outperformed by the random baseline .... To understand the bad performance I dug a bit deeper since I spend a significant amount of time implementing it. What I made out now as the issue is using the l_2 norm of penultimate layer as the metric. This leads to an oversampling of data samples with a certain softmax output due to the way the softmax function behaves. Has someone experienced the same issues? The only point where I could see coreset to be of some use is with a dataset that has a ton of redundant/similar images.
 Thank's a lot

 During the project implementation for my bachelor's thesis [1], a software (named dike, as the Greek goddess of justice) capable of analyzing malicious programs using artificial intelligence techniques, I was unable to locate an open source dataset with labeled malware samples in the public domain. As a result, I created DikeDataset, a dataset with labeled PE and OLE samples [2]. Because it was not the main focus of my thesis, the samples attributes are not evenly distributed (the benign-malicious and OLE-PE ratios are quite low), but the dataset aided greatly in the research process.
 This week, I was surprised to see that the public GitHub repository (which was used only for storage, without any promotion on communities like this) gained some organic reach (views, clones and stars). Furthermore, I was thrilled to learn that it was used in a research article published in 2021 [3]!
 As a result, I'd like to share this project with the community in the hopes that it will be useful to some members of the community.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi Everyone,
 Some time ago, we had the idea to start building tools to facilitate 3D computer vision development. We started by looking at some of the 3D tools out there and realized that there wasn't anything that fit our needs or could be extended to do some of the things we wanted to do. 
 We started working on a tool to annotate point clouds with different label types (bounding box, rectangles, keypoints) to use as a base for our projects. We recently open sourced the tool, which you can find here: https://github.com/StrayRobots/3d-annotation-tool
 In the future we might add more tools, for example to paint point clouds or a polygon label type. 
 We would love to hear your feedback on the tool. Has anyone here built any 3D vision datasets? What kind of tools did you use?

 My Background:
 I work as a web dev for almost 2 years. Before that when I was studying in college, I thought ML is the only field which was in demand. I put my 100% into it but the professor was so bad that not only me but a lot of my peers found ML,DS to be very difficult. We were able to built project around but never tried to learn more. 
 I tired many udemy or coursea courses but never found it engaging. 
 Is it just me or did you also found ML difficult? Is my approach to learning it wrong? If anyone has any advice I'd really appreciate it

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm currently working on a project related to multimodal summarization using transformers.
 My input is a image and long text and output will be a summary of the text pertaining to the image.
 ​
 For extracting image features, I'm using pretrained resnet model. It gives me a [49 * 2048] vector for an image.
 For extracting paragraph features, I'm getting embeddings for each sentence, so the data_dimension will be [no_of_sentences * 512]
 ​
 I need to attend to both these set of features and generate output. I have gone through tutorials to understand the working of transformers but couldn't understand how to combine these into a single input so that the encoder can attend over both image and the paragraph together at the same time.
 ​
 Any pointers to tutorials will be very helpful.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Yesterday, an anonymous open letter and accompanying Financial Times (paywall) article were published accusing DeepMind of mishandling allegations of sexual abuse by a senior member of the research team. 
 The FT article (reported on here in Fortune) goes on to suggest that the mishandling may have been deliberate in order to exploit legal loopholes in the UK where victims have a limited amount of time to take a case to employment tribunal. 
 This comes shortly after Mustafa Suleyman, one of the cofounders was quietly shuffled out to Google (he has subsequently left and founded a new startup with another DeepMind alum) after he was found to have bullied and humiliated staff for years.
 Google itself also has a poor record when it comes to sexual harassment, bullying and retaliation at the highest levels resulting in payouts of hundreds of millions of dollars. 
 Given that DeepMind and Google have a pretty strong grip on the development of AI in terms of employing many of the key people across many of the various subfields, having access to unparalleled data and compute and pushing forward more and more into health (for example the DeepMind offshoot Isomorphic Labs which itself is headed by Demis and staffed by DeepMinders, and the various Google healthcare bets and projects), can we really trust them to be stewards of fair and responsible AI development? 
 Bad things happen in all large organizations. But DeepMind isn’t that big and in the past five years, DeepMind leadership have presided over a steady stream of sexual harassment, bullying and other scandals and handled them all extremely poorly and showed little signs that things have changed. This points to something rotten in the culture and leadership there and at it’s parent organization.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Surveillance cameras have an identity crisis exacerbated by a conflict between function and privacy. Machine learning techniques have automated video content analysis on a vast scale as these sophisticated small sensors have shown up seemingly everywhere. Still, with increased mass monitoring, there are currently no legally enforceable standards to curb privacy invasions.
 Security cameras have evolved into wiser and more capable tools than the grainy images of the past, which were frequently used as the “hero tool” in crime dramas. Video surveillance can now assist health regulators in determining the percentage of persons using masks, transportation departments in monitoring the density and flow of automobiles, cyclists and walkers, and businesses in gaining a better understanding of buying habits. But why has privacy remained a second-class citizen?
 Privid
 Currently, the footage is retrofitted with blurred faces or black boxes. This prevents analysts from asking some legitimate questions (for example, are people wearing masks? ). Dissatisfied with the present status quo, MIT’s Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL) developed a system with other institutions to better guarantee privacy in surveillance video footage. The system, dubbed “Privid,” allows analysts to input video data searches and then adds a tiny amount of noise (additional data) to the result to ensure that no one can be identified. The method is based on a formal notion of privacy known as “differential privacy,” which permits without having access to aggregate statistics about private data disclosing individually identifying information.

One oddity I have noticed when training a few models is that a model with a lower MPJPE then some methods does not alwayshave a higher PCK (higher is better for this metric) but the mean joint precsion error is substantially below the threshold used for PCK (I do recognize that this metric is an average).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Today Google had a webinar on Tensorflow Quantum for big data, which I attended. I was surprised that it was almost all quantum computing theory, but there was a link in the talk resources to Tensorflow Quantum where I was told I could find a tutorial with demo code for a classifier system to compare it to my classical approaches -- I use logistic regression, support vector machine, and Tensorflow DNN classifiers; mostly SVM because it works almost as accurately on my job's data sets as DNNs but takes a tiny fraction of the time to train.
 So, I took a look at it: https://www.tensorflow.org/quantum/tutorials/mnist
 This was the first sign that quantum classification might not be a viable alternative:
  
An image size of 28x28 is much too large for current quantum computers.
 -- https://www.tensorflow.org/quantum/tutorials/mnist#12_downscale_the_images
  
You really have to see it to believe it, but this demo requires downscaling legible digits for handwriting recognition to 4-by-4 pixel completely indiscernible blobs! Resulting in, as you might expect, terrible accuracy. A classical model using the full resolution images achieves 99.9%+ accuracy in relatively almost no time to train.
 So I scrolled down to the "Comparison" section and saw this:
  
a classical model of similar power (~32 parameters) trains to a similar accuracy in a fraction of the time. One way or the other, the classical neural network easily outperforms the quantum neural network. For classical data, it is difficult to beat a classical neural network.
  
The remainder of the tutorial didn't offer any improvement. The "quantum convolutional" NN classifier wasn't any better in speed or accuracy.
  
So, am I correct in assuming that I am best off ignoring quantum computing for classification tasks for the foreseeable future?
 How long do you think it will be until quantum ML can compete on real-world problems?

 after testing a bit I found it helps training if you modify how many N steps you reset epsilon as you train, e.g. I start on 3k for 100k frames and then 10k for 100k frames and then no resetting.
 I can't be the first and I understand there are much more mathematically stronger exploration techniques but is this a poorman's exploration technique?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Training datasets are very important for experimenting with varied data to train new AI models. However, many commonly used public data sets contain labeling errors. This makes it challenging to train robust models, particularly for novel tasks. Many researchers use techniques such as employing a variety of data quality control procedures to overcome these shortcomings. However, there is no centralized repository consisting of examples of using these strategies.
 Meta AI researchers have recently released Mephisto. It is a new platform to collect, share, and iterate on the most promising approaches to collecting training datasets for AI models. Researchers can exchange unique collecting strategies with Mephisto in a reusable and iterable format. It also allows them to change out components and quickly locate the exact annotations required, minimizing the barrier to custom task creation.

It is a new approach to synchronize two or more entities with another. Instead of relying on a central clock which the other ones communicate with, this technology is mutually or naturally synchronized, so both entities know at any time what the other one is doing.
 My question would be, are there any possible application fields you could think of for this technology?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello All,
 I am currently working on the project wherein I have to apply DL to CFD simulations. The simulation data is basically a set of 2d points (x,y) and their corresponding velocity and pressure values. I have such data for a 100 timesteps. The goal is to predict the flow(i.e. velocity and pressure) for each grid point for the last time step. I was thinking of reshaping the data in the form of a square so that I can use a CNN, but using a CNN wouldn't take care of the time dependence between the data. Is there a hybrid approach I can use that can take care of both temporal and spatial dependencies?
 ​
 Really need some guidance. Even any unrelated advice would be much appreciated. Thank you in advance!
 ​
 Edit: Also needed some help with regards to making the dataset. I have 100 csv files, each file corresponding to one time step. Each file contains the pressure and velocities of around 900 points. How do I make a dataset out of this either in pytorch or tensorflow?

 This is meant to be a drop in replacement for torch.Conv. It should be performant on kernel sizes above 20, depending on implementation. 
 One interesting thing, even if a person already had one of these, is the way the bias and bias gradient were calculated. It only cost O(out_channels), ignoring the data size entirely.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Pretty much as the title says. I work in research with electroencephalography (EEG) classification (those electrodes they stick on peoples heads). EEG is notoriously noisy and prone to overfitting, I have generally used validation accuracy as an optimization metric for a Bayesian HP tuning approach, but I find this tends to result in fairly unreliable models, even using cross validation approaches. These models are really noisy and while they may reach pretty good accuracy, that is a single epoch where it got a decent spike. I was wondering if there are common resolutions for this that I have missed, or if anyone has had luck with a custom metric that takes into account not just the validation accuracy, but the consistency and the difference between validation and training accuracy to better account for overfitting.

 Recently I'm on research about neural architecture search. While reading through tons of papers about neural architecture search, I just got curious about 'how do we predefine primitive operations?' Because most of the paper goes like 'we have these ops in candidates, and we searched through candidates so elegantly...' I mean, how do we know we've predefined our candidates well? Is there any reference to 'good ops candidates'? I know certain cells and ops are often used in certain tasks, but still, I want to find a robust reference about 'The ops candidates for NAS'.
 It will cure my high blood pressure if you guys give your precious opinions about it.

These could be reports, reviews, briefs, policies, etc. Nowadays, readers wish to have a concise summary including major elements of their document, helping them prioritize their work efficiently. However, writing a document summary from scratch manually is a time-consuming task.
 To aid document writers in writing content summaries, Google announced a new feature enabling Google Docs to generate ideas automatically when they are available. The team employs a machine learning (ML) model to understand document text and provide a one- to two-sentence natural language description of the material. On the other hand, the document writer retains complete control, choosing whether to accept the proposal as-is, make necessary adjustments to better capture the document summary, or ignore it entirely. This section, combined with the outline, can help readers understand and navigate the work at a high level. While anybody can contribute summaries, only Google Workspace business customers have access to auto-generated ideas.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I had an idea recently for a ML regression strategy and I'm just wondering if something like this already exists. It has similarities with both boosting and bagging, but I think it's ultimately different from both.
 The basic idea is that you start with a subset of input features and train a model on that subset. Any common model will do as long as it doesn't just spit out the exact target value when making a prediction on the training set (i.e., you couldn't use a 1-neighbor KNN). After fitting the model, you make predictions on the training set (with the same subset of features) and calculate the prediction errors.
 Then using another subset of features (I would think it should be mutually exclusive from the first subset but maybe it doesn't have to be), you train a separate model, but rather than training on the original Y training data, you use the error of the previous model as the target for the second model.
 You repeat this process until all features have been used or as many times as desired. To make a prediction, the parent model would simply sum the predictions of the child models.
 As an additional thought, you might use more regularization, larger leaf size for decision trees, etc. for each additional model. You could also use bagging to create multiple instances of the strategy with different feature subsets in order to create multiple "pathways" through the data.
 A few questions:
  
Is this sufficiently different from existing boosting/bagging techniques?
 If yes to #1, are there any existing packages (preferably in Python) that implement this kind of technique?
 Could this be used to reduce overfitting for higher dimensional datasets? If so, would additional steps need to be taken (e.g., like the iterative regularization scheme I mentioned)? My thought is that it's a kind of divide-and-conquer strategy where each subsequent model is asked to do a little less than the previous model.
  
Any thoughts are appreciated.

 Abstract: Representation learning constructs low-dimensional representations to summarize essential features of high-dimensional data. This learning problem is often approached by describing various desiderata associated with learned representations; e.g., that they be non-spurious, efficient, or disentangled. It can be challenging, however, to turn these intuitive desiderata into formal criteria that can be measured and enhanced based on observed data. In this paper, we take a causal perspective on representation learning, formalizing non-spuriousness and efficiency (in supervised representation learning) and disentanglement (in unsupervised representation learning) using counterfactual quantities and observable consequences of causal assertions. This yields computable metrics that can be used to assess the degree to which representations satisfy the desiderata of interest and learn non-spurious and disentangled representations from single observational datasets.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I was hoping I could get some insight into the tooling that you use (or would use) for some production RL work? I'm mostly doing it all on my home machine as a fun side project. 
 I've got the following existing infrastructure: 
 - An interface based loosely on the standard RL setup. I'm thinking about adapting it to fit Acme to let it do more heavy lifting since I quite like `Haiku`, `rlax` and the rest of what they do.
 - I've got some models across languages (Pytorch and Jax) and this has been causing me some headache trying to make sure everything is abstract enough. Should I just stick to one language and make sure all my friends just use that same language? 
 - I'm currently using comet-ml for my experiment tracking, and for the most part I like it. However, I'm now looking around to see what's out there and I'm a little overwhelmed by (1) how many tools there are and (2) how some of them seem to "overlap" so I don't really know how to compose them.
 - configs all stored in a python file in a separate repo that is kept synced between my other repos.
 - I currently store my agent experiences (off policy) in a database that I later query to rapidly fill up the replay buffer. The limitation is that this is for a single agent. What drew me to Acme is that it seems to allow multiple agents to all use the same buffer? 
 _____________
 tl;dr
 1) Has anyone used Acme? I'm thinking of moving my project to it, but it might end up being a lot of effort for very little reward
 2) How do you and your teams handle multiple languages? Do you just have abstract gym wrappers that convert data? 
 3) What tools do you use and how do you compose them together? I'm so so lost trying to navigate this space
 4) How do you keep your configs synced when they are used between repos?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Flower is an end-to-end federated learning framework that allows for a smoother transition from simulation-based experimental research to system research on many real-world edge devices. Flower has individual strengths in both domains (i.e., simulation and real-world devices) and the capacity to switch back and forth between the two extremes as needed throughout exploration and development. Researchers present use cases that drive our viewpoint, design goals, the resultant framework architecture, and comparisons to other frameworks in this part.
 Federated Learning (FL) has shown to be a viable option for enabling edge devices to develop a shared prediction model cooperatively while maintaining their training data on the device, divorcing the capacity to execute machine learning from the requirement to store data in the cloud. However, FL is challenging to implement practically in size and system heterogeneity. Although there are several research frameworks for simulating FL algorithms, none of them facilitate the investigation of scalable FL workloads on heterogeneous edge devices.
 Flower 0.18 released
 Thanks to a longer gap than usual, the latest Flower release has more upgrades than any previous release. Also, thanks to the wonderful community for your continuing support and generosity.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, I'm trying to run QAT on a MobileNetV2 based model but having some issues hitting the same training losses in the QAT phase as I did in the not-QAT phase.
 As a test, I'd trained the network for 1 epoch, then trained the QAT phase for 5 epochs and managed to get the same loss (actually lower). However, after training the model (non-QAT part) for 150 epochs, the QAT phase is really struggling to get down to the same loss.
 In my first test it dropped then completely levelled off for 2-3 epochs then nosedived again for another epoch, I'm not seeing the same in this longer train though.
 I was wondering if anyone has any advice on things like, should the learning rate be reset at the start of the QAT phase or should it carry on from where the training left off? I'm using Adam as the optimiser in the first phase, is that still ok in the second phase. Any other things that I could try? I did read a paper on improving quantization loss in MobileNet by L2 weighting the separable conv weights and swapping out ReLU6 for ReLU but I wasn't really seeing the same benefit as the paper (https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.08607.pdf) did in my tests, I was getting a worse initial network.
 Thanks for any insight that anyone can provide!

 I'm going through research to figure out how the Date Inference protocols might be implemented. Given a text containing the phrase "5 days from now", I would need it to infer the date April 3rd. The 'now' part is a trivial problem, but the inference is something I'm struggling with. I could use regex but all the possible edge cases are tricky. 
 The inference would need to work on unstructured cases like "April 23rd", "Next Sunday", etc. It would need to work forwards and backward (5 days ago etc.)
 ​
 Any great papers/resources? I searched for date inference, but nothing similar to what I'm looking for

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm a researcher who is deeply interested in deep generative models. There are excellent textbooks I want to read if time allows, such as:
 Probabilistic ML: https://probml.github.io/pml-book/book1.html
 PRML: https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/uploads/prod/2006/01/Bishop-Pattern-Recognition-and-Machine-Learning-2006.pdf
 However, there are also many papers I have to read, new theories I have to learn, and works I need to finish. The problem is that reading textbooks could deepen the fundamental understanding of the field but rarely gives an immediate reward. Practically, reading a textbook from start to end can take > 1000 hours, in which one can read more than a hundred papers. Given the situation, I have studied basic stuff only when I need them for my research (you know, publish or perish).
 ​
 However, I think the time to read textbooks will decrease rather than increase, and only junior researchers will be able to afford to read them. It means that if I don't read them now, I won't be able to read later. Is there any general advice on this?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have a project featuring 5+ years of data detailing mechanic reports. Essentially, I want to use ML to build a model that can make suggested actions to fix an issue based on these mechanic reports. For example, if a user typed in that a car “makes a squeaky sound” then it suggests three courses of action that may fix the issue based on similar issues and solutions detailed in the mechanic reports. 
 Furthermore, when returning these suggestions, I want the user to see some sort of score indicating how likely it is to fix the issue (i.e. option A worked 97% of the time, option B 2% of the time, and option C 1% of the time). I also want the user to be able to try the options and give feedback on if they fixed the issue. 
 My brain immediately went to a recommender system, but I don’t have much experience with creating them. Can they do all of the above (recommend solutions, score solutions, and allow for user input to keep training the model) or do I need to somehow pair with another method/model? I’m just not sure where to start.

Machine learning, in simple terms, is a sort of artificial intelligence (AI) that lets software applications improve their accuracy at predicting events without having to be explicitly programmed to do so. Machine learning algorithms use past data as input to forecast new output values.
 The world changed with the introduction of vaccinations, revisions to mask regulations, and new COVID variations in 2021. Accordingly, their Maps community updated Google Maps with further information about their nearby areas. Their contributions have helped Google provide updated company information, such as a location’s hours of operation or its health and safety regulations, for 30% more firms in 2021 than 2020.

 For iterative pruning algorithms referring to research papers like:
 ​
  
Learning both Weights and Connections for Efficient Neural Networks
 Deep Compression
 Comparing Rewinding and Fine-Tuning in Neural Network Pruning
  
I have found that during these pruning rounds, the pruned sub-network starts to overfit excessively, with training accuracy approaching almost 100%. This can be attributed to the fact that the surviving trained parameters are not reinitialized to either the randomly initialized values or to a previous value from earlier in the training.
 Whereas, for "The Lottery Ticket Hypothesis" and it's family of related research papers such as:
  
The Lottery Ticket Hypothesis
 Stabilizing the Lottery Ticket Hypothesis
 One ticket to win them all
 Deconstructing Lottery Tickets
  
such overfitting is usually not observed due to the weight rewinding scheme.
 Since, the original & unpruned deep learning architecture is already trained with strategies such as: data augmentation, weight decay, learning rate schedule, etc., the resulting iterative pruning rounds result in overfitting.
 Can you suggest a way to avoid these overfitting during these iterative pruning rounds?

 In industry (e.g., wind power, automotive), gearboxes often operate under random speed variations. A condition monitoring system is expected to detect faults, broken tooth conditions and assess their severity using vibration signals collected under different speed profiles.
 Modern cars have hundreds of thousands of details and systems where it is necessary to predict breakdowns, control the state of temperature, pressure, etc.As such, in the automotive industry, it is critically important t…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi,
 I'm a student at the University of Glasgow building a linux app that is trying to use CNNs to teach people the ASL (american sign language) alphabet. We just released the first version of our software which (although admittedly buggy) is worth sharing with interested communities. In brief, a MobileNetv2 model is trained on kaggle data for each sign in the ASL alphabet, this is executed within the OpenCV framework and run on camera frames of the user in real time. The user is challenged to make different signs and rewarded when the correct sign is made. We would love for interested people to try out our software and let us know about enhancement ideas or any bugs they may find.
 If you are interested in the project, please head over to our GitHub to have a look:

 ​
 ​
 i am an EE student, i am currently taking a class (my first) in machine learning, also i am enjoying it so much, now we have reached the point where we are studying neural networks.. back propgation, CNN, RNN, Autoencoders, Deep Learning etc..
 ​
 and my prof wants us to get working with some projects (using neural network)
 ​
 basically he wants us to get some already written code in Gethub (((written with Pytorch))) and understand it, understand the task, the motivation, the structure and the math, and modify it if needed, and implement it, and this will be the project, no one starts from scratch
 ​
 for example:
 image classification
 object detection
 ​
 also he said that the code that identify numbers is simple for a project, it will be an assignment.
 ​
 so any ideas?
 or links
 or any advice in general
 ​
 thanks guys and all the best

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi everyone. Our DS & DA team open sourced a Python library that helps in dealing with categorical variables for machine learning algorithms.
 It leverages Tensorflow/Keras embedding layers and builds a neural network that learns a dense representation of each unique class. This is all packaged inside a regular scikit-learn transformer that can be used within pipelines and can have its hyperparameters optimized with regular sklearn methods.
 Just do pip install embedding-encoder[tf]. Check out the readme at Github or the blog post for examples.
 Github: https://github.com/cpa-analytics/embedding-encoder
 PyPI: https://pypi.org/project/embedding-encoder/
 Blog post: https://cpa-analytics.github.io/embedding-encoder-intro/
 This was inspired by the 3rd place solution in the Rossmann Store Sales Kaggle competition. Some implementations have surfaced over the years but we are not aware of working one that integrates well with existing libraries.
 This is just another preprocessing technique. It can be optimal for your task or not. As always, try multiple approaches and evaluate the results!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey everyone!
 I'd like to use a large language model like T0pp or GPT-NeoX-20B to take a natural-language input from a user and map it to one of ~2000 possible VS Code command palette commands. Essentially, this is a classification problem of the form "NLP input -> command".
 The idea is to let users give voice input in natural language and then have the model figure out what command they most likely want to activate.
 Given the number of possible commands I clearly can't rely on prompt design to solve this. It might be a good fit for a model with explicit retrieval augmentation like a memorizing transformer. But that's still a very active area of research without high-quality pre-trained models.
 Given that, I'm thinking that doing some kind of fine tuning to an existing model is the best bet. But it's unclear to me what the training data should look like... should I just generate a few examples of each command of the form input: "vscode command: 'open new file'", output: "explorer.newFile", and then fine-tune on those? Is there some way to ensure that the model understands that I *always* want it to return one of the commands provided in fine-tuning, instead of arbitrary text?
 Interested in others' experiences with similar tasks! 
 Background: I'm working on an open source VS Code extension called Clippy AI. Currently it only performs code modifications to the current file and is a thin wrapper around the OpenAI API. But I'd like to use it to automate other editor actions as well!

And when I plotted the data, it had no clear trend. This pitcher for the graph looks like my dataset here! dataset (sorry I cannot share the dataset because of privacy). So, I started to take the difference in the data to remove the seasonality and log transformation and after that, I bullied the model using the Arima algorithm and LSTM, and prophet. And I applied a prediction interval for the predicted number to get periods and expect the number will be inside this interval. But unfortunately, the actual number (for this month) was out of the interval. So, I decided to look back in a database and I found a feature I think that may help and have a high correlation with the main feature now becoming a multivariate time series problem. so, I tried to use the VAR algorithm but unfortunately, the model also filed and the actual number for each feature was out of interval. This first time for me to build a time series model in the industry for a real dataset and I worked alone. So, there is an approach that can help me to build a better model that I do not follow in my step. Or I should go to my boss tell him cannot build a model for this dataset, especially the data is impacted by a coronavirus.

 I am a german student and currently writing my masters thesis. It is a rather simple ML task but for my thesis I need to describe the methodology and which process models are used and I am new to this. I found CRISP-DM and its successor ASUM-DM. However, I know that sounds stupid, I am not able to find information on these or useful pdfs. Like the general information and descriptions are accessable but I need an officisl source that I can cite. IBM itself has a link: ftp: //ftp.software.ibm.com/software/data/ sw-library/services/ASUM.pdf However, its not working for me as I have no ftp access. 
 So my question is, does anyone have a link where I can find relevant official information to these models and furthermore are there any other standards or process models to describe the approach of working with data that are rather used in the industry.

 From the article:
 In China, the state and companies are researching AI models with trillions of parameters. They want to prove that they can develop “brain-scale” AI.
 ...
 In a new paper, researchers from Tsinghua University, Alibaba Group, Zhejiang Lab and Beijing Academy of Artificial Intelligence present BaGuaLu, a framework that enables the training of large AI models using the Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture.
 In an initial test, the researchers trained a 1.93 trillion model with their framework, outperforming Google’s Switch Transformer. They also demonstrate that their framework enables models with 14.5 trillion and a full 174 trillion parameters.
 ...
 The team expects that giant multimodal AI models could have far-reaching implications for numerous AI applications.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am currently build a PPO agent for OpenAI gym's Pong environment using Pytorch and I had a question:
 So typically the workflow is:
  
Use the state as the input for a CNN and output the action probabilities
 Sample the action distribution for an action and perform env.step(action) with it
 Obtain there rewards and calculate some reward / loss function such as log probs*rewards
 Backpropogate this loss/reward using reward/loss.backward() and optimizer.step()
  
Now, Pytorch's loss.backward() and optimizer.step() only calculates and updates gradients for pyTorch Variable objects where requires_grad=True.
 So how does Pytorch backpropogate through env.step() ? env.step() outputs numpy arrays (if you're using a parallel environment) or integers (not tensors)...
 Secondly, if I try to convert a Tensor output to a numpy array to input to env.step() - say an array of actions for parallel environments, it breaks my backpropogation right?
 Thirdly, does that mean that env.step() is a differentiable function?
 Thanks in advance!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Google researchers created JAX to conduct NumPy computations on GPUs and TPUs. DeepMind uses it to help and expedite its research, and it is increasingly gaining popularity. Differentiation with grad(), vectorization with map(), and JIT-compilation (just-in-time) with jit are some of the composable functions required for machine learning research in JAX (). As a result, adding a JAX-based workload to the Flower code samples is a must-have. The combination of JAX and Flower allows ML and FL researchers to employ the deep learning framework that their projects demand. The updated code example now serves as a template for migrating existing JAX projects to a federated environment.
 It’s pretty simple to put up a centralized machine learning architecture, and the JAX developer documentation has multiple examples. Because the ML model parameters are stored in the DeviceArray data format, setting up the federated workload requires some knowledge of JAX. To be compatible with the Flower NumPyClient, those arguments must be converted to NumPy ndarrays. The JAX meets Flower example below demonstrates how a Flower setup might work.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all,
 I have been interested in a field called pattern theory for some time now. Its a mathematical formalism to describe patterns in the world, as well as a framework for developing ai.
 As far as I can tell, pattern theory seems to be somewhat of a dead field. I'm not sure who is possibly still thinking about it other than a single digit number of academics (e.g. David Mumford). I find this a bit unfortunate, since while I'm still a bit naïve about the field, I'd like to find people I could talk to about it.
 Does anyone have any recommendations for where I could find people I could talk to about pattern theory/bounce ideas off of relating to pattern theory?
 Thanks in advance

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello,
 I am looking at having a neural network take inputs of 8 objects that all have different features/attributes and then an input of the different features/attributes of the environment the objects are in. The output of this would be the rank of each object. The attached image demonstrates a diagram of the neural network. The objects actively interact/compete with each other. I thought about inputting a single object's features and the environment into a neural network with the output as a performance score of the object. However, the object does worse or better depending on what other objects it is competing against. The objects also get better or worse over time, so it may be good to backpropagate and analyze the objects also as a time series.
 Is it possible to input the object/object features as a matrix? I have not figured out a way to group this data. I was thinking maybe a convolution neural network may work. I am somewhat new to the machine learning world. Any recommendation or help would be great. Thank you

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey everybody,
 around half a year ago, I created a simple job aggregator called datajoblist.com, which fetches/scrapes remote jobs in data science, data engineering and AI from multiple sources and presents them in a simple, unified interface. The jobs are collected both directly from interesting (to me) companies like Stripe or Shopify, as well as filtered from job boards such as weworkremotely.com.
 I have not touched the site since when I first built it half a year ago, but it seems that people are finding it helpful, as it is now getting rather stable lower few thousand unique visitors per month, and has facilitated thousands of “apply” click-throughs to company sites. A few dozen people even signed up for the mailing list. So, I was thinking about investing a little more time now and adding some improvements.
 Is there any information/functionality that you would like to see there?
 Shortly, I will be adding the possibility to post jobs for a small fee (till now, all jobs on the site have been aggregated from elsewhere), but would love to add some usability improvements that are reasonably simple to implement for me. (Perhaps salary ranges, where available?)
 Thanks for any feedback and have a great day!

However, in CNN, each pixel also aggregates its neighbors. But CNN can still perform well on some pixel-level classification tasks such as segmentation.

 Large language models such as GPT-3 have enabled many breakthroughs and new applications recently, but they come with an important downside: Training them is very expensive, and even fine-tuning is often difficult. This paper presents an adaptive method to improve performance of such models after deployment, without ever changing the model itself. This is done by maintaining a memory of interactions and then dynamically adapting new prompts by augmenting them with memory content. This has many applications, from non-intrusive fine-tuning to personalization.

During the time the agent is unavailable, several rewards are produced by the environment, and they need to be given to the agent whenever it becomes available again. 
 One easy way to deal with this is to just store them and set the reward at the next available state as the sum of the accumulated rewards. But in the discounted reward framework with temporal difference (e.g. DQN) this does not discount rewards properly. How can I set the reward for the next state such that it contains all the accumulated rewards but it is correct in the DQN setting?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[t-SNE remains a popular embedding method for visualizing high-dimensional data. However, there is little consensus on how to select hyperparameters such as perplexity, learning rate, and exaggeration to best visualize arbitrary data sets.
 This work systematically explores t-SNE hyperparameters using almost 700 data sets. We replicate past studies, proving that some t-SNE guidelines generalize beyond their original context. But we find that some guidelines do not appear to generalize. We also show a proof of concept neural network system for featurizing data sets and automatically recommending good t-SNE hyperparameters.

 I just released the initial version of MLbot (https://github.com/thecooltechguy/mlbot): a new open-source tool that I’ve been working on for running distributed ML training jobs in your cloud, with a single command.
 How it works:
 In short, it allows you to run your training script in the cloud by simply swapping “python” for “mlbot run”.
 For example, if ``python train.py … can run your training script locally, then mlbot run --instance-type p3dn.24xlarge --num-nodes 2 train.py … should be able to run your code in the cloud across 2 GPU machines.
 Since this tool runs entirely inside your cloud environment, you don’t have to transfer your training data to a 3rd party, while having full observability into the underlying infrastructure.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have excelled at solving complex real-world problems, however, training a good DNN has become more complex. It is challenging to ensure that the optimizers used will converge to reliable minima with acceptable model performance when only minimizing the conventional empirical loss.
 Tsinghua University’s research team proposes Stochastic Scheduled SAM (SS-SAM), a novel and effective DNN training strategy. In SS-SAM, the optimizer is set up by a predetermined scheduling function to run a random trial at each update step, which selects whether to perform the SGD or SAM optimization at random. The overall number of propagation pairs could be significantly decreased in this approach. The team’s approach provides equivalent or higher model training performance at a lower computational cost than baseline sharpness-aware minimization (SAM).

It is challenging to ensure that the optimizers used will converge to reliable minima with acceptable model performance when only minimizing the conventional empirical loss.
 Tsinghua University’s research team proposes Stochastic Scheduled SAM (SS-SAM), a novel and effective DNN training strategy. In SS-SAM, the optimizer is set up by a predetermined scheduling function to run a random trial at each update step, which selects whether to perform the SGD or SAM optimization at random. The overall number of propagation pairs could be significantly decreased in this approach. The team’s approach provides equivalent or higher model training performance at a lower computational cost than baseline sharpness-aware minimization (SAM).

 That post gain some traction on Reddit and I hope you would like the one I am gonna introduce here again. 
 In the recent years, I have been shifting my focus from cancer detection to the actual treatment. 
 One particular problem we really want to solve is to have more brain cancer patients to be accessible to stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) which has a lot better treatment outcome and much better quality of life (QoL) for the patient than whole brain radiotherapy (WBRT) which is more common for patients with multiple brainiest (say more than 5 or 10).

 Well, I'm not familiar with other cloud services like Azure or AWS but I used Google Colab a lot, and right at this moment I also use it. But it's constantly asking if I'm "there". It always wants an interaction otherwise it shutdowns the session and my time gets wasted, just gotta do everything from the start.
 So if I pay for the colab pro (unpluss) version, will my experience get better? Will I need to interact with colab every hour again? Or should I consider other alternatives?

 https://m12.vc/news/direct-line-with-saurabh-tiwary-whats-next-for-large-foundational-models
  
The economics are making it untenable for most people except the most well-funded organizations to invest in large language models. I will make the comparison to the semiconductor ecosystem. If you look at fabrication economics for semiconductor chips, they cost tens to hundreds of millions of dollars and have relatively short lifetimes. One needs very large volume usage to justify manufacturing a custom ASIC (Application Specific Integrated Circuits). Thus, we do not have that many companies fabricating chips. However, we have an entire software and systems eco-system which relies on these chips that have built massive industries around them. And, if you look at the biggest companies in the world (maybe, except Apple), they have very little to do with ASIC design and fabrication as part of their core business. I think a similar eco-system would pan out in the large-scale modeling space as well. We would have a few well-funded companies that would be training these extremely large and reusable models and other companies would build applications and services reusing and customizing these models.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello all,
 I have a question regarding optimizing a policy represented by a neural network. In Supervised Learning, the intermediate activations created during the forward pass are needed during backpropagation in order to compute weight gradients. This has led to a number of memory management techniques such as offloading and checkpointing being created.
 My question is whether the same is true in DRL. For policy-gradient methods for example, learning starts from an objective computed from the trajectory such as the discounted returns, but are the intermediate activations created during action inference needed when optimizing the policy (i.e. learning)? 
 Is there any academic source that covers this topic? 
 Thanks!

 Then coding it with some basic "values" and creating some sort of generic conditional statement for the 3 basic values that it has that match yours.
 Then, over time, actually diving into artificial intelligence and slowly updating and replacing those to continue improving it to match you (and your growth)?
 Hmmm, I wonder if there would be a way to preserve it. Everything changes (like sites -> VR and so on). So some sort of "survival" instinct (which seems impossible to code but would be fun to try undertaking).

 I'm working in some state space X. For every x in X, I can assign it a value. When I perform an action a given x, I map x to some new state x'. The state x' depends on my action up to some noise produced by the environment. 
 I think this is a reinforcement learning problem. What methods are suitable in this context?

The success of AlphaFold demonstrated that deep neural networks might be used to solve challenging and critical structural biology problems.
 FastFold is a highly effective protein structure prediction model formulation for training and inference developed by a group of researchers from the National University of Singapore. Although AlphaFold 2 is a game-changer in protein structure prediction, training and inference remain time-consuming and costly. This is something that the study team is concerned about.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In real-time forecasting in public health, data collection is a non-trivial
and demanding task. Often after initially released, it undergoes several
revisions later (maybe due to human or technical constraints) - as a result, it
may take weeks until the data reaches to a stable value. This so-called
'backfill' phenomenon and its effect on model performance has been barely
studied in the prior literature. In this paper, we introduce the multi-variate
backfill problem using COVID-19 as the motivating example. We construct a
detailed dataset composed of relevant signals over the past year of the
pandemic. We then systematically characterize several patterns in backfill
dynamics and leverage our observations for formulating a novel problem and
neural framework Back2Future that aims to refines a given model's predictions
in real-time. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that our method refines the
performance of top models for COVID-19 forecasting, in contrast to non-trivial
baselines, yielding 18% improvement over baselines, enabling us obtain a new
SOTA performance. In addition, we show that our model improves model evaluation
too; hence policy-makers can better understand the true accuracy of forecasting
models in real-time.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey, I am wondering about the losses of conditional GANs, particularly their magnitude. Due to the amount of classes/identities, the classification loss will usually be significantly higher than discrimination loss (data identified as real or generated). When using traditional multitask learning where losses are simply summed up, how is the generator supposed to learn to generate realistic-appearing data when the loss that would encourage that is so low in comparison to the classification loss?

In my opinion, the value function is used as a baseline since it assign high value to state with high expected return, and every action in this state have the same baseline. 
 Pseudocode in sutton's book
 But I also see a Q-version of AC algorithm, which use Q function as the baseline. In this algorithm, the Q function is used to update the policy, and the TD error is used to update the Q function. How could we get this?
 Q Actor-critic
 Another question is about AC and A2C. Is expected return (G) minus baseline the same as the advantage function in A2C? If so, is that AC with baseline the same as A2C?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi Guys! I am just starting out in RL and I have a possibly stupid question about deep q-learning. Why do all of the code examples train the model on its own discounted prediction plus the reward, if they could just record all of the rewards in an episode and then calculate the total discounted rewards from the actual rewards the agent got in the episode? At least in my Implementations, the latter strategy seems to outperform the former, both in regard to the time it took the model to converge and the quality of the learned policy.

 ​
 I'm trying to train a GAN to generate video game portraits (think Baldur's Gate, Divinity, that kind of stuff).
 My GAN is trained on 4096 portraits, 128x192 pixels in size.
 Batch size is 64, 64 features, 128 dim noise vector.
 ​
 After a few epochs of the expected low quality random stuff, my Generator starts generating images where you can kind of imagine silhouettes and faces. Here's after 250 epochs:
 ​

 But after 500 the results are pretty much the same:
 ​
 https://preview.redd.it/k9ikn9k7zpp81.png?width=568&format=png&auto=webp&s=3ec106e5ef5d54c3a8162bb45941fb3f3f9af4a2
 Losses seem be mostly stable fairly quickly too (sorry, lost the graph after I accidentally shutdown my computer - I save the model every 25 epochs but not the losses graph):
 Epoch 255 Step 16320: Generator loss: 7.4651877045631405, critic loss: -9.97341676712036
 ...
 Epoch 310 Step 19840: Generator loss: 7.401800179481507, critic loss: -9.479909801483156
 ...
 Epoch 511 Step 32720: Generator loss: 11.518763446807862, critic loss: -8.105796337127687
 (The 7.5 -> 11.5 GLoss looks pretty much flat on the graph. Maybe the huge initial losses puts it out of perspective?)
 ​
 Is my GAN "stuck" or do I just need to keep training, and quality gains from that point on are going to be slower?

 Is there any guideline about how skip connections should be implemented in GANs? I'm using a very normal resnet type skip connection. The FID score keeps worsening since the start of training, and I've tweaked a lot of hyperparameters, but I still don't have see any improvements. Although I could not train that many epochs because I'm training this on colab.
 You can find the codes here to see the architecture: Generator and Critic.
 Another info: The dataset is roughly 100K book covers I've scraped from internet.

 do I treat it like an image without the processing being necessary. can I reshape it into a matrix the size of the raw image output, and throw it into a series of convolutional layers? or do I treat it as positional data like the location of all the objects?

This should make predicting properties of drugs particularly problematic because we are not drawing further testing samples from a distribution that is similar to the training distribution, but we’re completely changing the input as we wish. Why is machine learning/deep learning successful at predicting these properties when the wider research community is struggling to make deep learning models robust, never mind causal, in general.

I was really surprised. Is there an advantage for buying a rack-mount GPU server over a GPU Workstation given it cost more for similar or lower specifications?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When making zero-shot inference, large pre-trained models like CLIP or ALIGN provide consistent accuracy across various data distributions (i.e., without fine-tuning on a specific dataset). While existing fine-tuning methods vastly improve accuracy on a given target distribution, they frequently compromise robustness to distribution shifts. This conflict can be resolved by presenting a simple and effective strategy for enhancing robustness while fine-tuning: assembling the zero-shot and fine-tuned models (WiSE-FT). 
 An approach for fine-tuning AI models that enhance robustness during distribution shift has been open-sourced by researchers from the University of Washington (UW), Google Brain, and Columbia University. According to tests, WISE-FT improves accuracy by up to 6% on specific computer vision (CV) benchmarks.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Recently, a surge of interest in visual transformers is to reduce the
computational cost by limiting the calculation of self-attention to a local
window. Most current work uses a fixed single-scale window for modeling by
default, ignoring the impact of window size on model performance. However, this
may limit the modeling potential of these window-based models for multi-scale
information. In this paper, we propose a novel method, named Dynamic Window
Vision Transformer (DW-ViT). The dynamic window strategy proposed by DW-ViT
goes beyond the model that employs a fixed single window setting. To the best
of our knowledge, we are the first to use dynamic multi-scale windows to
explore the upper limit of the effect of window settings on model performance.
In DW-ViT, multi-scale information is obtained by assigning windows of
different sizes to different head groups of window multi-head self-attention.
Then, the information is dynamically fused by assigning different weights to
the multi-scale window branches. We conducted a detailed performance evaluation
on three datasets, ImageNet-1K, ADE20K, and COCO. Compared with related
state-of-the-art (SoTA) methods, DW-ViT obtains the best performance.
Specifically, compared with the current SoTA Swin Transformers
\cite{liu2021swin}, DW-ViT has achieved consistent and substantial improvements
on all three datasets with similar parameters and computational costs. In
addition, DW-ViT exhibits good scalability and can be easily inserted into any
window-based visual transformers.]]></summary>

widely used in reinforcement learning to improve the robustness of a learned

worst-case perturbations of the reward function, which are chosen from a
limited set by an imagined adversary. Using convex duality, we characterize
this robust set of adversarial reward perturbations under KL and
alpha-divergence regularization, which includes Shannon and Tsallis entropy
regularization as special cases. Importantly, generalization guarantees can be
given within this robust set. We provide detailed discussion of the worst-case
reward perturbations, and present intuitive empirical examples to illustrate
this robustness and its relationship with generalization. Finally, we discuss
how our analysis complements and extends previous results on adversarial reward
robustness and path consistency optimality conditions.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Data-driven modeling is an imperative tool in various industrial
applications, including many applications in the sectors of aeronautics and
commercial aviation. These models are in charge of providing key insights, such
as which parameters are important on a specific measured outcome or which
parameter values we should expect to observe given a set of input parameters.
At the same time, however, these models rely heavily on assumptions (e.g.,
stationarity) or are "black box" (e.g., deep neural networks), meaning that
they lack interpretability of their internal working and can be viewed only in
terms of their inputs and outputs. An interpretable alternative to the "black
box" models and with considerably less assumptions is symbolic regression (SR).
SR searches for the optimal model structure while simultaneously optimizing the
model's parameters without relying on an a-priori model structure. In this
work, we apply SR on real-life exhaust gas temperature (EGT) data, collected at

fully utilise available data for selfsupervised identification of atypical
scenes or objects. State-of-the-art augmentation methods arbitrarily embed
"structural" peculiarity on typical images so that classifying these artefacts
can provide guidance for learning representations for the detection of
anomalous visual signals. In this paper, however, we argue that learning such
structure-sensitive representations can be a suboptimal approach to some
classes of anomaly (e.g., unhealthy fruits) which could be better recognised by
a different type of visual element such as "colour". We thus propose Channel
Randomisation as a novel data augmentation method for restricting neural
networks to learn encoding of "colour irregularity" whilst predicting
channel-randomised images to ultimately build reliable fruit-monitoring robots
identifying atypical fruit qualities. Our experiments show that (1) this
colour-based alternative can better learn representations for consistently
accurate identification of fruit anomalies in various fruit species, and also,
(2) unlike other methods, the validation accuracy can be utilised as a
criterion for early stopping of training in practice due to positive
correlation between the performance in the self-supervised
colour-differentiation task and the subsequent detection rate of actual
anomalous fruits. Also, the proposed approach is evaluated on a new
agricultural dataset, Riseholme-2021, consisting of 3.5K strawberry images
gathered by a mobile robot, which we share online to encourage active
agri-robotics research.]]></summary>

have to be resolved through observational data. Therefore, we are frequently
confronted with combinatorial optimization problems of which the objective

contrast to the common practice that relies on a learning-and-optimization
strategy, we consider the regression between combinatorial spaces, aiming to
infer high-quality optimization solutions from samples of input-solution pairs
-- without the need to learn the objective function. Our main deliverable is a
universal solver that is able to handle abstract undetermined stochastic

learning-error analysis under the PAC-Bayesian framework using a new
margin-based analysis. In empirical studies, we demonstrate our design using
proof-of-concept experiments, and compare it with other methods that are

that has been shown to improve the alignment of functional regions relative to
volumetric approaches. Classically, image registration is performed by
optimizing a complex objective similarity function, leading to long run times.
This contributes to a convention for aligning all data to a global average
reference frame that poorly reflects the underlying cortical heterogeneity. In
this paper, we propose a novel unsupervised learning-based framework that
converts registration to a multi-label classification problem, where each point
in a low-resolution control grid deforms to one of fixed, finite number of
endpoints. This is learned using a spherical geometric deep learning
architecture, in an end-to-end unsupervised way, with regularization imposed
using a deep Conditional Random Field (CRF). Experiments show that our proposed
framework performs competitively, in terms of similarity and areal distortion,
relative to the most popular classical surface registration algorithms and
generates smoother deformations than other learning-based surface registration
methods, even in subjects with atypical cortical morphology.]]></summary>

as controlling prosthetic hands or robotic arms. Gesture recognition exploiting
surface electromyographic (sEMG) signals is one of the most promising
approaches, given that sEMG signal acquisition is non-invasive and is directly
related to muscle contraction. However, the analysis of these signals still
presents many challenges since similar gestures result in similar muscle
contractions. Thus the resulting signal shapes are almost identical, leading to
low classification accuracy. To tackle this challenge, complex neural networks
are employed, which require large memory footprints, consume relatively high
energy and limit the maximum battery life of devices used for classification.
This work addresses this problem with the introduction of the Bioformers. This
new family of ultra-small attention-based architectures approaches
state-of-the-art performance while reducing the number of parameters and
operations of 4.9X. Additionally, by introducing a new inter-subjects
pre-training, we improve the accuracy of our best Bioformer by 3.39%, matching
state-of-the-art accuracy without any additional inference cost. Deploying our
best performing Bioformer on a Parallel, Ultra-Low Power (PULP) microcontroller
unit (MCU), the GreenWaves GAP8, we achieve an inference latency and energy of
2.72 ms and 0.14 mJ, respectively, 8.0X lower than the previous
state-of-the-art neural network, while occupying just 94.2 kB of memory.]]></summary>

measurements (CMs) to estimate accurate positions even in multipath propagation
scenarios. State-of-the art CM fingerprinting(FP)-based methods employ
convolutional neural networks (CNN) to extract the spatial information.
However, they need spatially dense data sets (associated with high acquisition
and maintenance efforts) to work well -- which is rarely the case in practical
applications. If such data is not available (or its quality is low), we cannot
compensate the performance degradation of CNN-based FP as they do not provide
statistical position estimates, which prevents a fusion with other sources of
information on the observation level.

We propose a novel localization framework that adapts well to sparse datasets
that only contain CMs of specific areas within the environment with strong
multipath propagation. Our framework compresses CMs into informative features
to unravel spatial information. It then regresses Gaussian processes (GPs) for
each of them, which imply statistical observation models based on
distance-dependent covariance kernels. Our framework combines the trained GPs
with line-of-sight ranges and a dynamics model in a particle filter. Our
measurements show that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art CNN
fingerprinting (0.52 m vs. 1.3 m MAE) on spatially sparse data collected in a

provided huge improvements on vision-and-language (V&L) tasks as well as on
pure language tasks. However, fine-tuning the entire parameter set of
pre-trained models becomes impractical since the model size is growing rapidly.
Hence, in this paper, we introduce adapter-based parameter-efficient transfer
learning techniques to V&L models such as VL-BART and VLT5. We evaluate our
methods in a unified multi-task setup on both image-text and video-text
benchmarks. For the image-text tasks, we use four diverse V&L datasets: VQAv2,
GQA, NLVR2 , and MSCOCO image captioning. For video-text tasks, we use TVQA,
How2QA, TVC, and YC2C. With careful training and thorough experiments, we
benchmark three popular adapter-based methods (Adapter, Hyperformer, Compacter)
against the standard full fine-tuning and the recently proposed prompt-tuning
approach. We also enhance the efficiency and performance of adapters by sharing
their weights to attain knowledge across tasks. Our results demonstrate that
training the adapter with the weight-sharing technique (4.18% of total
parameters for image-text tasks and 3.39% for video-text tasks) can match the
performance of fine-tuning the entire model. Lastly, we present a comprehensive
analysis including the combination of adapter and task-specific prompts and the
impact of V&L pre-training on adapters. Our code is available at:

perceptual scale. This is mostly done directly by rating, e.g. using single or

All these methods estimate the perceptual magnitudes of the stimuli on a scale.
However, procedures such as Maximum Likelihood Difference Scaling (MLDS) have
shown that considering perceptual distances can bring benefits in terms of
discriminatory power, observers' cognitive load, and the number of trials
required. One of the disadvantages of the MLDS method is that the perceptual
scales obtained for stimuli created from different source content are generally
not comparable. In this paper, we propose an extension of the MLDS method that
ensures inter-content comparability of the results and shows its usefulness

convergence speedup properties on very large problems. However, they inherently
suffer from communication related slowdowns and communication topology becomes
a crucial design choice. Common approaches supported by most machine learning
frameworks are: 1) Synchronous decentralized algorithms relying on a
peer-to-peer All Reduce topology that is sensitive to stragglers and
communication delays. 2) Asynchronous centralised algorithms with a server
based topology that is prone to communication bottleneck. Researchers also
suggested asynchronous decentralized algorithms designed to avoid the
bottleneck and speedup training, however, those commonly use inexact sparse
averaging that may lead to a degradation in accuracy. In this paper, we propose
Local Asynchronous SGD (LASGD), an asynchronous decentralized algorithm that
relies on All Reduce for model synchronization.

We empirically validate LASGD's performance on image classification tasks on
the ImageNet dataset. Our experiments demonstrate that LASGD accelerates
training compared to SGD and state of the art gossip based approaches.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Novel prediction methods should always be compared to a baseline to know how
well they perform. Without this frame of reference, the performance score of a
model is basically meaningless. What does it mean when a model achieves an
$F_1$ of 0.8 on a test set? A proper baseline is needed to evaluate the
`goodness' of a performance score. Comparing with the latest state-of-the-art
model is usually insightful. However, being state-of-the-art can change rapidly
when newer models are developed. Contrary to an advanced model, a simple dummy
classifier could be used. However, the latter could be beaten too easily,
making the comparison less valuable. This paper presents a universal baseline
method for all binary classification models, named the Dutch Draw (DD). This
approach weighs simple classifiers and determines the best classifier to use as
a baseline. We theoretically derive the DD baseline for many commonly used
evaluation measures and show that in most situations it reduces to (almost)
always predicting either zero or one. Summarizing, the DD baseline is: (1)
general, as it is applicable to all binary classification problems; (2) simple,
as it is quickly determined without training or parameter-tuning; (3)
informative, as insightful conclusions can be drawn from the results. The DD
baseline serves two purposes. First, to enable comparisons across research
papers by this robust and universal baseline. Secondly, to provide a sanity
check during the development process of a prediction model. It is a major
warning sign when a model is outperformed by the DD baseline.]]></summary>

(ViT) for the challenging exemplar-free scenario, with special focus on how to
efficiently distill the knowledge of its crucial self-attention mechanism
(SAM). Our work takes an initial step towards a surgical investigation of SAM
for designing coherent continual learning methods in ViTs. We first carry out
an evaluation of established continual learning regularization techniques. We
then examine the effect of regularization when applied to two key enablers of
SAM: (a) the contextualized embedding layers, for their ability to capture
well-scaled representations with respect to the values, and (b) the prescaled
attention maps, for carrying value-independent global contextual information.
We depict the perks of each distilling strategy on two image recognition
benchmarks (CIFAR100 and ImageNet-32) -- while (a) leads to a better overall
accuracy, (b) helps enhance the rigidity by maintaining competitive
performances. Furthermore, we identify the limitation imposed by the symmetric
nature of regularization losses. To alleviate this, we propose an asymmetric
variant and apply it to the pooled output distillation (POD) loss adapted for
ViTs. Our experiments confirm that introducing asymmetry to POD boosts its
plasticity while retaining stability across (a) and (b). Moreover, we
acknowledge low forgetting measures for all the compared methods, indicating
that ViTs might be naturally inclined continual learner]]></summary>

relationships expressed among them are two primary steps of argument mining.
The intrinsic complexity of these tasks demands powerful learning models. While
pretrained Transformer-based Language Models (LM) have been shown to provide
state-of-the-art results over different NLP tasks, the scarcity of manually
annotated data and the highly domain-dependent nature of argumentation restrict
the capabilities of such models. In this work, we propose a novel transfer
learning strategy to overcome these challenges. We utilize argumentation-rich
social discussions from the ChangeMyView subreddit as a source of unsupervised,
argumentative discourse-aware knowledge by finetuning pretrained LMs on a
selectively masked language modeling task. Furthermore, we introduce a novel
prompt-based strategy for inter-component relation prediction that compliments
our proposed finetuning method while leveraging on the discourse context.
Exhaustive experiments show the generalization capability of our method on
these two tasks over within-domain as well as out-of-domain datasets,
outperforming several existing and employed strong baselines.]]></summary>

Demand-Driven Services (DDS) into urban lives, including ridesharing, on-demand
delivery, express systems and warehousing. In DDS, a service loop is an
elemental structure, including its service worker, the service providers and
corresponding service targets. The service workers should transport either
humans or parcels from the providers to the target locations. Various planning
tasks within DDS can thus be classified into two individual stages: 1)
Dispatching, which is to form service loops from demand/supply distributions,
and 2)Routing, which is to decide specific serving orders within the
constructed loops. Generating high-quality strategies in both stages is
important to develop DDS but faces several challenging. Meanwhile, deep
reinforcement learning (DRL) has been developed rapidly in recent years. It is
a powerful tool to solve these problems since DRL can learn a parametric model
without relying on too many problem-based assumptions and optimize long-term
effect by learning sequential decisions. In this survey, we first define DDS,
then highlight common applications and important decision/control problems
within. For each problem, we comprehensively introduce the existing DRL
solutions. We also introduce open simulation environments for development and
evaluation of DDS applications. Finally, we analyze remaining challenges and
discuss further research opportunities in DRL solutions for DDS.]]></summary>

approximation approach. These models construct a moment-based system of
equations that approximate the particle-based physics as a fluid, but as a
result lack the small-scale physical processes available to fully kinetic
models. Traditionally, empirical closure relations are used to close the
moment-based system of equations, which typically approximate the pressure
tensor or heat flux. The more accurate the closure relation, the stronger the
simulation approaches kinetic-based results. In this paper, new closure terms
are constructed using machine learning techniques. Two different machine
learning models, a multi-layer perceptron and a gradient boosting regressor,
synthesize a local closure relation for the pressure tensor and heat flux
vector from fully kinetic simulations of a 2D magnetic reconnection problem.
The models are compared to an existing closure relation for the pressure
tensor, and the applicability of the models is discussed. The initial results
show that the models can capture the diagonal components of the pressure tensor
accurately, and show promising results for the heat flux, opening the way for
new experiments in multi-scale modeling. We find that the sampling of the
points used to train both models play a capital role in their accuracy.]]></summary>

connecting the sharpness of the loss surface and the generalization gap, we
show that i) training clients locally with Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM)

neighborhoods having uniform low loss, the model converges towards flatter
minima and its generalization significantly improves in both homogeneous and
heterogeneous scenarios. Empirical results demonstrate the effectiveness of
those optimizers across a variety of benchmark vision datasets (e.g.

propose a unique loss scheduling function to overcome local minima during
optimization. We evaluate GadViT on ImageNet1K and MS-Celeb-1M datasets, and
observe unprecedentedly high fidelity and closeness to the original (hidden)

touch or overlap. In an attempt to automate the process, previous studies
turned to Deep Learning methods, with some formulating the task as a semantic
segmentation problem. These models treat separate chromosome instances as
semantic classes, which we show to be problematic, since it is uncertain which
chromosome should be classed as #1 and #2. Assigning class labels based on
comparison rules, such as the shorter/longer chromosome alleviates, but does
not fully resolve the issue. Instead, we separate the chromosome instances in a
second stage, predicting the orientation of the chromosomes by the model and
use it as one of the key distinguishing factors of the chromosomes. We
demonstrate this method to be effective. Furthermore, we introduce a novel
Double-Angle representation that a neural network can use to predict the
orientation. The representation maps any direction and its reverse to the same
point. Lastly, we present a new expanded synthetic dataset, which is based on
Pommier's dataset, but addresses its issues with insufficient separation

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Convolutional neural networks (CNN) have demonstrated outstanding Compressed
Sensing (CS) performance compared to traditional, hand-crafted methods.
However, they are broadly limited in terms of generalisability, inductive bias
and difficulty to model long distance relationships. Transformer neural
networks (TNN) overcome such issues by implementing an attention mechanism
designed to capture dependencies between inputs. However, high-resolution tasks
typically require vision Transformers (ViT) to decompose an image into
patch-based tokens, limiting inputs to inherently local contexts. We propose a
novel image decomposition that naturally embeds images into low-resolution
inputs. These Kaleidoscope tokens (KD) provide a mechanism for global
attention, at the same computational cost as a patch-based approach. To
showcase this development, we replace CNN components in a well-known CS-MRI
neural network with TNN blocks and demonstrate the improvements afforded by KD.
We also propose an ensemble of image tokens, which enhance overall image
quality and reduces model size. Supplementary material is available:

equilibrium problems that exhibit symmetric interactions among the agents,
which are known to be potential. As may happen in practical cases, however, we
envision a scenario in which the formal expression of the underlying potential
function is not available, and we design a semi-decentralized Nash equilibrium
seeking algorithm. In the proposed two-layer scheme, a coordinator iteratively
integrates the (possibly noisy and sporadic) agents' feedback to learn the
pseudo-gradients of the agents, and then design personalized incentives for
them. On their side, the agents receive those personalized incentives, compute
a solution to an extended game, and then return feedback measurements to the
coordinator. In the stationary setting, our algorithm returns a Nash
equilibrium in case the coordinator is endowed with standard learning policies,
while it returns a Nash equilibrium up to a constant, yet adjustable, error in
the time-varying case. As a motivating application, we consider the ridehailing
service provided by several companies with mobility as a service orchestration,
necessary to both handle competition among firms and avoid traffic congestion,
which is also adopted to run numerical experiments verifying our results.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sparse decision tree optimization has been one of the most fundamental
problems in AI since its inception and is a challenge at the core of
interpretable machine learning. Sparse decision tree optimization is
computationally hard, and despite steady effort since the 1960's, breakthroughs
have only been made on the problem within the past few years, primarily on the
problem of finding optimal sparse decision trees. However, current
state-of-the-art algorithms often require impractical amounts of computation
time and memory to find optimal or near-optimal trees for some real-world
datasets, particularly those having several continuous-valued features. Given
that the search spaces of these decision tree optimization problems are
massive, can we practically hope to find a sparse decision tree that competes
in accuracy with a black box machine learning model? We address this problem
via smart guessing strategies that can be applied to any optimal
branch-and-bound-based decision tree algorithm. We show that by using these
guesses, we can reduce the run time by multiple orders of magnitude, while
providing bounds on how far the resulting trees can deviate from the black
box's accuracy and expressive power. Our approach enables guesses about how to
bin continuous features, the size of the tree, and lower bounds on the error
for the optimal decision tree. Our experiments show that in many cases we can
rapidly construct sparse decision trees that match the accuracy of black box
models. To summarize: when you are having trouble optimizing, just guess.]]></summary>

employing domain-specific knowledge over key image regions (faces and salient
objects), and (iii) adapting classifier-free guidance for the transformer use
case. Our model achieves state-of-the-art FID and human evaluation results,
unlocking the ability to generate high fidelity images in a resolution of
512x512 pixels, significantly improving visual quality. Through scene
controllability, we introduce several new capabilities: (i) Scene editing, (ii)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Client-wise data heterogeneity is one of the major issues that hinder
effective training in federated learning (FL). Since the data distribution on
each client may vary dramatically, the client selection strategy can
significantly influence the convergence rate of the FL process. Active client
selection strategies are popularly proposed in recent studies. However, they
neglect the loss correlations between the clients and achieve only marginal
improvement compared to the uniform selection strategy. In this work, we
propose FedCor -- an FL framework built on a correlation-based client selection
strategy, to boost the convergence rate of FL. Specifically, we first model the
loss correlations between the clients with a Gaussian Process (GP). Based on
the GP model, we derive a client selection strategy with a significant
reduction of expected global loss in each round. Besides, we develop an
efficient GP training method with a low communication overhead in the FL
scenario by utilizing the covariance stationarity. Our experimental results
show that compared to the state-of-the-art method, FedCorr can improve the
convergence rates by $34\%\sim 99\%$ and $26\%\sim 51\%$ on FMNIST and
CIFAR-10, respectively.]]></summary>

three-dimensional (3D) imaging of hundreds of micrometers of tissue with
nanometer-scale resolution, providing new opportunities to study the
ultrastructure of the brain. In this work, we introduce a freely available
Matlab-based gACSON software for visualization, segmentation, assessment, and
morphology analysis of myelinated axons in 3D-EM volumes of brain tissue
samples. Methods: The software is equipped with a graphical user interface
(GUI). It automatically segments the intra-axonal space of myelinated axons and
their corresponding myelin sheaths and allows manual segmentation,
proofreading, and interactive correction of the segmented components. gACSON
analyzes the morphology of myelinated axons, such as axonal diameter, axonal
eccentricity, myelin thickness, or g-ratio. Results: We illustrate the use of
the software by segmenting and analyzing myelinated axons in six 3D-EM volumes
of rat somatosensory cortex after sham surgery or traumatic brain injury (TBI).
Our results suggest that the equivalent diameter of myelinated axons in
somatosensory cortex was decreased in TBI animals five months after the injury.
Conclusions: Our results indicate that gACSON is a valuable tool for
visualization, segmentation, assessment, and morphology analysis of myelinated
axons in 3D-EM volumes. It is freely available at

(Smooth Overlap of Atomic Position) features, implemented here in a very
efficient way. The key ingredients are: i) a sparsification technique, based on
farthest point sampling, ensuring generality and transferability of our MLPs
and ii) the so called $\Delta$-learning, allowing a small training data set, a
fundamental property for highly accurate but computationally demanding
calculations, such as the ones based on quantum Monte Carlo. As the first
application we present a benchmark study of the liquid-liquid transition of
high-pressure hydrogen and show the quality of our MLP, by emphasizing the
importance of high accuracy for this very debated subject, where experiments
are difficult in the lab, and theory is still far from being conclusive.]]></summary>

themselves to be a powerful tool in all facets of society. However, due to
budget limitations, deliberate or non-deliberate censorship, and other problems
during data collection and curation, the labeled training set might exhibit a
systematic shortage of data for certain groups. We investigate a scenario in
which the absence of certain data is linked to the second level of a two-level
hierarchy in the data. Inspired by the idea of protected groups from
algorithmic fairness, we refer to the partitions carved by this second level as
"subgroups"; we refer to combinations of subgroups and classes, or leaves of
the hierarchy, as "sources". To characterize the problem, we introduce the
concept of classes with incomplete subgroup support. The representational bias
in the training set can give rise to spurious correlations between the classes
and the subgroups which render standard classification models ungeneralizable
to unseen sources. To overcome this bias, we make use of an additional, diverse
but unlabeled dataset, called the "deployment set", to learn a representation
that is invariant to subgroup. This is done by adversarially matching the
support of the training and deployment sets in representation space. In order
to learn the desired invariance, it is paramount that the sets of samples
observed by the discriminator are balanced by class; this is easily achieved
for the training set, but requires using semi-supervised clustering for the
deployment set. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method with experiments
on several datasets and variants of the problem.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Transformer-based language models (TLMs) provide state-of-the-art performance
in many modern natural language processing applications. TLM training is
conducted in two phases. First, the model is pre-trained over large volumes of
text to minimize a generic objective function, such as the Masked Language
Model (MLM). Second, the model is fine-tuned in specific downstream tasks.
Pre-training requires large volumes of data and high computational resources,
while introducing many still unresolved design choices. For instance, selecting
hyperparameters for language model pre-training is often carried out based on
heuristics or grid-based searches. In this work, we propose a multi-armed
bandit-based online optimization framework for the sequential selection of
pre-training hyperparameters to optimize language model performance. We pose
the pre-training procedure as a sequential decision-making task, where at each
pre-training step, an agent must determine what hyperparameters to use towards
optimizing the pre-training objective. We propose a Thompson sampling bandit
algorithm, based on a surrogate Gaussian process reward model of the MLM
pre-training objective, for its sequential minimization. We empirically show
how the proposed Gaussian process based Thompson sampling pre-trains robust and
well-performing language models. Namely, by sequentially selecting masking
hyperparameters of the TLM, we achieve satisfactory performance in less epochs,
not only in terms of the pre-training MLM objective, but in diverse downstream
fine-tuning tasks. The proposed bandit-based technique provides an automated
hyperparameter selection method for pre-training TLMs of interest to
practitioners. In addition, our results indicate that, instead of MLM
pre-training with fixed masking probabilities, sequentially adapting the
masking hyperparameters improves both pre-training loss and downstream task
metrics.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In real-world applications, it is important and desirable to learn a model
that performs well on out-of-distribution (OOD) data. Recently, causality has
become a powerful tool to tackle the OOD generalization problem, with the idea
resting on the causal mechanism that is invariant across domains of interest.
To leverage the generally unknown causal mechanism, existing works assume a
linear form of causal feature or require sufficiently many and diverse training
domains, which are usually restrictive in practice. In this work, we obviate
these assumptions and tackle the OOD problem without explicitly recovering the
causal feature. Our approach is based on transformations that modify the
non-causal feature but leave the causal part unchanged, which can be either
obtained from prior knowledge or learned from the training data in the
multi-domain scenario. Under the setting of invariant causal mechanism, we
theoretically show that if all such transformations are available, then we can
learn a minimax optimal model across the domains using only single domain data.
Noticing that knowing a complete set of these causal invariant transformations
may be impractical, we further show that it suffices to know only a subset of
these transformations. Based on the theoretical findings, a regularized
training procedure is proposed to improve the OOD generalization capability.
Extensive experimental results on both synthetic and real datasets verify the
effectiveness of the proposed algorithm, even with only a few causal invariant
transformations.]]></summary>

high-dimensional probability distributions offer significant theoretical
insights and practical advantages in numerous research areas. Recently, they
have gained popularity in machine learning as a tractable and scalable approach
for training probabilistic models and for statistically differentiating between
data distributions. Their advantages include: 1) They can be estimated from
data as statistical averages. 2) Such representations can leverage the ability
of neural networks to efficiently approximate optimal solutions in function
spaces. However, a systematic and practical approach to improving the tightness
of such variational formulas, and accordingly accelerate statistical learning
and estimation from data, is currently lacking. Here we develop such a
methodology for building new, tighter variational representations of
divergences. Our approach relies on improved objective functionals constructed
via an auxiliary optimization problem. Furthermore, the calculation of the
functional Hessian of objective functionals unveils the local curvature
differences around the common optimal variational solution; this quantifies and
orders the tightness gains between different variational representations.
Finally, numerical simulations utilizing neural network optimization
demonstrate that tighter representations can result in significantly faster
learning and more accurate estimation of divergences in both synthetic and real
datasets (of more than 1000 dimensions), often accelerated by nearly an order

challenge in robotics, with a variety of methods from model-based control to

industrial data based tensor input, which integrates data records of
distributed industrial systems from the spatial, temporal, and system dynamics
aspects. However, unlike images, information in the industrial data based
tensor is not necessarily spatially ordered. Thus, directly applying CNN is
ineffective. To tackle such issue, we propose a plug and play module, the
Rubik's Cube Operator (RCO), to adaptively permutate the data organization of
the industrial data based tensor to an optimal or suboptimal order of
attributes before being processed by CNNs, which can be updated with subsequent
CNNs together via the gradient-based optimizer. The proposed RCO maintains K
binary and right stochastic permutation matrices to permutate attributes of K
axes of the input industrial data based tensor. A novel learning process is
proposed to enable learning permutation matrices from data, where the
Gumbel-Softmax is employed to reparameterize elements of permutation matrices,
and the soft regularization loss is proposed and added to the task-specific
loss to ensure the feature diversity of the permuted data. We verify the
effectiveness of the proposed RCO via considering two representative learning
tasks processing industrial data via CNNs, the wind power prediction (WPP) and
the wind speed prediction (WSP) from the renewable energy domain. Computational

Decision Processes (MDP) that enjoys a regret bound \emph{independent on the

the need of a large number of high-quality image-text pairs. While image
samples are often easily accessible, the associated text descriptions typically
require careful human captioning, which is particularly time- and
cost-consuming. In this paper, we propose the first work to train text-to-image
generation models without any text data. Our method leverages the well-aligned
multi-modal semantic space of the powerful pre-trained CLIP model: the
requirement of text-conditioning is seamlessly alleviated via generating text
features from image features. Extensive experiments are conducted to illustrate
the effectiveness of the proposed method. We obtain state-of-the-art results in
the standard text-to-image generation tasks. Importantly, the proposed
language-free model outperforms most existing models trained with full
image-text pairs. Furthermore, our method can be applied in fine-tuning
pre-trained models, which saves both training time and cost in training
text-to-image generation models. Our pre-trained model obtains competitive
results in zero-shot text-to-image generation on the MS-COCO dataset, yet with
around only 1% of the model size and training data size relative to the
recently proposed large DALL-E model.]]></summary>

real-world entity. Although widely studied for the last 50 years, ER still
represents a challenging data management problem, and several recent works have
started to investigate the opportunity of applying deep learning (DL)
techniques to solve this problem. In this paper, we study the fundamental
problem of explainability of the DL solution for ER. Understanding the matching
predictions of an ER solution is indeed crucial to assess the trustworthiness
of the DL model and to discover its biases. We treat the DL model as a black
box classifier and - while previous approaches to provide explanations for DL
predictions are agnostic to the classification task. we propose the CERTA
approach that is aware of the semantics of the ER problem. Our approach
produces both saliency explanations, which associate each attribute with a
saliency score, and counterfactual explanations, which provide examples of
values that can flip the prediction. CERTA builds on a probabilistic framework
that aims at computing the explanations evaluating the outcomes produced by
using perturbed copies of the input records. We experimentally evaluate CERTA's
explanations of state-of-the-art ER solutions based on DL models using publicly
available datasets, and demonstrate the effectiveness of CERTA over recently
proposed methods for this problem.]]></summary>

controllers for autonomous systems operating in stochastic and potentially
adversarial environments. Automatic synthesis tools, however, require a model
of the environment to construct controllers. In this work, we introduce a
model-free reinforcement learning (RL) approach that derives controllers from
given LTL specifications even when the environment is completely unknown. We
model the problem of satisfying the LTL specifications as a stochastic game
(SG) between the controller and the adversarial environment; we then learn
optimal controller strategies that maximize the probability of satisfying the
LTL specifications against the worst-case environment behavior. We first
construct a product game using the deterministic parity automaton (DPA)
translated from the given LTL specification. By deriving distinct rewards and
discount factors from the acceptance condition of the DPA, we reduce the
maximization of the worst-case probability of satisfying the LTL specification
into the maximization of a discounted reward objective in the product game;
this allows for the use of model-free RL algorithms to learn an optimal
controller strategy. To deal with the common scalability problems when the
number of colors defining the acceptance condition of the DPA is large, we
propose a lazy color generation method where distinct rewards and discount
factors are utilized only when needed, and an approximate method where the
controller eventually focuses on only one color. In several case studies, we
show that our approach is scalable to a wide range of LTL formulas,
significantly outperforming existing methods for learning controllers from LTL
specifications in SGs.]]></summary>

reduce the communication overheads without any compromise on security, and
achieve the optimum communication load within a diminishing gap. Specifically,
in presence of at most $D$ dropout users, SwiftAgg+ achieves average per-user

semi-honest users who may also collude with the curious server. The proposed
SwiftAgg+ has also a flexibility to reduce the number of active communication
links at the cost of increasing the the communication load between the users

efficient retrieval of large-scale multi-modal data has become a trendy
research topic. Thereinto, hashing has become a prevalent choice due to its
retrieval efficiency and low storage cost. Although multi-modal hashing has
drawn lots of attention in recent years, there still remain some problems. The
first point is that existing methods are mainly designed in batch mode and not
able to efficiently handle streaming multi-modal data. The second point is that
all existing online multi-modal hashing methods fail to effectively handle
unseen new classes which come continuously with streaming data chunks. In this
paper, we propose a new model, termed Online enhAnced SemantIc haShing (OASIS).
We design novel semantic-enhanced representation for data, which could help
handle the new coming classes, and thereby construct the enhanced semantic
objective function. An efficient and effective discrete online optimization
algorithm is further proposed for OASIS. Extensive experiments show that our
method can exceed the state-of-the-art models. For good reproducibility and

While releasing datasets continues to make a big impact in various applications
of computer vision, its impact is mostly realized when data sharing is not
inhibited by privacy concerns. We alleviate these concerns by sanitizing
datasets in a two-stage process. First, we introduce a global decoupling stage
for decomposing raw data into sensitive and non-sensitive latent
representations. Secondly, we design a local sampling stage to synthetically
generate sensitive information with differential privacy and merge it with
non-sensitive latent features to create a useful representation while
preserving the privacy. This newly formed latent information is a task-agnostic
representation of the original dataset with anonymized sensitive information.
While most algorithms sanitize data in a task-dependent manner, a few
task-agnostic sanitization techniques sanitize data by censoring sensitive
information. In this work, we show that a better privacy-utility trade-off is
achieved if sensitive information can be synthesized privately. We validate the
effectiveness of the sanitizer by outperforming state-of-the-art baselines on
the existing benchmark tasks and demonstrating tasks that are not possible

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The exponentially large discrete search space in mixed-precision quantization
(MPQ) makes it hard to determine the optimal bit-width for each layer. Previous
works usually resort to iterative search methods on the training set, which
consume hundreds or even thousands of GPU-hours. In this study, we reveal that
some unique learnable parameters in quantization, namely the scale factors in
the quantizer, can serve as importance indicators of a layer, reflecting the
contribution of that layer to the final accuracy at certain bit-widths. These
importance indicators naturally perceive the numerical transformation during
quantization-aware training, which can precisely and correctly provide
quantization sensitivity metrics of layers. However, a deep network always
contains hundreds of such indicators, and training them one by one would lead
to an excessive time cost. To overcome this issue, we propose a joint training
scheme that can obtain all indicators at once. It considerably speeds up the
indicators training process by parallelizing the original sequential training
processes. With these learned importance indicators, we formulate the MPQ
search problem as a one-time integer linear programming (ILP) problem. That
avoids the iterative search and significantly reduces search time without
limiting the bit-width search space. For example, MPQ search on ResNet18 with
our indicators takes only 0.06 seconds. Also, extensive experiments show our
approach can achieve SOTA accuracy on ImageNet for far-ranging models with
various constraints (e.g., BitOps, compress rate).]]></summary>

characterizing the content and style of a portrait with an intrinsic style path

style path enables our model to modulate both the color and complex structural

novel progressive fine-tuning scheme is introduced to smoothly transform the

trained models to sequences longer than those seen in training. This
"extrapolating" usage deviates from the traditional statistical learning setup
where guarantees are provided under the assumption that train and test
distributions are identical. Here we set out to understand when RNNs can
extrapolate, focusing on a simple case where the data generating distribution
is memoryless. We first show that even with infinite training data, there exist
RNN models that interpolate perfectly (i.e., they fit the training data) yet
extrapolate poorly to longer sequences. We then show that if gradient descent
is used for training, learning will converge to perfect extrapolation under
certain assumptions on initialization. Our results complement recent studies on
the implicit bias of gradient descent, showing that it plays a key role in
extrapolation when learning temporal prediction models.]]></summary>

nonlinear optimal control problems. The crucial assumption of KL control is the
full controllability of the transition distribution. However, this assumption
is often violated when the dynamics evolves in a continuous space.
Consequently, applying KL control to problems with continuous spaces requires
some approximation, which leads to the lost of the optimality. To avoid such
approximation, in this paper, we reformulate the KL control problem for
continuous spaces so that it does not require unrealistic assumptions. The key
difference between the original and reformulated KL control is that the former
measures the control effort by KL divergence between controlled and
uncontrolled transition distributions while the latter replaces the
uncontrolled transition by a noise-driven transition. We show that the
reformulated KL control admits efficient numerical algorithms like the original
one without unreasonable assumptions. Specifically, the associated value
function can be computed by using a Monte Carlo method based on its path
integral representation.]]></summary>

classifying planktic foraminifer shells on microscopic images. This species
recognition task is an important information source and scientific pillar for

human experts and cannot be applied to open-set problems. Here, we benchmark
metric learning against these pipelines, produce the first scientific
visualization of the phenotypic planktic foraminifer morphology space, and
demonstrate that metric learning can be used to cluster species unseen during
training. We show that metric learning outperforms all published CNN-based
state-of-the-art benchmarks in this domain. We evaluate our approach on the
34,640 expert-annotated images of the Endless Forams public library of 35
modern planktic foraminifera species. Our results on this data show leading 92%
accuracy (at 0.84 F1-score) in reproducing expert labels on withheld test data,
and 66.5% accuracy (at 0.70 F1-score) when clustering species never encountered

field theory for DNNs which predicts that heavy-tailed weights enable the
emergence of an extended critical regime without fine-tuning parameters. In
this extended critical regime, DNNs exhibit rich and complex propagation
dynamics across layers. We further elucidate that the extended criticality
endows DNNs with profound computational advantages: balancing the contraction

unimportant tokens starting from an intermediate layer in the model to make the

We leverage the already built-in masked language modeling (MLM) loss to

the network edge due to the low communication complexity and privacy protection
among other attractive properties. However, existing algorithms face issues
with slow convergence and/or robustness of performance due to the considerable
heterogeneity of data distribution, computation and communication capability at
the edge. In this work, we tackle both of these issues by focusing on the key
component of model aggregation in federated learning systems and studying
optimal algorithms to perform this task. Particularly, we propose a contextual
aggregation scheme that achieves the optimal context-dependent bound on loss
reduction in each round of optimization. The aforementioned context-dependent
bound is derived from the particular participating devices in that round and an
assumption on smoothness of the overall loss function. We show that this
aggregation leads to a definite reduction of loss function at every round.
Furthermore, we can integrate our aggregation with many existing algorithms to
obtain the contextual versions. Our experimental results demonstrate
significant improvements in convergence speed and robustness of the contextual
versions compared to the original algorithms. We also consider different
variants of the contextual aggregation and show robust performance even in the
most extreme settings.]]></summary>

reconstruction algorithms arises. In this work, we learn a parametric
regularizer with a global receptive field by maximizing it's likelihood on
reference CT data. Due to this unsupervised learning strategy, our trained
regularizer truly represents higher-level domain statistics, which we
empirically demonstrate by synthesizing CT images. Moreover, this regularizer
can easily be applied to different CT reconstruction problems by embedding it
in a variational framework, which increases flexibility and interpretability
compared to feed-forward learning-based approaches. In addition, the
accompanying probabilistic perspective enables experts to explore the full
posterior distribution and may quantify uncertainty of the reconstruction
approach. We apply the regularizer to limited-angle and few-view CT
reconstruction problems, where it outperforms traditional reconstruction

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Recent advances in deep learning have enabled optimization of deep reactive
policies (DRPs) for continuous MDP planning by encoding a parametric policy as
a deep neural network and exploiting automatic differentiation in an end-to-end
model-based gradient descent framework. This approach has proven effective for
optimizing DRPs in nonlinear continuous MDPs, but it requires a large number of
sampled trajectories to learn effectively and can suffer from high variance in
solution quality. In this work, we revisit the overall model-based DRP
objective and instead take a minorization-maximization perspective to
iteratively optimize the DRP w.r.t. a locally tight lower-bounded objective.
This novel formulation of DRP learning as iterative lower bound optimization
(ILBO) is particularly appealing because (i) each step is structurally easier
to optimize than the overall objective, (ii) it guarantees a monotonically
improving objective under certain theoretical conditions, and (iii) it reuses
samples between iterations thus lowering sample complexity. Empirical
evaluation confirms that ILBO is significantly more sample-efficient than the
state-of-the-art DRP planner and consistently produces better solution quality
with lower variance. We additionally demonstrate that ILBO generalizes well to
new problem instances (i.e., different initial states) without requiring
retraining.]]></summary>

of a constraint leads to an irrevocable loss, such as breakage of a valuable
experimental resource/platform or loss of human life. Such problems are
referred to as safe optimization problems (SafeOPs). While SafeOPs have
received attention in the machine learning community in recent years, there was
little interest in the evolutionary computation (EC) community despite some
early attempts between 2009 and 2011. Moreover, there is a lack of acceptable
guidelines on how to benchmark different algorithms for SafeOPs, an area where
the EC community has significant experience in. Driven by the need for more
efficient algorithms and benchmark guidelines for SafeOPs, the objective of
this paper is to reignite the interest of this problem class in the EC
community. To achieve this we (i) provide a formal definition of SafeOPs and
contrast it to other types of optimization problems that the EC community is
familiar with, (ii) investigate the impact of key SafeOP parameters on the
performance of selected safe optimization algorithms, (iii) benchmark EC
against state-of-the-art safe optimization algorithms from the machine learning
community, and (iv) provide an open-source Python framework to replicate and

detect bugs in these games' models, human testers play the games repeatedly to
explore the game and find errors in the games. Such game play is exhaustive and
time consuming. Moreover, since robotics simulators depend on similar methods
of model specification and debugging, the problem of finding errors in the
model is of interest for the robotics community to ensure robot behaviors and
interactions are consistent in simulators. Previous methods have used
reinforcement learning and search based methods including Rapidly-exploring
Random Trees (RRT) to explore a game's state-action space to find bugs.
However, such search and exploration based methods are not efficient at
exploring the state-action space without a pre-defined heuristic. In this work
we attempt to combine a human-tester's expertise in solving games, and the
exhaustiveness of RRT to search a game's state space efficiently with high
coverage. This paper introduces human-seeded RRT (HS-RRT) and
behavior-cloning-assisted RRT (CA-RRT) in testing the number of game states
searched and the time taken to explore those game states. We compare our
methods to an existing weighted RRT baseline for game exploration testing
studied. We find HS-RRT and CA-RRT both explore more game states in fewer tree
expansions/iterations when compared to the existing baseline. In each test,
CA-RRT reached more states on average in the same number of iterations as RRT.
In our tested environments, CA-RRT was able to reach the same number of states
as RRT by more than 5000 fewer iterations on average, almost a 50% reduction.]]></summary>

algorithm, Q-FW, for solving quadratic, linearly-constrained, binary
optimization problems on quantum annealers (QA). The computational premise of
quantum computers has cultivated the re-design of various existing vision
problems into quantum-friendly forms. Experimental QA realizations can solve a
particular non-convex problem known as the quadratic unconstrained binary
optimization (QUBO). Yet a naive-QUBO cannot take into account the restrictions
on the parameters. To introduce additional structure in the parameter space,
researchers have crafted ad-hoc solutions incorporating (linear) constraints in
the form of regularizers. However, this comes at the expense of a
hyper-parameter, balancing the impact of regularization. To date, a true
constrained solver of quadratic binary optimization (QBO) problems has lacked.
Q-FW first reformulates constrained-QBO as a copositive program (CP), then
employs Frank-Wolfe iterations to solve CP while satisfying linear (in)equality
constraints. This procedure unrolls the original constrained-QBO into a set of
unconstrained QUBOs all of which are solved, in a sequel, on a QA. We use
D-Wave Advantage QA to conduct synthetic and real experiments on two important
computer vision problems, graph matching and permutation synchronization, which
demonstrate that our approach is effective in alleviating the need for an
explicit regularization coefficient.]]></summary>

dependency structures. Humans and other intelligent agents do not waste time
assessing the utility of every high-level action in existence, but instead only
consider ones they deem possible in the first place. By focusing only on what
is feasible, or "afforded", at the present moment, an agent can spend more time
both evaluating the utility of and acting on what matters. To this end, we
present Hierarchical Affordance Learning (HAL), a method that learns a model of
hierarchical affordances in order to prune impossible subtasks for more
effective learning. Existing works in hierarchical reinforcement learning
provide agents with structural representations of subtasks but are not
affordance-aware, and by grounding our definition of hierarchical affordances
in the present state, our approach is more flexible than the multitude of
approaches that ground their subtask dependencies in a symbolic history. While
these logic-based methods often require complete knowledge of the subtask
hierarchy, our approach is able to utilize incomplete and varying symbolic
specifications. Furthermore, we demonstrate that relative to
non-affordance-aware methods, HAL agents are better able to efficiently learn
complex tasks, navigate environment stochasticity, and acquire diverse skills
in the absence of extrinsic supervision -- all of which are hallmarks of human
learning.]]></summary>

While large organisations often have considerable data assets, it can be
difficult for these assets to be unified in a manner that makes training

with little to no access between silos. This fragmentation of data assets is
especially prevalent in heavily regulated industries like financial services or
healthcare. In this paper we propose a framework to enable asynchronous
collaborative training of machine learning models across data silos. This
allows data science teams to collaboratively train a machine learning model,
without sharing data with one another. Our proposed approach enhances
conventional federated learning techniques to make them suitable for this

their learnable parameters remain independent of the inputs after the training
process, which may limit their capacity for learning highly correlated

parameters of the last layer are scaled by a second neural network that is
conditioned on the model's input, resulting in a parameterization that is
dependent on the input samples. We evaluate our model on multiple datasets and
demonstrate that the learned representations are more correlated in comparison

associated with several pulmonary, cardiac, and systemic diseases contributing
to morbidity and mortality. Therefore, accurate and early detection of PH is
crucial for successful management. Using echocardiography, the primary
diagnostic tool in pediatrics, human assessment is both time-consuming and
expertise-demanding, raising the need for an automated approach. In this work,
we present an interpretable multi-view video-based deep learning approach to
predict PH for a cohort of 194 newborns using echocardiograms. We use
spatio-temporal convolutional architectures for the prediction of PH from each
view, and aggregate the predictions of the different views using majority
voting. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work for an automated
assessment of PH in newborns using echocardiograms. Our results show a mean
F1-score of 0.84 for severity prediction and 0.92 for binary detection using
10-fold cross-validation. We complement our predictions with saliency maps and
show that the learned model focuses on clinically relevant cardiac structures,
motivating its usage in clinical practice.]]></summary>

problem in which targeted error signals guide parameter updating for more
optimal network behaviour. Backpropagation of error (BP) is an example of such
an approach and has proven to be a highly successful application of stochastic
gradient descent to deep neural networks. However, BP relies on the global
transmission of gradient information and has therefore been criticised for its
biological implausibility. We propose constrained parameter inference (COPI) as
a new principle for learning. COPI allows for the estimation of network
parameters under the constraints of decorrelated neural inputs and top-down

on simple VGG-style networks. Despite the prevalence, current Rep methods
simply re-parameterize all operations into an augmented network, including
those that rarely contribute to the model's performance. As such, the price to
pay is an expensive computational overhead to manipulate these unnecessary
behaviors. To eliminate the above caveats, we aim to bootstrap the training
with minimal cost by devising a dynamic re-parameterization (DyRep) method,
which encodes Rep technique into the training process that dynamically evolves
the network structures. Concretely, our proposal adaptively finds the
operations which contribute most to the loss in the network, and applies Rep to
enhance their representational capacity. Besides, to suppress the noisy and
redundant operations introduced by Rep, we devise a de-parameterization
technique for a more compact re-parameterization. With this regard, DyRep is
more efficient than Rep since it smoothly evolves the given network instead of
constructing an over-parameterized network. Experimental results demonstrate
our effectiveness, e.g., DyRep improves the accuracy of ResNet-18 by $2.04\%$
on ImageNet and reduces $22\%$ runtime over the baseline. Code is available at:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Text-to-image synthesis (T2I) aims to generate photo-realistic images which
are semantically consistent with the text descriptions. Existing methods are
usually built upon conditional generative adversarial networks (GANs) and
initialize an image from noise with sentence embedding, and then refine the
features with fine-grained word embedding iteratively. A close inspection of
their generated images reveals a major limitation: even though the generated
image holistically matches the description, individual image regions or parts
of somethings are often not recognizable or consistent with words in the
sentence, e.g. "a white crown". To address this problem, we propose a novel
framework Semantic-Spatial Aware GAN for synthesizing images from input text.
Concretely, we introduce a simple and effective Semantic-Spatial Aware block,
which (1) learns semantic-adaptive transformation conditioned on text to
effectively fuse text features and image features, and (2) learns a semantic
mask in a weakly-supervised way that depends on the current text-image fusion
process in order to guide the transformation spatially. Experiments on the
challenging COCO and CUB bird datasets demonstrate the advantage of our method
over the recent state-of-the-art approaches, regarding both visual fidelity and
alignment with input text description.]]></summary>

associated relationships. Where previously these sets of data have been
formulated as series or image data to match the available machine learning
architectures, with the advent of graph neural networks (GNNs), these systems
can be learned natively as graphs. This allows a wide variety of high- and
low-level physical features to be attached to measurements and, by the same
token, a wide variety of HEP tasks to be accomplished by the same GNN
architectures. GNNs have found powerful use-cases in reconstruction, tagging,
generation and end-to-end analysis. With the wide-spread adoption of GNNs in
industry, the HEP community is well-placed to benefit from rapid improvements
in GNN latency and memory usage. However, industry use-cases are not perfectly
aligned with HEP and much work needs to be done to best match unique GNN
capabilities to unique HEP obstacles. We present here a range of these
capabilities, predictions of which are currently being well-adopted in HEP
communities, and which are still immature. We hope to capture the landscape of

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Purpose: A core component of advancing cancer treatment research is assessing
response to therapy. Doing so by hand, for example as per RECIST or RANO
criteria, is tedious, time-consuming, and can miss important tumor response
information; most notably, they exclude non-target lesions. We wish to assess
change in a holistic fashion that includes all lesions, obtaining simple,
informative, and automated assessments of tumor progression or regression. Due
to often low patient enrolments in clinical trials, we wish to make response
assessments with small training sets. Deep neuroevolution (DNE) can produce
radiology artificial intelligence (AI) that performs well on small training
sets. Here we use DNE for function approximation that predicts progression
versus regression of metastatic brain disease.

Methods: We analyzed 50 pairs of MRI contrast-enhanced images as our training
set. Half of these pairs, separated in time, qualified as disease progression,
while the other 25 images constituted regression. We trained the parameters of
a relatively small CNN via mutations that consisted of random CNN weight
adjustments and mutation fitness. We then incorporated the best mutations into
the next generations CNN, repeating this process for approximately 50,000
generations. We applied the CNNs to our training set, as well as a separate
testing set with the same class balance of 25 progression and 25 regression
images.

Results: DNE achieved monotonic convergence to 100% training set accuracy.
DNE also converged monotonically to 100% testing set accuracy.

Conclusion: DNE can accurately classify brain-metastatic disease progression
versus regression. Future work will extend the input from 2D image slices to
full 3D volumes, and include the category of no change. We believe that an
approach such as our could ultimately provide a useful adjunct to RANO/RECIST
assessment.]]></summary>

representation learning (GRL) without the supervision of manual annotations.
GCL can generate graph-level embeddings by maximizing the Mutual Information
(MI) between different augmented views of the same graph (positive pairs).
However, we identify an obstacle that the optimization of InfoNCE loss only
concentrates on a few embeddings dimensions, limiting the distinguishability of
embeddings in downstream graph classification tasks. This paper proposes an
effective graph complementary contrastive learning approach named GraphCoCo to
tackle the above issue. Specifically, we set the embedding of the first
augmented view as the anchor embedding to localize "highlighted" dimensions
(i.e., the dimensions contribute most in similarity measurement). Then remove
these dimensions in the embeddings of the second augmented view to discover
neglected complementary representations. Therefore, the combination of anchor
and complementary embeddings significantly improves the performance in
downstream tasks. Comprehensive experiments on various benchmark datasets are
conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of GraphCoCo, and the results show
that our model outperforms the state-of-the-art methods. Source code will be

enforcement in the AI industry would cause unbearable costs. When single data
deletion requests come, companies may need to delete the whole models learned
with massive resources. Existing works propose methods to remove knowledge
learned from data for explicitly parameterized models, which however are not
appliable to the sampling-based Bayesian inference, i.e., Markov chain Monte
Carlo (MCMC), as MCMC can only infer implicit distributions. In this paper, we
propose the first machine unlearning algorithm for MCMC. We first convert the
MCMC unlearning problem into an explicit optimization problem. Based on this
problem conversion, an {\it MCMC influence function} is designed to provably
characterize the learned knowledge from data, which then delivers the MCMC
unlearning algorithm. Theoretical analysis shows that MCMC unlearning would not
compromise the generalizability of the MCMC models. Experiments on Gaussian
mixture models and Bayesian neural networks confirm the effectiveness of the
proposed algorithm. The code is available at

It is an even more difficult problem to map the identified human shape onto a
3D human model. Existing methods map manually labelled human pixels in real 2D
images onto the 3D surface, which is prone to human error, and the sparsity of
available annotated data often leads to sub-optimal results. We propose to
solve the problem of data scarcity by training 2D-3D human mapping algorithms
using automatically generated synthetic data for which exact and dense 2D-3D
correspondence is known. Such a learning strategy using synthetic environments
has a high generalisation potential towards real-world data. Using different
camera parameter variations, background and lighting settings, we created
precise ground truth data that constitutes a wider distribution. We evaluate
the performance of models trained on synthetic using the COCO dataset and

on synthetic data is a viable alternative to using real data.]]></summary>

capability of such images. As a method to mitigate such artifact, denoising is
largely studied both within the medical imaging community and beyond the
community as a general subject. However, recent deep neural network-based
approaches mostly rely on the minimum mean squared error (MMSE) estimates,
which tend to produce a blurred output. Moreover, such models suffer when
deployed in real-world sitautions: out-of-distribution data, and complex noise
distributions that deviate from the usual parametric noise models. In this
work, we propose a new denoising method based on score-based reverse diffusion
sampling, which overcomes all the aforementioned drawbacks. Our network,
trained only with coronal knee scans, excels even on out-of-distribution in
vivo liver MRI data, contaminated with complex mixture of noise. Even more, we
propose a method to enhance the resolution of the denoised image with the same
network. With extensive experiments, we show that our method establishes
state-of-the-art performance, while having desirable properties which prior
MMSE denoisers did not have: flexibly choosing the extent of denoising, and
quantifying uncertainty.]]></summary>

generalization in the context of physical manipulation from raw sensor
observations. Compared with the more commonly used global third-person
perspective, a hand-centric (eye-in-hand) perspective affords reduced
observability, but we find that it consistently improves training efficiency
and out-of-distribution generalization. These benefits hold across a variety of
learning algorithms, experimental settings, and distribution shifts, and for
both simulated and real robot apparatuses. However, this is only the case when
hand-centric observability is sufficient; otherwise, including a third-person
perspective is necessary for learning, but also harms out-of-distribution
generalization. To mitigate this, we propose to regularize the third-person
information stream via a variational information bottleneck. On six
representative manipulation tasks with varying hand-centric observability
adapted from the Meta-World benchmark, this results in a state-of-the-art
reinforcement learning agent operating from both perspectives improving its
out-of-distribution generalization on every task. While some practitioners have

different domains, e.g., image classification and audio recognition. However,
the quality of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) still raises concerns in the
practical operational environment, which calls for systematic testing,
especially in safety-critical scenarios. Inspired by software testing, a number
of structural coverage criteria are designed and proposed to measure the test
adequacy of DNNs. However, due to the blackbox nature of DNN, the existing
structural coverage criteria are difficult to interpret, making it hard to
understand the underlying principles of these criteria. The relationship
between the structural coverage and the decision logic of DNNs is unknown.
Moreover, recent studies have further revealed the non-existence of correlation
between the structural coverage and DNN defect detection, which further posts
concerns on what a suitable DNN testing criterion should be.

In this paper, we propose the interpretable coverage criteria through
constructing the decision structure of a DNN. Mirroring the control flow graph
of the traditional program, we first extract a decision graph from a DNN based
on its interpretation, where a path of the decision graph represents a decision
logic of the DNN. Based on the control flow and data flow of the decision
graph, we propose two variants of path coverage to measure the adequacy of the
test cases in exercising the decision logic. The higher the path coverage, the
more diverse decision logic the DNN is expected to be explored. Our large-scale
evaluation results demonstrate that: the path in the decision graph is
effective in characterizing the decision of the DNN, and the proposed coverage
criteria are also sensitive with errors including natural errors and
adversarial examples, and strongly correlated with the output impartiality.]]></summary>

(MAB) in the (local) differential privacy (DP/LDP) model. Unlike previous
results that assume bounded/sub-Gaussian reward distributions, we focus on the
setting where each arm's reward distribution only has $(1+v)$-th moment with
some $v\in (0, 1]$. In the first part, we study the problem in the central
$\epsilon$-DP model. We first provide a near-optimal result by developing a
private and robust Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) algorithm. Then, we improve the
result via a private and robust version of the Successive Elimination (SE)
algorithm. Finally, we establish the lower bound to show that the
instance-dependent regret of our improved algorithm is optimal. In the second
part, we study the problem in the $\epsilon$-LDP model. We propose an algorithm
that can be seen as locally private and robust version of SE algorithm, which
provably achieves (near) optimal rates for both instance-dependent and
instance-independent regret. Our results reveal differences between the problem

in effectiveness, while often sacrificing the efficiency and interpretability
of the neural model compared to classical approaches. This paper proposes
ColBERTer, a neural retrieval model using contextualized late interaction
(ColBERT) with enhanced reduction. Along the effectiveness Pareto frontier,
ColBERTer's reductions dramatically lower ColBERT's storage requirements while
simultaneously improving the interpretability of its token-matching scores. To
this end, ColBERTer fuses single-vector retrieval, multi-vector refinement, and
optional lexical matching components into one model. For its multi-vector
component, ColBERTer reduces the number of stored vectors per document by
learning unique whole-word representations for the terms in each document and
learning to identify and remove word representations that are not essential to
effective scoring. We employ an explicit multi-task, multi-stage training to
facilitate using very small vector dimensions. Results on the MS MARCO and
TREC-DL collection show that ColBERTer can reduce the storage footprint by up
to 2.5x, while maintaining effectiveness. With just one dimension per token in
its smallest setting, ColBERTer achieves index storage parity with the
plaintext size, with very strong effectiveness results. Finally, we demonstrate
ColBERTer's robustness on seven high-quality out-of-domain collections,
yielding statistically significant gains over traditional retrieval baselines.]]></summary>

actions, dubbed R(MA)^2B. The state of each arm evolves according to a
controlled Markov decision process (MDP), and the reward of pulling an arm
depends on both the current state of the corresponding MDP and the action
taken. The goal is to sequentially choose actions for arms so as to maximize
the expected value of the cumulative rewards collected. Since finding the
optimal policy is typically intractable, we propose a computationally appealing
index policy which we call Occupancy-Measured-Reward Index Policy. Our policy
is well-defined even if the underlying MDPs are not indexable. We prove that it
is asymptotically optimal when the activation budget and number of arms are
scaled up, while keeping their ratio as a constant. For the case when the
system parameters are unknown, we develop a learning algorithm. Our learning
algorithm uses the principle of optimism in the face of uncertainty and further
uses a generative model in order to fully exploit the structure of
Occupancy-Measured-Reward Index Policy. We call it the R(MA)^2B-UCB algorithm.
As compared with the existing algorithms, R(MA)^2B-UCB performs close to an
offline optimum policy, and also achieves a sub-linear regret with a low
computational complexity. Experimental results show that R(MA)^2B-UCB
outperforms the existing algorithms in both regret and run time.]]></summary>

resources. The efficiency of COVID-19 diagnosis has become highly significant.
As deep learning and convolutional neural network (CNN) has been widely
utilized and been verified in analyzing medical images, it has become a
powerful tool for computer-assisted diagnosis. However, there are two most
significant challenges in medical image classification with the help of deep
learning and neural networks, one of them is the difficulty of acquiring enough
samples, which may lead to model overfitting. Privacy concerns mainly bring the
other challenge since medical-related records are often deemed patients'
private information and protected by laws such as GDPR and HIPPA. Federated
learning can ensure the model training is decentralized on different devices
and no data is shared among them, which guarantees privacy. However, with data
located on different devices, the accessible data of each device could be
limited. Since transfer learning has been verified in dealing with limited data
with good performance, therefore, in this paper, We made a trial to implement
federated learning and transfer learning techniques using CNNs to classify
COVID-19 using lung CT scans. We also explored the impact of dataset
distribution at the client-side in federated learning and the number of
training epochs a model is trained. Finally, we obtained very high performance
with federated learning, demonstrating our success in leveraging accuracy and
privacy.]]></summary>

transformer scales quadratically with sequence length. Many efforts have been
made to develop more efficient transformer variants. A line of work (e.g.,
Linformer) projects the input sequence into a low-rank space, achieving linear
time complexity. However, Linformer does not suit well for text generation
tasks as the sequence length must be pre-specified. We propose MemSizer, an
approach also projects the source sequence into lower dimension representation
but can take input with dynamic length, with a different perspective of the
attention mechanism. MemSizer not only achieves the same linear time complexity
but also enjoys efficient recurrent-style autoregressive generation, which
yields constant memory complexity and reduced computation at inference. We
demonstrate that MemSizer provides an improved tradeoff between efficiency and

modeling and machine translation tasks, revealing a viable direction towards
further inference efficiency improvement.]]></summary>

consumption of the IoT networks, in the meanwhile, taking data freshness and
limited lifetime of IoT data into account. To better capture the
regional-different popularity distribution, we propose a hierarchical

adaptation with the MMD effective, we propose an intelligent dynamic strategy
for choosing the kernel bandwidth, which may be of independent interest even
outside of the confounded shift context. Finally, we show that our approach is
advantageous on a variety of synthetic and real datasets.]]></summary>

frequency-selective channels must operate based on a small number of pilot
symbols. This paper proposes novel channel prediction algorithms that address
this goal by integrating transfer and meta-learning with a reduced-rank
parametrization of the channel. The proposed methods optimize linear predictors
by utilizing data from previous frames, which are generally characterized by
distinct propagation characteristics, in order to enable fast training on the
time slots of the current frame. The proposed predictors rely on a novel
long-short-term decomposition (LSTD) of the linear prediction model that
leverages the disaggregation of the channel into long-term space-time
signatures and fading amplitudes. We first develop predictors for
single-antenna frequency-flat channels based on transfer/meta-learned quadratic
regularization. Then, we introduce transfer and meta-learning algorithms for
LSTD-based prediction models that build on equilibrium propagation (EP) and
alternating least squares (ALS). Numerical results under the 3GPP 5G standard
channel model demonstrate the impact of transfer and meta-learning on reducing
the number of pilots for channel prediction, as well as the merits of the
proposed LSTD parametrization.]]></summary>

state-of-the-art accuracy and capability for Natural Language Processing
applications. These models demand more computational power, storage, and
energy. Mokey reduces the footprint of state-of-the-art 32-bit or 16-bit
floating-point transformer models by quantizing all values to 4-bit indexes
into dictionaries of representative 16-bit fixed-point centroids. Mokey does
not need fine-tuning, an essential feature as often the training resources or
datasets are not available to many. Exploiting the range of values that
naturally occur in transformer models, Mokey selects centroid values to also
fit an exponential curve. This unique feature enables Mokey to replace the bulk
of the original multiply-accumulate operations with narrow 3b fixed-point
additions resulting in an area- and energy-efficient hardware accelerator
design. Over a set of state-of-the-art transformer models, the Mokey
accelerator delivers an order of magnitude improvements in energy efficiency
over a Tensor Cores-based accelerator while improving performance by at least
$4\times$ and as much as $15\times$ depending on the model and on-chip
buffering capacity. Optionally, Mokey can be used as a memory compression
assist for any other accelerator, transparently stashing wide floating-point or
fixed-point activations or weights into narrow 4-bit indexes. Mokey proves
superior to prior state-of-the-art quantization methods for Transformers.]]></summary>

in representation learning - the need for human annotations. As a result, SSL
holds the promise to learn representations from data in-the-wild, i.e., without
the need for finite and static datasets. Instead, true SSL algorithms should be
able to exploit the continuous stream of data being generated on the internet
or by agents exploring their environments. But do traditional self-supervised
learning approaches work in this setup? In this work, we investigate this
question by conducting experiments on the continuous self-supervised learning
problem. While learning in the wild, we expect to see a continuous (infinite)
non-IID data stream that follows a non-stationary distribution of visual
concepts. The goal is to learn a representation that can be robust, adaptive
yet not forgetful of concepts seen in the past. We show that a direct
application of current methods to such continuous setup is 1) inefficient both
computationally and in the amount of data required, 2) leads to inferior
representations due to temporal correlations (non-IID data) in some sources of
streaming data and 3) exhibits signs of catastrophic forgetting when trained on
sources with non-stationary data distributions. We propose the use of replay
buffers as an approach to alleviate the issues of inefficiency and temporal
correlations. We further propose a novel method to enhance the replay buffer by
maintaining the least redundant samples. Minimum redundancy (MinRed) buffers
allow us to learn effective representations even in the most challenging
streaming scenarios composed of sequential visual data obtained from a single
embodied agent, and alleviates the problem of catastrophic forgetting when
learning from data with non-stationary semantic distributions.]]></summary>

work on improving generalization of DML in settings like zero-shot retrieval,

the first to evaluate state-of-the-art DML methods trained on imbalanced data,

performance when used for downstream tasks. In this work, we first define
fairness in DML through an analysis of three properties of the representation

propose finDML, the fairness in non-balanced DML benchmark to characterize
representation fairness. Utilizing finDML, we find bias in DML representations
to propagate to common downstream classification tasks. Surprisingly, this bias
is propagated even when training data in the downstream task is re-balanced. To
address this problem, we present Partial Attribute De-correlation (PARADE) to
de-correlate feature representations from sensitive attributes and reduce

high-dimensional probability distributions offer significant theoretical
insights and practical advantages in numerous research areas. Recently, they
have gained popularity in machine learning as a tractable and scalable approach
for training probabilistic models and for statistically differentiating between
data distributions. Their advantages include: 1) They can be estimated from
data as statistical averages. 2) Such representations can leverage the ability
of neural networks to efficiently approximate optimal solutions in function
spaces. However, a systematic and practical approach to improving the tightness
of such variational formulas, and accordingly accelerate statistical learning
and estimation from data, is currently lacking. Here we develop such a
methodology for building new, tighter variational representations of
divergences. Our approach relies on improved objective functionals constructed
via an auxiliary optimization problem. Furthermore, the calculation of the
functional Hessian of objective functionals unveils the local curvature
differences around the common optimal variational solution; this quantifies and
orders the tightness gains between different variational representations.
Finally, numerical simulations utilizing neural network optimization
demonstrate that tighter representations can result in significantly faster
learning and more accurate estimation of divergences in both synthetic and real
datasets (of more than 1000 dimensions), often accelerated by nearly an order

well they perform. Without this frame of reference, the performance score of a
model is basically meaningless. What does it mean when a model achieves an
$F_1$ of 0.8 on a test set? A proper baseline is needed to evaluate the
`goodness' of a performance score. Comparing with the latest state-of-the-art
model is usually insightful. However, being state-of-the-art can change rapidly
when newer models are developed. Contrary to an advanced model, a simple dummy
classifier could be used. However, the latter could be beaten too easily,
making the comparison less valuable. This paper presents a universal baseline
method for all binary classification models, named the Dutch Draw (DD). This
approach weighs simple classifiers and determines the best classifier to use as
a baseline. We theoretically derive the DD baseline for many commonly used
evaluation measures and show that in most situations it reduces to (almost)
always predicting either zero or one. Summarizing, the DD baseline is: (1)
general, as it is applicable to all binary classification problems; (2) simple,
as it is quickly determined without training or parameter-tuning; (3)
informative, as insightful conclusions can be drawn from the results. The DD
baseline serves two purposes. First, to enable comparisons across research
papers by this robust and universal baseline. Secondly, to provide a sanity
check during the development process of a prediction model. It is a major
warning sign when a model is outperformed by the DD baseline.]]></summary>

regret bound of $\widetilde{O}\left( H^3 K^{\frac{2d}{2d+1}}\right)$, where $d$
is the covering dimension of the joint state-action space. This is the first
regret bound for kernel-based RL using smoothing kernels, which requires very
weak assumptions on the MDP and has been previously applied to a wide range of
tasks. We empirically validate our approach in continuous MDPs with sparse

synthesis (SVS) system named WeSinger. To improve the accuracy and naturalness
of synthesized singing voice, we design several specifical modules and
techniques: 1) A deep bi-directional LSTM based duration model with multi-scale
rhythm loss and post-processing step; 2) A Transformer-alike acoustic model
with progressive pitch-weighted decoder loss; 3) a 24 kHz pitch-aware LPCNet
neural vocoder to produce high-quality singing waveforms; 4) A novel data
augmentation method with multi-singer pre-training for stronger robustness and

the effectiveness of WeSinger in terms of accuracy and naturalness, and
WeSinger achieves state-of-the-art performance on the public corpus Opencpop.

themselves to be a powerful tool in all facets of society. However, due to
budget limitations, deliberate or non-deliberate censorship, and other problems
during data collection and curation, the labeled training set might exhibit a
systematic shortage of data for certain groups. We investigate a scenario in
which the absence of certain data is linked to the second level of a two-level
hierarchy in the data. Inspired by the idea of protected groups from
algorithmic fairness, we refer to the partitions carved by this second level as
"subgroups"; we refer to combinations of subgroups and classes, or leaves of
the hierarchy, as "sources". To characterize the problem, we introduce the
concept of classes with incomplete subgroup support. The representational bias
in the training set can give rise to spurious correlations between the classes
and the subgroups which render standard classification models ungeneralizable
to unseen sources. To overcome this bias, we make use of an additional, diverse
but unlabeled dataset, called the "deployment set", to learn a representation
that is invariant to subgroup. This is done by adversarially matching the
support of the training and deployment sets in representation space. In order
to learn the desired invariance, it is paramount that the sets of samples
observed by the discriminator are balanced by class; this is easily achieved
for the training set, but requires using semi-supervised clustering for the
deployment set. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method with experiments
on several datasets and variants of the problem.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In real-world applications, it is important and desirable to learn a model
that performs well on out-of-distribution (OOD) data. Recently, causality has
become a powerful tool to tackle the OOD generalization problem, with the idea
resting on the causal mechanism that is invariant across domains of interest.
To leverage the generally unknown causal mechanism, existing works assume a
linear form of causal feature or require sufficiently many and diverse training
domains, which are usually restrictive in practice. In this work, we obviate
these assumptions and tackle the OOD problem without explicitly recovering the
causal feature. Our approach is based on transformations that modify the
non-causal feature but leave the causal part unchanged, which can be either
obtained from prior knowledge or learned from the training data in the
multi-domain scenario. Under the setting of invariant causal mechanism, we
theoretically show that if all such transformations are available, then we can
learn a minimax optimal model across the domains using only single domain data.
Noticing that knowing a complete set of these causal invariant transformations
may be impractical, we further show that it suffices to know only a subset of
these transformations. Based on the theoretical findings, a regularized
training procedure is proposed to improve the OOD generalization capability.
Extensive experimental results on both synthetic and real datasets verify the
effectiveness of the proposed algorithm, even with only a few causal invariant
transformations.]]></summary>

enforcement in the AI industry would cause unbearable costs. When single data
deletion requests come, companies may need to delete the whole models learned
with massive resources. Existing works propose methods to remove knowledge
learned from data for explicitly parameterized models, which however are not
appliable to the sampling-based Bayesian inference, i.e., Markov chain Monte
Carlo (MCMC), as MCMC can only infer implicit distributions. In this paper, we
propose the first machine unlearning algorithm for MCMC. We first convert the
MCMC unlearning problem into an explicit optimization problem. Based on this
problem conversion, an {\it MCMC influence function} is designed to provably
characterize the learned knowledge from data, which then delivers the MCMC
unlearning algorithm. Theoretical analysis shows that MCMC unlearning would not
compromise the generalizability of the MCMC models. Experiments on Gaussian

feedback representation consisting of an open-loop sequence, and an associated

that this alternate approach results in highly efficient training, the answers
obtained are repeatable and hence reliable, and the resulting closed

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We study a finite-horizon restless multi-armed bandit problem with multiple
actions, dubbed R(MA)^2B. The state of each arm evolves according to a
controlled Markov decision process (MDP), and the reward of pulling an arm
depends on both the current state of the corresponding MDP and the action
taken. The goal is to sequentially choose actions for arms so as to maximize
the expected value of the cumulative rewards collected. Since finding the
optimal policy is typically intractable, we propose a computationally appealing
index policy which we call Occupancy-Measured-Reward Index Policy. Our policy
is well-defined even if the underlying MDPs are not indexable. We prove that it
is asymptotically optimal when the activation budget and number of arms are
scaled up, while keeping their ratio as a constant. For the case when the
system parameters are unknown, we develop a learning algorithm. Our learning
algorithm uses the principle of optimism in the face of uncertainty and further
uses a generative model in order to fully exploit the structure of
Occupancy-Measured-Reward Index Policy. We call it the R(MA)^2B-UCB algorithm.
As compared with the existing algorithms, R(MA)^2B-UCB performs close to an
offline optimum policy, and also achieves a sub-linear regret with a low
computational complexity. Experimental results show that R(MA)^2B-UCB
outperforms the existing algorithms in both regret and run time.]]></summary>

for dealing with unreliable data. Aggregate ratings are more reliable than
individual ones. However, many natural language processing (NLP) applications

reliability is under-reported, and a proposed k-rater reliability (kRR) should
be used as the correct data reliability for aggregated datasets. It is a
multi-rater generalization of inter-rater reliability (IRR). We conducted two

observations of multiple trajectories of those systems, with finite sample

linear system identification rely on observations of steady state behaviors
from a single long trajectory, and are not applicable to unstable systems. In
contrast, we consider the scenario of learning system dynamics based on
multiple short trajectories, where there are no easily observed steady state
behaviors. We provide a finite sample analysis, which shows that the dynamics
can be learned at a rate $\mathcal{O}(\frac{1}{\sqrt{N}})$ for both stable and
unstable systems, where $N$ is the number of trajectories, when the initial
state of the system has zero mean (which is a common assumption in the existing
literature). We further generalize our result to the case where the initial
state has non-zero mean. We show that one can adjust the length of the
trajectories to achieve a learning rate of
$\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{\frac{\log{N}}{N})}$ for strictly stable systems and a
learning rate of $\mathcal{O}(\frac{(\log{N})^d}{\sqrt{N}})$ for marginally

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Transformer-based language models (TLMs) provide state-of-the-art performance
in many modern natural language processing applications. TLM training is
conducted in two phases. First, the model is pre-trained over large volumes of
text to minimize a generic objective function, such as the Masked Language
Model (MLM). Second, the model is fine-tuned in specific downstream tasks.
Pre-training requires large volumes of data and high computational resources,
while introducing many still unresolved design choices. For instance, selecting
hyperparameters for language model pre-training is often carried out based on
heuristics or grid-based searches. In this work, we propose a multi-armed
bandit-based online optimization framework for the sequential selection of
pre-training hyperparameters to optimize language model performance. We pose
the pre-training procedure as a sequential decision-making task, where at each
pre-training step, an agent must determine what hyperparameters to use towards
optimizing the pre-training objective. We propose a Thompson sampling bandit
algorithm, based on a surrogate Gaussian process reward model of the MLM
pre-training objective, for its sequential minimization. We empirically show
how the proposed Gaussian process based Thompson sampling pre-trains robust and
well-performing language models. Namely, by sequentially selecting masking
hyperparameters of the TLM, we achieve satisfactory performance in less epochs,
not only in terms of the pre-training MLM objective, but in diverse downstream
fine-tuning tasks. The proposed bandit-based technique provides an automated
hyperparameter selection method for pre-training TLMs of interest to
practitioners. In addition, our results indicate that, instead of MLM
pre-training with fixed masking probabilities, sequentially adapting the
masking hyperparameters improves both pre-training loss and downstream task
metrics.]]></summary>

emergence of an extended critical regime without fine-tuning parameters. In
this extended critical regime, DNNs exhibit rich and complex propagation
dynamics across layers. We further elucidate that the extended criticality
endows DNNs with profound computational advantages: balancing the contraction

two views by finding maximally correlated linear projections of them. Several
variants of CCA have been introduced in the literature, in particular, variants
based on deep neural networks for learning highly correlated nonlinear

their learnable parameters remain independent of the inputs after the training
process, which may limit their capacity for learning highly correlated
representations. We introduce a novel dynamic scaling method for training an
input-dependent canonical correlation model. In our deep-CCA models, the
parameters of the last layer are scaled by a second neural network that is
conditioned on the model's input, resulting in a parameterization that is
dependent on the input samples. We evaluate our model on multiple datasets and
demonstrate that the learned representations are more correlated in comparison
to the conventionally-parameterized CCA-based models and also obtain preferable

dependency structures. Humans and other intelligent agents do not waste time
assessing the utility of every high-level action in existence, but instead only
consider ones they deem possible in the first place. By focusing only on what
is feasible, or "afforded", at the present moment, an agent can spend more time
both evaluating the utility of and acting on what matters. To this end, we
present Hierarchical Affordance Learning (HAL), a method that learns a model of
hierarchical affordances in order to prune impossible subtasks for more
effective learning. Existing works in hierarchical reinforcement learning
provide agents with structural representations of subtasks but are not
affordance-aware, and by grounding our definition of hierarchical affordances
in the present state, our approach is more flexible than the multitude of
approaches that ground their subtask dependencies in a symbolic history. While
these logic-based methods often require complete knowledge of the subtask
hierarchy, our approach is able to utilize incomplete and varying symbolic
specifications. Furthermore, we demonstrate that relative to
non-affordance-aware methods, HAL agents are better able to efficiently learn
complex tasks, navigate environment stochasticity, and acquire diverse skills

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bayesian optimization is a gold standard for query-efficient continuous
optimization. However, its adoption for drug and antibody sequence design has
been hindered by the discrete, high-dimensional nature of the decision
variables. We develop a new approach (LaMBO) which jointly trains a denoising
autoencoder with a discriminative multi-task Gaussian process head, enabling
gradient-based optimization of multi-objective acquisition functions in the
latent space of the autoencoder. These acquisition functions allow LaMBO to
balance the explore-exploit trade-off over multiple design rounds, and to
balance objective tradeoffs by optimizing sequences at many different points on
the Pareto frontier. We evaluate LaMBO on a small-molecule task based on the
ZINC dataset and introduce a new large-molecule task targeting fluorescent
proteins. In our experiments, LaMBO outperforms genetic optimizers and does not
require a large pretraining corpus, demonstrating that Bayesian optimization is
practical and effective for biological sequence design.]]></summary>

Recently when working on a WorldModels implementation for keras.io I realized that I needed a genetic algorithm implementation to train the "controller" module. Instead of writing a one off solution, I decided to write Keras Genetic, a full package to train keras models using genetic algorithms.
 Please note genetic algorithms are not good for training neural networks outside of some niche use cases; typically training a controller with <1k parameters. The ConvNet MNIST example scores *horribly* when compared to comparable backprop examples.
 Please give the package a try and let me know if you find this interesting or useful:

 For a personal project, I intend to develop a little CNN - TransposeCNN model to colorize images of portraits. The idea is simply, from a grayscale image, to give the RGB version. To do so, I constructed a dataset of colored portraits and I would like to use the keras' ImageDataGenerator tool to specify that the feature to be the grayscale version and the label the original one.
 I could simply duplicate the current dataset and convert one of them into grayscales, and that may be easier to do, but then I would like to do something else :
 I would like to apply the same data augmentation functions from ImageDataGenerator (rotations, flipping... ) to the features and their corresponding labels.
 Do you know if it is possible or will I have to construct the augmented dataset explicitely ?
 Thank you for your advice

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[According to the original "Attention is all you need" paper (Section 6), for the base models, they used a single model obtained by averaging the last 5 checkpoints, which were written at 10-minute intervals. For the big models, we averaged the last 20 checkpoints. 
 Is it about improving the performance? But if other works didn't do the checkpoint averaging, it wouldn't be a fair comparision. However, I seldom see the recently transformer works highlighting this technique.
 What's more, I have not heard any ViT (Vision Transformer) works utilizing such a checkpoint averaging trick. My background is computer vision so I was wondering if it makes sense to try this...
 Could someone provide some guidance on this? Thanks.

 I see two improvements to simple averaging of the features:
  
Add an average pooling layer and train the network end-to-end.
 Add a weighted average pooling layer and train the network end-to-end
  
Are there any ways that I can do better here? I am under sample size limitations, samples per class can be as low as 20, total data set size under 300, with 2-3 classes.
 I've tried method 1. and it barely changes the classification accuracy.

 In the example above, I've actually a 2600X for the last 2 years and am considering to buy a 5600X, wait until AM5 CPU later this year, or switch back to Intel 12600K although Intel is at least $200 more because their MB are overpriced. It would be nice to know whether it would save me incredible amount of time so I can justify getting more experience quicker or if it's marginal and to save the money on a nice 3080 GPU, etc. and get into Deep Learning sooner.

 Modern language models like T5 or GPT-3 achieve remarkably low perplexities on both training and validation data, yet when sampling from their output distributions, the generated text often seems dull and uninteresting. Various workarounds have been proposed, such as top-k sampling and nucleus sampling, but while these manage to somewhat improve the generated samples, they are hacky and unfounded. This paper introduces typical sampling, a new decoding method that is principled, effective, and can be implemented efficiently. Typical sampling turns away from sampling purely based on likelihood and explicitly finds a trade-off between generating high-probability samples and generating high-information samples. The paper connects typical sampling to psycholinguistic theories on human speech generation, and shows experimentally that typical sampling achieves much more diverse and interesting results than any of the current methods.

 I hope this is the right subreddit...

 I have the following information:
 Given information 
 The table is the given dataset and the tree is the resulting tree. I am trying to understand how the calculated Entropy values came to place, since I get different answers when I try it myself. 
 This is my way (for example for "level"):
 p1 (Senior) = 5/14
 p2 (Mid) = 4/14
 p3 (Junior) = 5/14
 Entropy = -(5/14*log_2(5/14)+4/14*log_2(4/14)+5/14*log_2(5/14)) = 1.577 (which makes no sense, since Entropy should be between 0 and 1??)
 Thanks a lot for any help!

 I'd say for computer vision, in most cases, a Resnet / EfficientNet would get a good result, given enough data. 
 In NLP, if it's about something very simple, Naive Bayes methods can be decent. If the task is harder, BERT would do the trick up to a certain level for many tasks
 However, choosing the first model is not obvious for many graph-related tasks where a node has more than 1 feature. For example, in node classification problems, what's a model easy to implement that guarantees decent results?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have proved to be effective in a wide range of issues and fields. GNNs commonly use a message-passing mechanism, in which nodes communicate feature representations (“messages”) to their neighbors at each layer. Each node’s feature representation is initialized to its original features, and it is updated by aggregating incoming messages from neighbors on a regular basis. GNNs are distinguished from other purely topological learning systems such as random walks or label propagation by their ability to mix topological and feature information, which is arguably what contributes to their success.
 Typically, GNN models assume a fully observed feature matrix, with rows representing nodes and columns representing channels. In real-world circumstances, however, each trait is frequently only observable for a subset of nodes. Demographic information, for example, maybe exposed to only a small percentage of social network users, while content features are typically only available to the most active users.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[TorchMetrics is a really nice and convenient library that lets us compute the performance of models in an iterative fashion. It's designed with PyTorch (and PyTorch Lightning) in mind, but it is a general-purpose library compatible with other libraries and workflows. This iterative computation is useful if we want to track a model during iterative training or evaluation on minibatches (and optionally across on multiple GPUs). In deep learning, that's essentially all the time. However, when using TorchMetrics, one common question is whether we should use .update() or .forward()? (And that's also a question I certainly had when I started using it.). Here's a hands-on example and explanation.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I came across this Twitter thread which shows some interesting results when trying to recolor historical photos that have been decolored. The recolored photos are a lot drabber than the original, and the thread author says that this gives us a skewed view of the past, making us think the past was a lot more boring than it was, downplaying how vibrant and diverse certain societies were.
 https://preview.redd.it/fctveek4cjp81.png?width=3064&format=png&auto=webp&s=9aadecef7c12a4dd13f5197a69ffd155084be75e
 This made me think of some questions that I thought could lead to a good discussion here. I've put some below in no particular order!
  
Do you think that expert opinion should be consulted in the Machine Learning process more? If so, where? (perhaps omitting Expert Systems)
 Is there too much faith that a result from an ML model is the "right" result? (a phenomenon that maybe isn't specific to ML but a result of human tendencies?)
 Do ML practitioners have a responsibility to clearly communicate to the general public the limitations and degree-of-confidence in these systems?
 Am I reading too much into this, and this colorization model is just a fun model to play with, and the conclusions of the Twitter thread are too speculative or conjectural?
 Is this colorization issue just another form of bias that needs to be ironed out?
 The thread concludes by saying that colorization should be left to experts who can use context to pick accurate colors. I think this is too extreme, and that ML systems can incorporate expertise when training, or after during evaluation. Do you think there are any jobs/problems that ML methods could be applied to but should be left to experts (some considerations might be safety, privacy, ethics, etc.)
  
I know that ultimately a lot of these questions can simply boil down to statistics and their interpretation, so I'm not sure exactly where discussion could/should/will lead, but I'm looking forward to hearing your opinions :)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The amount of money and energy necessary to train AI models has become a hot-button issue as they grow in size. Leaders in the AI field have been pouring money towards training increasingly bigger models since GPT-3 proved the considerable gains in performance that can be achieved by merely increasing model size. However, this is prohibitively expensive, necessitates tremendous computational resources, consumes enormous energy, and is becoming more recognized as an issue, not just because of the environmental implications, but also because it makes it harder for smaller AI companies to compete, concentrating power in the hands of industry titans. A new technique that rewrites one of the discipline’s core building pieces could give a workaround.
 Oxford University researchers have proposed a novel method that might cut training time in half. This is accomplished by redesigning backpropagation, one of the essential components of today’s neural network-based AI systems. Backpropagation has remained a mainstay of machine learning for computing gradients of objective functions for optimization. Backpropagation, also known as reverse-mode differentiation, is a subset of the general family of automatic differentiation algorithms that includes forward mode differentiation. A method for computing gradients based purely on the directional derivative, which may be done in the forward mode with precision and efficiency, is designed. The method is known as the forward gradient, which is an unbiased estimate of the gradient that can be assessed in a single forward run of the function, obviating the necessity for backpropagation in gradient descent completely.

 This is an interview with Junnan Li and Dongxu Li, authors of BLIP and members of Salesforce research.
 Cross-modal pre-training has been all the rage lately in deep learning, especially training vision and language models together. However, there are a number of issues, such as low quality datasets that limit the performance of any model trained on it, and also the fact that pure contrastive pre-training cannot be easily fine-tuned for most downstream tasks. BLIP unifies different tasks and objectives in a single pre-training run and achieves a much more versatile model, which the paper immediately uses to create, filter, clean and thus bootstrap its own dataset to improve performance even more!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[To learn visual representations, self-attention-based models, particularly vision transformers, offer an alternative to convolutional neural networks (CNNs). ViT breaks an image into a series of non-overlapping patches and then uses multi-headed self-attention in transformers to learn interpatch representations. The typical trend in ViT networks is to increase the number of parameters to improve performance.
 These gains in performance come at the expense of model size (network parameters) and latency. Many real-world applications (such as augmented reality and autonomous wheelchairs) necessitate the timely execution of visual recognition tasks (such as object detection and semantic segmentation) on resource-constrained mobile devices.
 ViT models for such jobs should be light-weight and quick to be effective. ViT models’ performance is much inferior to light-weight CNNs, even when the model size is reduced to fit the resource limits of mobile devices. DeIT, for example, is 3% less accurate than MobileNetv3 for a parameter budget of roughly 5-6 million. As a result, designing light-weight ViT models is critical.
 Many mobile vision tasks have been powered by light-weight CNNs. ViT-based networks, on the other hand, are still a long way from being utilized on such devices. Unlike light-weight CNNs that are simple to optimize and integrate with task-specific networks, ViTs are large (e.g., ViT-B/16 vs. MobileNetv3: 86 vs. 7.5 million parameters), difficult to optimize, require extensive data augmentation and L2 regularisation to avoid over-fitting, and require expensive decoders for downstream tasks, particularly dense prediction tasks.

 The following notebook demonstrates a method to provide explainability for semantic search. This method masks/replaces each token for a search result to determine the importance of each term for a query. The score is then compared with the score for the full text to determine how much of a delta the permutation caused.

 I'm a PhD researcher at the University of Bristol in the UK, focussing on Human-In-The-Loop AI. I (and the others in my group) work a lot in XAI and tricky, grey-area ethical issues. Currently I'm researching how different groups, including those familiar with AI, view AI in high-stakes settings.
 As part of this I'm trying to find people to take part in my survey: 
 https://forms.office.com/r/xVFu2f8qrJ
 It takes about 3m on average to complete, and there's the option to enter a raffle for one of four £25 Amazon vouchers. All of your data is completely anonymous, and the raffle is separated from the questions, so there's no way that I can associate your answers with your email. 
 If you have any questions feel free to drop them in the comments!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello all,
 An idea for modelling long-range interactions in CNNs came to my mind, and I thought to share it with you folks and seek your opinions. 
 On a high level, it functions akin to squeeze-and-excitation, with the chief difference being instead of calibrating channel-wise features, it operates on spatial features. Concretely, assume we start with a 3 X 256 X 256 tensor; the first step is to squeeze the channels via a convolution to get a 256 X 256 tensor. However, owing to the computational costs of the multilayer perceptron that is about to be described, it is necessary to downscale the spatial dimensions, which can be done by setting the convolution's kernel size and stride to, say, 16 (i.e., the input is being "patchified"). The resulting 16 X 16 matrix is flattened to yield a 25…]]></summary>

 Newbie here! 
 I am attempting to pre-train a custom policy in stable baselines. The policy takes multiple inputs, each with a different shape. 
 I tried using this as reference https://colab.research.google.com/github/Stable-Baselines-Team/rl-colab-notebooks/blob/sb3/pretraining.ipynb#scrollTo=toKEQE9i8aof but failed miserably. 
 Has anyone successfully pretrained a multi input? Would love some guidance.
 Currently each of my observations are stored as a list of lists with different sizes.. For example [ list of size(7), list of size(3)...] where each list is one of the inputs.
 Thank you!

 Not to say that Python does not edge out at some places. Like having lots of libraries for almost everything, being multi-functional and huge community.
 But yet, I enjoy R more than Python. I personally find that I can get most of work done quickly in R.
 Or is it because I've been working with R, that I'm better at it!?

 It takes your AI model as input and outputs an optimized version that runs 5-20 times faster on your hardware. In other words, nebullvm tests multiple deep learning compilers to identify the best possible way to execute your model on your specific machine, without impacting the accuracy of your model.
 And that's it. In just a few lines of code.
 And a big thank you to everyone for supporting this open-source project! The library received 250+ Github stars⭐ on release day, and that's just amazing 🚀

Directly after finishing my Ph.D. I started working as a data scientist in the financial service industry. However, my goal is to move into a pure tech company and hopefully work as a research data scientist or a research scientist. Recently I have been offered a 2-year postdoc in ML in a good group in Europe. I am considering taking this postdoc since I get more time to do "pure" research (and to complete some of the research from my Ph.D.). Thus, would it make sense to take this postdoc with a lower salary (and worse work-life balance) for a few years if the goal is to get a "research" job in the industry, or would I be better of to try to "climb the ladder" from my current data science job?
 PS: I am new to this subreddit so I hope this post is ok.

That such risk factors could be extracted from fundus photos was a novel discovery and thus a surprising outcome to clinicians and laypersons alike. Since then, we and other researchers have discovered additional novel biomarkers from fundus photos, such as markers for chronic kidney disease and diabetes, and hemoglobin levels to detect anemia.

 It might be of interest that I created a Python implementation of IncrementalDBSCAN.
 The repository, including documentation, is here: https://github.com/DataOmbudsman/incdbscan
 And this is the original paper: https://www.dbs.ifi.lmu.de/Publikationen/Papers/VLDB-98-IncDBSCAN.pdf
 The paper (from the authors of DBSCAN) describes how to make DBSCAN work with an incremental strategy, in which one can add new data points to an already existing clustering and doesn't have to re-cluster every data point. I couldn't find any implementation of the algorithm so I ended up writing my own one. I'm glad it's actually working and has a lot of unit tests covering common and special cases. The performance gain (vs reclustering with DBSCAN) is not huge though, could be worked on more. 
 Happy to take any feedback!

Has anyone tried making a transformer-based reply bot or chatbot that responds to both images and text, like how a person would be able to chat in messaging apps? I thought about this because I figured tweet generation models would be much more interesting if they could also generate replies instead of standalone tweets, and replies by tweeters more often than not are replies to tweets with images. 
 I was thinking not only do you need an image-to-text model, you probably also need finetuning data that includes an image-to-text model? I guess understanding context would be major obstacle.
 Thanks!

I most likely want to go for a PhD because I enjoy thinking about challenging problems and trying out new things. My dream job would be to work as a research scientist in the industry, which would guarantee a good salary (as opposed to academia), applied value in the research I do, and some creativity. Currently, I am considering different research avenues while keeping in mind a potential trade-off between utility, potential to be creative, intrinsic motivation, and future job prospects. While intrinsic motivation is definitely important to me, I really see a PhD as an investment in my future. That is, I want my job prospects to signficantly improvea after completing it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello all,
 After 1 year working extensively with GPT models (GPT-3, GPT-J, and GPT-NeoX), I think I now have a good view on what these NLP models are capable of. It appears that many traditional NLP tasks can now be achieved thanks to these large language models thanks to few-shot learning (aka "prompting", or "prompt engineering").
 NER is a very good candidate because, thanks to these models, it is possible to extract any type of entity without ever annotating and training a new model. Annotation has always been a challenge that has caused many entity extraction projects to simply fail, because it is a long and tedious process.
 In this article, I'm showing how easy it is to perform NER thanks to GPT and few-shot learning, without any annotation process: https://nlpcloud.io/few-shot-ner-entity-extraction-without-annotation-training-based-on-gpt.html
 If you also experimented with entity extraction with GPT models, I would love to hear your thoughts. Are you, like I am, impressed by the results? And do you think it means that annotation is a thing from the past?
 Thanks!

 Basically i need to create a neural net from scratch in c# for intent classification. I have modelled the neurons as a class with attributes : weights(moddelled as an array, each value is a weight for a branch connecting to the neuron) a , a value(result after the activation),and a bias(a different bias per neuron. 
 My question is that , my input will be an array of words, obviously hashed or something so it has a numerical value, each value in the array will be multiplied by the weight. Is the bias added to each of these values and then the activation function applied to each value in the array, OR is it that the activation is applied to the array there is one value as an output and the bias is added to that.
 thank you any help appreciated , if more info is needed then please ask.

Neuroscientists like Stanislas Dehaene at Collège de France, Moira Dillon at New York University, and Josh Tenenbaum at MIT are exploring whether human ability to reason about geometric shapes like squares and rectangles are part of what makes humans special. Dehaene said. “I love the progress in A.I. It’s very impressive. But I believe that there is a deep aspect missing, which is symbol processing”. Yoshua Bengio, at the Université de Montréal, agreed that state-of-the-art machine learning lacks something related to symbols or abstract reasoning. It’s not impossible to do abstract reasoning with neural networks, Bengio said, “it’s just that we don’t know yet how to do it.” It’s an indication, Bengio said, of where A.I. research needs to go.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Extracting knowledge and actionable insights by manually processing hundreds of terabytes of data downlinked from satellites to data centers has become difficult.
 Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imaging is a type of active remote sensing in which a satellite sends microwave radar wave pulses down to the Earth’s surface. These radar signals return to the satellite after reflecting off the Earth and any objects. A SAR image is created by processing these pulses over time and space, with each pixel representing the superposition of multiple radar scatters. Radar waves penetrate clouds and illuminate the Earth’s surface even during nights because the satellite is actively creating them.
 They produce visual that is sometimes contradictory and incompatible with modern computer vision systems. Three common effects are polarisation, layover, and multi-path.
  
The layover effect occurs when radar beams reach the top of a structure before reaching the bottom. This causes the top of the object to appear to be overlapping with the bottom. 
 When radar waves reflect off objects on the ground and bounce numerous times before returning to the SAR sensor, this is known as multi-path effects. Multi-path effects cause things in the picture to appear in multiple transformations in the final image.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello, long time lurker here. I've applied to a hackathlon where the goal is to implement an AI for a 1v1 turn based game and was hoping to hear some thoughts, suggestions, recommendations.
 The game itself will be simple, likely a turn based board game. The AIs battle each other to win the competition. Last year's competition had a simplified version of Catan.
 I have taken some university courses in the AI field (AI 101, Machine learning, Soft Computing etc.) and am familiar with basic concepts, but I don't know much about RL (I have a general notion on what it's about). I was hoping to learn more about it some day and this competition seems like a perfect opportunity. 
 I'm looking to prepare a bit before the competition and started exploring reinforcement learning methods and frameworks. Is there a framework which would be suitable for this? A framework which has an interface for a custom game that I can build?
 Could Q learning be used in environments where there is more than one agent? Are there some methods to learn the best heuristic for the minmax algorithm?

The paper explaining it is super basic, which is not what you'd expect from the people who finally solved poker. It has entire pages dedicated to illustrations about the game theory of tic-tac-toe
 
I've seen people arguing about whether it's merely counting cards (which isn't the same as out-strategizing humans)
 
Their metrics for success seem questionable, like they have a graph of cumulative chips won that goes up - which seems great but would also happen if some of the human pros could still outperform it on average
 
 What is the actual best we've done at teaching computers poker strategy?

For many of us, it can be challenging to keep up with the volume of documents that arrive in our inboxes every day: reports, reviews, briefs, policies and the list goes on. When a new document is received, readers often wish it included a brief summary of the main points in order to effectively prioritize it. However, composing a document summary can be cognitively challenging and time-consuming, especially when a document writer is starting from scratch.

 Cross-modal pre-training has been all the rage lately in deep learning, especially training vision and language models together. However, there are a number of issues, such as low quality datasets that limit the performance of any model trained on it, and also the fact that pure contrastive pre-training cannot be easily fine-tuned for most downstream tasks. BLIP unifies different tasks and objectives in a single pre-training run and achieves a much more versatile model, which the paper immediately uses to create, filter, clean and thus bootstrap its own dataset to improve performance even more!

 Here's what I've considered so far:
  
Hugging Face (Gradio) - the VQGAN_CLIP model is down, which doesn't instill confidence...
 Docker, cog, and replicate.com - it doesn't seem to have API capability.
 RunwayML - they seem to be pivoting away from such a service.
 NodeJS and some cloud hosting service (Amazon?) - may be complex to set up, are there any straightforward tutorials to host say VQGAN+CLIP? Would the process be different for a diffusion model?
  
How do tools like WOMBO host their models? Anyone have advice before I start going down a dead end?
 I have some software engineering and machine learning experience, but none with deployment.
 Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A regular SMS message sent from a business – like a promotion or a welcome message – is a common one-way communication. A chatbot, instead, provides a two-way conversation: it can ask questions, process the answer, and continue the communicational path to subscribe, qualify leads and even sell. 
 But here are things to keep in mind:
  
You'll pay for every message.
 You should also keep in mind the character limit. A single SMS message should include no more than 160 characters encoded using the GSM-7 character set.
 If using SMS, you’ll also need to update relevant legal pages like terms of service and privacy policy, with details on how SMS consent will be handled.
 Many countries may have additional regulations. For the US, all SMS messaging in The United States of America is governed by the CTIA – The Wireless Association.
 Another point is media limits. SMS does not allow sending videos or attachments. You may send an image with an MMS but keep in mind the cost of it is different than for a text-only SMS. 
  
Overall, there are more benefits to SMS chatbots, and if you've been thinking on them for a long time, here's a guide to help you starting out https://botscrew.com/blog/sms-chatbot-a-complete-guide-for-business-use-cases/?utm_source=Reddit&utm_medium=artificial&utm_campaign=44643&utm_term=&utm_content=

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Let me start this by saying I am a complete rookie on neural networks. I had one semester when we touched on them and I did a project that involved one. Beyond that, my skill is very limited. Now I am out of school and want to improve on my project. Looking for some expert advice. 
 My project was based on the program found here:
 Price-Forecaster/Stock-RNN-Deep-Learning-TechIndicators.ipynb at master · marcosan93/Price-Forecaster · GitHub 
 I posted an issue and someone added the comment that the programmer has not split the data to X-train,X-test, y-train,y-test so the model will be always biased due to peek ahead. I added early stopping to the program to help with overfitting. Am I understanding things right on where would you add splitting the data? Would you split the data before running the network and use the training data in the epochs, run the network, then recall the best weights for your test set? Just unsure how you do this when the accuracy of the test set may be garbage. 
 My goal is to send a list of stocks through the network, then give me a "report" at the end that shows which stock is most likely to meet or exceed its prediction. Would this just be a confidence interval? Ideally, I would include a goal return and it would say which stock was most likely to reach that return. Since each stock has its own cycles, I was planning to run each stock through the network to find the individual weights. Any advice on this section?
 I hope you can help with some advice. I'd love to see how well my added code ideas would do. Thanks.

 I am trying vanilla policy gradient algorithm of gym's bipedal walker. My algorithm was not converging so I added lstm to the network. I expected that somehow the agent will use the memory to converge even faster but after adding it I observed that LSTM is somehow making the agent worse. Below are the graphs of without and with lstm.

 with lstm

 orange-with lstm and yellow-without lstm
 Can anyone explain to me why is this happening?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[GitHub: https://github.com/muxamilian/wysiwyh
 WYSIWHY is a neural network that transforms an input video into an audio sequence in real time. It does so by compressing each image using an autoencoder and interpreting the resulting code as a frequency range.
 This could potentially be useful for the visually impaired, helping with indoor navigation. It could also be used to transform an infrared or ultraviolet video to sound and thus enable one to perceive otherwise invisible colors.
 Demo; recommended with sound turned on
 In a usual autoencoder, the elements of the code vector are independent of each other. This makes subtle differences between adjacent elements of the code vector hard to perceive for humans. The resulting audio sequence would sound like indistinguishable white noise. For WYSIWYH thus an encoder is used which hierarchically structures the code, meaning that large differences in the input image result in large differences in the output code. This also results in adjacent elements of the code vector being correlated. This makes the autoencoder’s code more friendly to human perception.
 Overall approach

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), with their capacity of producing high-quality images, have been the leading technology in image generation for the past couple of years. Nevertheless, their minimax learning mechanism brought out different limits, such as training instability and mode collapse (i.e., when all the produced samples belong to a small set of samples).
 Recently, Generative Transformer models are beginning to match, or even surpass, the performances of GANs. The simple idea is to learn a function to encode the input image into a quantized sequence and then train an autoregressive Transformer on a sequence prediction task (i.e., predict an image token, given all the previous image tokens). This learning is based on maximum likelihood and thus not affected by the same issue…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey there! 👋
 I'm Thomas Simonini from Hugging Face 🤗. I work on building tools, environments and integrating RL libraries to empower researchers and RL enthusiasts. I was wondering how Hugging Face can be useful to you in the Deep Reinforcement Learning Ecosystem? What do you need as RL researcher/enthusiast/engineer and how we can help you?
 For now:
  
We integrated Stable-baselines3 to the Hub** such that you can: 
 Easily host and test your saved models.
 Load powerful, trained models from the community

We're currently integrating more libraries (RL-Zoo, CleanRL...)
 We're working on building tools that allow you to generate a replay video of your agent and test it.
 We're building open-source RL environments such as snowball-fight
 And finally, we're working on state of the art's research with Decision Transformers, Embodied environments, etc.
  
But I would love to know what do you need as RL researcher/enthusiast/engineer and how we can help you?
 Thanks for your feedback,

The extension to multiple frequencies is called, unsurprisingly, Multiple Frequency Shift Keying (MFSK). What is surprising is how MFSK sounds. When I first heard MFSK I immediately recognized it as an […]

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I use the [RL Robotics library](https://github.com/Farama-Foundation/Gym-Robotics) to simulate robots. In the Fetchxxx-Env, the variable distance_threshold is set as 0.05 default to determine whether it completed successfully a task. I try to change it by using 
 env.distance_threshold = 0.01(or other value) 
 Because I think 0.05(m) is too rough for some tasks. But it doesn't work! (When the success_rate is 1.0, the distance between the achieved_goal and the desired_goal is 0.04x, which is larger than I set.) 
 What should I do to change the conditions for determining whether a task is complete? Can anyone give me some advice or information?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello,
 I'm an undergraduate CS student trying to re-implement this paper for my University project.
 I have some experience in Machine Learning (Supervised Learning) and implemented some basic projects myself, but I'm a little bit confused about where to begin, I've found two different implementations online but I don't think that's gonna help me a lot as I'm not that experienced in this field.
 I would appreciate any suggestions on how I can understand the paper and implement it myself (not just a copy/paste from someone else's code) or the libraries that can help me, etc.
 Sorry for my bad English, I'm not a native speaker
 thanks a lot :)
