Experimentally, Nosie2Sim recovers intrinsic\nfeatures from noisy low-dose CT and photon-counting CT images as effectively as\nor even better than supervised learning methods on practical datasets visually,\nquantitatively and statistically.

Relative\nto conventional communications, up to 36 dB interference suppression for a\nchannel reuse of four can be achieved by the AE communications with\ninterference training and randomized smoothing.

          "description": "Deep learning has achieved great success in many applications. However, its\ndeployment in practice has been hurdled by two issues: the privacy of data that\nhas to be aggregated centrally for model training and high communication\noverhead due to transmission of a large amount of data usually geographically\ndistributed. Addressing both issues is challenging and most existing works\ncould not provide an efficient solution. In this paper, we develop FedPC, a\nFederated Deep Learning Framework for Privacy Preservation and Communication\nEfficiency. The framework allows a model to be learned on multiple private\ndatasets while not revealing any information of training data, even with\nintermediate data. The framework also minimizes the amount of data exchanged to\nupdate the model. We formally prove the convergence of the learning model when\ntraining with FedPC and its privacy-preserving property. We perform extensive\nexperiments to evaluate the performance of FedPC in terms of the approximation\nto the upper-bound performance (when training centrally) and communication\noverhead. The results show that FedPC maintains the performance approximation\nof the models within $8.5\\%$ of the centrally-trained models when data is\ndistributed to 10 computing nodes. FedPC also reduces the communication\noverhead by up to $42.20\\%$ compared to existing works.",

          "description": "Advances in deep learning have enabled a wide range of promising\napplications. However, these systems are vulnerable to Adversarial Machine\nLearning (AML) attacks; adversarially crafted perturbations to their inputs\ncould cause them to misclassify. Several state-of-the-art adversarial attacks\nhave demonstrated that they can reliably fool classifiers making these attacks\na significant threat. Adversarial attack generation algorithms focus primarily\non creating successful examples while controlling the noise magnitude and\ndistribution to make detection more difficult. The underlying assumption of\nthese attacks is that the adversarial noise is generated offline, making their\nexecution time a secondary consideration. However, recently, just-in-time\nadversarial attacks where an attacker opportunistically generates adversarial\nexamples on the fly have been shown to be possible. This paper introduces a new\nproblem: how do we generate adversarial noise under real-time constraints to\nsupport such real-time adversarial attacks? Understanding this problem improves\nour understanding of the threat these attacks pose to real-time systems and\nprovides security evaluation benchmarks for future defenses. Therefore, we\nfirst conduct a run-time analysis of adversarial generation algorithms.\nUniversal attacks produce a general attack offline, with no online overhead,\nand can be applied to any input; however, their success rate is limited because\nof their generality. In contrast, online algorithms, which work on a specific\ninput, are computationally expensive, making them inappropriate for operation\nunder time constraints. Thus, we propose ROOM, a novel Real-time Online-Offline\nattack construction Model where an offline component serves to warm up the\nonline algorithm, making it possible to generate highly successful attacks\nunder time constraints.",

We use it\nto derive a maximum class of VC dimension 3 that has no corners. This refutes\nseveral previous works in machine learning from the past 11 years. In\nparticular, it implies that all previous constructions of optimal unlabeled\nsample compression schemes for maximum classes are erroneous.\n\nOn the positive side we present a new construction of an unlabeled sample\ncompression scheme for maximum classes. We leave as open whether our unlabeled\nsample compression scheme extends to ample (a.k.a. lopsided or extremal)\nclasses, which represent a natural and far-reaching generalization of maximum\nclasses. Towards resolving this question, we provide a geometric\ncharacterization in terms of unique sink orientations of the 1-skeletons of\nassociated cubical complexes.",

          "description": "Deep neural networks have proved hugely successful, achieving human-like\nperformance on a variety of tasks. However, they are also computationally\nexpensive, which has motivated the development of model compression techniques\nwhich reduce the resource consumption associated with deep learning models.\nNevertheless, recent studies have suggested that model compression can have an\nadverse effect on algorithmic fairness, amplifying existing biases in machine\nlearning models. With this project we aim to extend those studies to the\ncontext of facial expression recognition. To do that, we set up a neural\nnetwork classifier to perform facial expression recognition and implement\nseveral model compression techniques on top of it. We then run experiments on\ntwo facial expression datasets, namely the Extended Cohn-Kanade Dataset (CK+DB)\nand the Real-World Affective Faces Database (RAF-DB), to examine the individual\nand combined effect that compression techniques have on the model size,\naccuracy and fairness. Our experimental results show that: (i) Compression and\nquantisation achieve significant reduction in model size with minimal impact on\noverall accuracy for both CK+DB and RAF-DB; (ii) in terms of model accuracy,\nthe classifier trained and tested on RAF-DB seems more robust to compression\ncompared to the CK+ DB; (iii) for RAF-DB, the different compression strategies\ndo not seem to increase the gap in predictive performance across the sensitive\nattributes of gender, race and age which is in contrast with the results on the\nCK+DB, where compression seems to amplify existing biases for gender. We\nanalyse the results and discuss the potential reasons for our findings.",

          "description": "Neural networks are known to be vulnerable to adversarial attacks -- slight\nbut carefully constructed perturbations of the inputs which can drastically\nimpair the network's performance. Many defense methods have been proposed for\nimproving robustness of deep networks by training them on adversarially\nperturbed inputs. However, these models often remain vulnerable to new types of\nattacks not seen during training, and even to slightly stronger versions of\npreviously seen attacks.

However, fast and reliable\nlocalization of small-scale regions-of-interest (ROI) has remained a key\nchallenge, as discriminative morphologic features often occupy only a small\nfraction of a gigapixel-scale whole-slide image (WSI). In this paper, we\npropose a sparse WSI analysis method for the rapid identification of high-power\nROI for WSI-level classification. We develop an evaluation framework inspired\nby the early classification literature, in order to quantify the tradeoff\nbetween diagnostic performance and inference time for sparse analytic\napproaches. We test our method on a common but time-consuming task in pathology\n- that of diagnosing gastric intestinal metaplasia (GIM) on hematoxylin and\neosin (H&E)-stained slides from endoscopic biopsy specimens. GIM is a\nwell-known precursor lesion along the pathway to development of gastric cancer.\nWe performed a thorough evaluation of the performance and inference time of our\napproach on a test set of GIM-positive and GIM-negative WSI, finding that our\nmethod successfully detects GIM in all positive WSI, with a WSI-level\nclassification area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of\n0.98 and an average precision (AP) of 0.95. Furthermore, we show that our\nmethod can attain these metrics in under one minute on a standard CPU.

          "description": "High-quality estimates of uncertainty and robustness are crucial for numerous\nreal-world applications, especially for deep learning which underlies many\ndeployed ML systems. The ability to compare techniques for improving these\nestimates is therefore very important for research and practice alike. Yet,\ncompetitive comparisons of methods are often lacking due to a range of reasons,\nincluding: compute availability for extensive tuning, incorporation of\nsufficiently many baselines, and concrete documentation for reproducibility. In\nthis paper we introduce Uncertainty Baselines: high-quality implementations of\nstandard and state-of-the-art deep learning methods on a variety of tasks. As\nof this writing, the collection spans 19 methods across 9 tasks, each with at\nleast 5 metrics. Each baseline is a self-contained experiment pipeline with\neasily reusable and extendable components. Our goal is to provide immediate\nstarting points for experimentation with new methods or applications.\nAdditionally we provide model checkpoints, experiment outputs as Python\nnotebooks, and leaderboards for comparing results.

          "description": "Feature selection, as a vital dimension reduction technique, reduces data\ndimension by identifying an essential subset of input features, which can\nfacilitate interpretable insights into learning and inference processes.\nAlgorithmic stability is a key characteristic of an algorithm regarding its\nsensitivity to perturbations of input samples. In this paper, we propose an\ninnovative unsupervised feature selection algorithm attaining this stability\nwith provable guarantees. The architecture of our algorithm consists of a\nfeature scorer and a feature selector. The scorer trains a neural network (NN)\nto globally score all the features, and the selector adopts a dependent sub-NN\nto locally evaluate the representation abilities for selecting features.\nFurther, we present algorithmic stability analysis and show that our algorithm\nhas a performance guarantee via a generalization error bound. Extensive\nexperimental results on real-world datasets demonstrate superior generalization\nperformance of our proposed algorithm to strong baseline methods.

          "description": "This paper proposes a method for modeling human driver interactions that\nrelies on multi-output gaussian processes. The proposed method is developed as\na refinement of the game theoretical hierarchical reasoning approach called\n\"level-k reasoning\" which conventionally assigns discrete levels of behaviors\nto agents. Although it is shown to be an effective modeling tool, the level-k\nreasoning approach may pose undesired constraints for predicting human decision\nmaking due to a limited number (usually 2 or 3) of driver policies it extracts.\nThe proposed approach is put forward to fill this gap in the literature by\nintroducing a continuous domain framework that enables an infinite policy\nspace. By using the approach presented in this paper, more accurate driver\nmodels can be obtained, which can then be employed for creating high fidelity\nsimulation platforms for the validation of autonomous vehicle control\nalgorithms. The proposed method is validated on a real traffic dataset and\ncompared with the conventional level-k approach to demonstrate its\ncontributions and implications.",

          "description": "Audio-based automatic speech recognition (ASR) degrades significantly in\nnoisy environments and is particularly vulnerable to interfering speech, as the\nmodel cannot determine which speaker to transcribe. Audio-visual speech\nrecognition (AVSR) systems improve robustness by complementing the audio stream\nwith the visual information that is invariant to noise and helps the model\nfocus on the desired speaker. However, previous AVSR work focused solely on the\nsupervised learning setup; hence the progress was hindered by the amount of\nlabeled data available. In this work, we present a self-supervised AVSR\nframework built upon Audio-Visual HuBERT (AV-HuBERT), a state-of-the-art\naudio-visual speech representation learning model. On the largest available\nAVSR benchmark dataset LRS3, our approach outperforms prior state-of-the-art by\n~50% (28.0% vs. 14.1%) using less than 10% of labeled data (433hr vs. 30hr) in\nthe presence of babble noise, while reducing the WER of an audio-based model by\nover 75% (25.8% vs. 5.8%) on average.",

          "description": "State-of-the-art machine learning models are routinely trained on large-scale\ndistributed clusters. Crucially, such systems can be compromised when some of\nthe computing devices exhibit abnormal (Byzantine) behavior and return\narbitrary results to the parameter server (PS). This behavior may be attributed\nto a plethora of reasons, including system failures and orchestrated attacks.\nExisting work suggests robust aggregation and/or computational redundancy to\nalleviate the effect of distorted gradients. However, most of these schemes are\nineffective when an adversary knows the task assignment and can choose the\nattacked workers judiciously to induce maximal damage. Our proposed method\nAspis assigns gradient computations to worker nodes using a subset-based\nassignment which allows for multiple consistency checks on the behavior of a\nworker node. Examination of the calculated gradients and post-processing\n(clique-finding in an appropriately constructed graph) by the central node\nallows for efficient detection and subsequent exclusion of adversaries from the\ntraining process. We prove the Byzantine resilience and detection guarantees of\nAspis under weak and strong attacks and extensively evaluate the system on\nvarious large-scale training scenarios. The principal metric for our\nexperiments is the test accuracy, for which we demonstrate a significant\nimprovement of about 30% compared to many state-of-the-art approaches on the\nCIFAR-10 dataset. The corresponding reduction of the fraction of corrupted\ngradients ranges from 16% to 99%.",

          "description": "While advances in multi-agent learning have enabled the training of\nincreasingly complex agents, most existing techniques produce a final policy\nthat is not designed to adapt to a new partner's strategy. However, we would\nlike our AI agents to adjust their strategy based on the strategies of those\naround them. In this work, we study the problem of conditional multi-agent\nimitation learning, where we have access to joint trajectory demonstrations at\ntraining time, and we must interact with and adapt to new partners at test\ntime. This setting is challenging because we must infer a new partner's\nstrategy and adapt our policy to that strategy, all without knowledge of the\nenvironment reward or dynamics. We formalize this problem of conditional\nmulti-agent imitation learning, and propose a novel approach to address the\ndifficulties of scalability and data scarcity. Our key insight is that\nvariations across partners in multi-agent games are often highly structured,\nand can be represented via a low-rank subspace. Leveraging tools from tensor\ndecomposition, our model learns a low-rank subspace over ego and partner agent\nstrategies, then infers and adapts to a new partner strategy by interpolating\nin the subspace. We experiments with a mix of collaborative tasks, including\nbandits, particle, and Hanabi environments. Additionally, we test our\nconditional policies against real human partners in a user study on the\nOvercooked game. Our model adapts better to new partners compared to baselines,\nand robustly handles diverse settings ranging from discrete/continuous actions\nand static/online evaluation with AI/human partners.",

AI is heavily invested in both industry and academy. However, there is\nalso a lot of hype in the current AI debate. AI based on so-called deep\nlearning has achieved impressive results in many problems, but its limits are\nalready visible. AI has been under research since the 1940s, and the industry\nhas seen many ups and downs due to over-expectations and related\ndisappointments that have followed.\n\nThe purpose of this book is to give a realistic picture of AI, its history,\nits potential and limitations. We believe that AI is a helper, not a ruler of\nhumans. We begin by describing what AI is and how it has evolved over the\ndecades. After fundamentals, we explain the importance of massive data for the\ncurrent mainstream of artificial intelligence. The most common representations\nfor AI, methods, and machine learning are covered. In addition, the main\napplication areas are introduced. Computer vision has been central to the\ndevelopment of AI. The book provides a general introduction to computer vision,\nand includes an exposure to the results and applications of our own research.\nEmotions are central to human intelligence, but little use has been made in AI.\nWe present the basics of emotional intelligence and our own research on the\ntopic. We discuss super-intelligence that transcends human understanding,\nexplaining why such achievement seems impossible on the basis of present\nknowledge,and how AI could be improved. Finally, a summary is made of the\ncurrent state of AI and what to do in the future. In the appendix, we look at\nthe development of AI education, especially from the perspective of contents at\nour own university.",

          "description": "Learning to solve combinatorial optimization problems, such as the vehicle\nrouting problem, offers great computational advantages over classical\noperations research solvers and heuristics. The recently developed deep\nreinforcement learning approaches either improve an initially given solution\niteratively or sequentially construct a set of individual tours. However, most\nof the existing learning-based approaches are not able to work for a fixed\nnumber of vehicles and thus bypass the complex assignment problem of the\ncustomers onto an apriori given number of available vehicles. On the other\nhand, this makes them less suitable for real applications, as many logistic\nservice providers rely on solutions provided for a specific bounded fleet size\nand cannot accommodate short term changes to the number of vehicles. In\ncontrast we propose a powerful supervised deep learning framework that\nconstructs a complete tour plan from scratch while respecting an apriori fixed\nnumber of available vehicles. In combination with an efficient post-processing\nscheme, our supervised approach is not only much faster and easier to train but\nalso achieves competitive results that incorporate the practical aspect of\nvehicle costs.

          "description": "Generative adversarial networks (GANs) with clustered latent spaces can\nperform conditional generation in a completely unsupervised manner. In the real\nworld, the salient attributes of unlabeled data can be imbalanced. However,\nmost of existing unsupervised conditional GANs cannot cluster attributes of\nthese data in their latent spaces properly because they assume uniform\ndistributions of the attributes. To address this problem, we theoretically\nderive Stein latent optimization that provides reparameterizable gradient\nestimations of the latent distribution parameters assuming a Gaussian mixture\nprior in a continuous latent space. Structurally, we introduce an encoder\nnetwork and novel unsupervised conditional contrastive loss to ensure that data\ngenerated from a single mixture component represent a single attribute. We\nconfirm that the proposed method, named Stein Latent Optimization for GANs\n(SLOGAN), successfully learns balanced or imbalanced attributes and achieves\nstate-of-the-art unsupervised conditional generation performance even in the\nabsence of attribute information (e.g., the imbalance ratio). Moreover, we\ndemonstrate that the attributes to be learned can be manipulated using a small\namount of probe data.",

          "description": "Due to the success of deep learning (DL) and its growing job market, students\nand researchers from many areas are interested in learning about DL\ntechnologies. Visualization has proven to be of great help during this learning\nprocess. While most current educational visualizations are targeted towards one\nspecific architecture or use case, recurrent neural networks (RNNs), which are\ncapable of processing sequential data, are not covered yet. This is despite the\nfact that tasks on sequential data, such as text and function analysis, are at\nthe forefront of DL research. Therefore, we propose exploRNN, the first\ninteractively explorable educational visualization for RNNs. On the basis of\nmaking learning easier and more fun, we define educational objectives targeted\ntowards understanding RNNs. We use these objectives to form guidelines for the\nvisual design process. By means of exploRNN, which is accessible online, we\nprovide an overview of the training process of RNNs at a coarse level, while\nalso allowing a detailed inspection of the data flow within LSTM cells. In an\nempirical study, we assessed 37 subjects in a between-subjects design to\ninvestigate the learning outcomes and cognitive load of exploRNN compared to a\nclassic text-based learning environment. While learners in the text group are\nahead in superficial knowledge acquisition, exploRNN is particularly helpful\nfor deeper understanding of the learning content. In addition, the complex\ncontent in exploRNN is perceived as significantly easier and causes less\nextraneous load than in the text group. The study shows that for difficult\nlearning material such as recurrent networks, where deep understanding is\nimportant, interactive visualizations such as exploRNN can be helpful.",

          "description": "Knowledge Graph Embedding (KGE) aims to learn representations for entities\nand relations. Most KGE models have gained great success, especially on\nextrapolation scenarios. Specifically, given an unseen triple (h, r, t), a\ntrained model can still correctly predict t from (h, r, ?), or h from (?, r,\nt), such extrapolation ability is impressive. However, most existing KGE works\nfocus on the design of delicate triple modeling function, which mainly tells us\nhow to measure the plausibility of observed triples, but offers limited\nexplanation of why the methods can extrapolate to unseen data, and what are the\nimportant factors to help KGE extrapolate. Therefore in this work, we attempt\nto study the KGE extrapolation of two problems: 1. How does KGE extrapolate to\nunseen data? 2. How to design the KGE model with better extrapolation ability?\nFor the problem 1, we first discuss the impact factors for extrapolation and\nfrom relation, entity and triple level respectively, propose three Semantic\nEvidences (SEs), which can be observed from train set and provide important\nsemantic information for extrapolation. Then we verify the effectiveness of SEs\nthrough extensive experiments on several typical KGE methods. For the problem\n2, to make better use of the three levels of SE, we propose a novel GNN-based\nKGE model, called Semantic Evidence aware Graph Neural Network (SE-GNN). In\nSE-GNN, each level of SE is modeled explicitly by the corresponding neighbor\npattern, and merged sufficiently by the multi-layer aggregation, which\ncontributes to obtaining more extrapolative knowledge representation. Finally,\nthrough extensive experiments on FB15k-237 and WN18RR datasets, we show that\nSE-GNN achieves state-of-the-art performance on Knowledge Graph Completion task\nand performs a better extrapolation ability.",

          "description": "We have built a computational model for individual aging trajectories of\nhealth and survival, which contains physical, functional, and biological\nvariables, and is conditioned on demographic, lifestyle, and medical background\ninformation. We combine techniques of modern machine learning with an\ninterpretable interaction network, where health variables are coupled by\nexplicit pair-wise interactions within a stochastic dynamical system. Our\ndynamic joint interpretable network (DJIN) model is scalable to large\nlongitudinal data sets, is predictive of individual high-dimensional health\ntrajectories and survival from baseline health states, and infers an\ninterpretable network of directed interactions between the health variables.\nThe network identifies plausible physiological connections between health\nvariables as well as clusters of strongly connected health variables. We use\nEnglish Longitudinal Study of Aging (ELSA) data to train our model and show\nthat it performs better than multiple dedicated linear models for health\noutcomes and survival. We compare our model with flexible lower-dimensional\nlatent-space models to explore the dimensionality required to accurately model\naging health outcomes. Our DJIN model can be used to generate synthetic\nindividuals that age realistically, to impute missing data, and to simulate\nfuture aging outcomes given arbitrary initial health states.",

          "description": "Deep reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms are predominantly evaluated by\ncomparing their relative performance on a large suite of tasks. Most published\nresults on deep RL benchmarks compare point estimates of aggregate performance\nsuch as mean and median scores across tasks, ignoring the statistical\nuncertainty implied by the use of a finite number of training runs. Beginning\nwith the Arcade Learning Environment (ALE), the shift towards\ncomputationally-demanding benchmarks has led to the practice of evaluating only\na small number of runs per task, exacerbating the statistical uncertainty in\npoint estimates. In this paper, we argue that reliable evaluation in the few\nrun deep RL regime cannot ignore the uncertainty in results without running the\nrisk of slowing down progress in the field. We illustrate this point using a\ncase study on the Atari 100k benchmark, where we find substantial discrepancies\nbetween conclusions drawn from point estimates alone versus a more thorough\nstatistical analysis. With the aim of increasing the field's confidence in\nreported results with a handful of runs, we advocate for reporting interval\nestimates of aggregate performance and propose performance profiles to account\nfor the variability in results, as well as present more robust and efficient\naggregate metrics, such as interquartile mean scores, to achieve small\nuncertainty in results. Using such statistical tools, we scrutinize performance\nevaluations of existing algorithms on other widely used RL benchmarks including\nthe ALE, Procgen, and the DeepMind Control Suite, again revealing discrepancies\nin prior comparisons. Our findings call for a change in how we evaluate\nperformance in deep RL, for which we present a more rigorous evaluation\nmethodology, accompanied with an open-source library rliable, to prevent\nunreliable results from stagnating the field.",

          "description": "Deep neural networks (DNNs) are notorious for making more mistakes for the\nclasses that have substantially fewer samples than the others during training.\nSuch class imbalance is ubiquitous in clinical applications and very crucial to\nhandle because the classes with fewer samples most often correspond to critical\ncases (e.g., cancer) where misclassifications can have severe consequences. Not\nto miss such cases, binary classifiers need to be operated at high True\nPositive Rates (TPRs) by setting a higher threshold, but this comes at the cost\nof very high False Positive Rates (FPRs) for problems with class imbalance.\nExisting methods for learning under class imbalance most often do not take this\ninto account. We argue that prediction accuracy should be improved by\nemphasizing reducing FPRs at high TPRs for problems where misclassification of\nthe positive, i.e. critical, class samples are associated with higher cost. To\nthis end, we pose the training of a DNN for binary classification as a\nconstrained optimization problem and introduce a novel constraint that can be\nused with existing loss functions to enforce maximal area under the ROC curve\n(AUC) through prioritizing FPR reduction at high TPR. We solve the resulting\nconstrained optimization problem using an Augmented Lagrangian method (ALM).\nGoing beyond binary, we also propose two possible extensions of the proposed\nconstraint for multi-class classification problems. We present experimental\nresults for image-based binary and multi-class classification applications\nusing an in-house medical imaging dataset, CIFAR10, and CIFAR100. Our results\ndemonstrate that the proposed method improves the baselines in majority of the\ncases by attaining higher accuracy on critical classes while reducing the\nmisclassification rate for the non-critical class samples.",

          "description": "Software often produces biased outputs. In particular, machine learning (ML)\nbased software are known to produce erroneous predictions when processing\ndiscriminatory inputs. Such unfair program behavior can be caused by societal\nbias. In the last few years, Amazon, Microsoft and Google have provided\nsoftware services that produce unfair outputs, mostly due to societal bias\n(e.g. gender or race). In such events, developers are saddled with the task of\nconducting fairness testing. Fairness testing is challenging; developers are\ntasked with generating discriminatory inputs that reveal and explain biases.\n\nWe propose a grammar-based fairness testing approach (called ASTRAEA) which\nleverages context-free grammars to generate discriminatory inputs that reveal\nfairness violations in software systems. Using probabilistic grammars, ASTRAEA\nalso provides fault diagnosis by isolating the cause of observed software bias.\nASTRAEA's diagnoses facilitate the improvement of ML fairness.\n\nASTRAEA was evaluated on 18 software systems that provide three major natural\nlanguage processing (NLP) services. In our evaluation, ASTRAEA generated\nfairness violations with a rate of ~18%. ASTRAEA generated over 573K\ndiscriminatory test cases and found over 102K fairness violations.

          "description": "The exemplar-free class incremental learning requires classification models\nto learn new class knowledge incrementally without retaining any old samples.\nRecently, the framework based on parallel one-class classifiers (POC), which\ntrains a one-class classifier (OCC) independently for each category, has\nattracted extensive attention, since it can naturally avoid catastrophic\nforgetting. POC, however, suffers from weak discriminability and comparability\ndue to its independent training strategy for different OOCs. To meet this\nchallenge, we propose a new framework, named Discriminative and Comparable\nOne-class classifiers for Incremental Learning (DisCOIL). DisCOIL follows the\nbasic principle of POC, but it adopts variational auto-encoders (VAE) instead\nof other well-established one-class classifiers (e.g. deep SVDD), because a\ntrained VAE can not only identify the probability of an input sample belonging\nto a class but also generate pseudo samples of the class to assist in learning\nnew tasks. With this advantage, DisCOIL trains a new-class VAE in contrast with\nthe old-class VAEs, which forces the new-class VAE to reconstruct better for\nnew-class samples but worse for the old-class pseudo samples, thus enhancing\nthe comparability. Furthermore, DisCOIL introduces a hinge reconstruction loss\nto ensure the discriminability. We evaluate our method extensively on MNIST,\nCIFAR10, and Tiny-ImageNet. The experimental results show that DisCOIL achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance.",

The second is an application\ndeveloped for one cloud, such as AWS or Azure, is difficult to reproduce in\nanother cloud, a.k.a. vendor lock-in problem. To tackle these problems, we\nleverage serverless computing and containerization techniques for automatic\nscalable big data application execution and reproducibility, and utilize the\nadapter design pattern to enable application portability and reproducibility\nacross different clouds. Based on the approach, we propose and develop an\nopen-source toolkit that supports 1) on-demand distributed hardware and\nsoftware environment provisioning, 2) automatic data and configuration storage\nfor each execution, 3) flexible client modes based on user preferences, 4)\nexecution history query, and 5) simple reproducibility of existing executions\nin the same environment or a different environment. We did extensive\nexperiments on both AWS and Azure using three big data analytics applications\nthat run on a virtual CPU/GPU cluster. Three main behaviors of our toolkit were\nbenchmarked: i) execution overhead ratio for reproducibility support, ii)\ndifferences of reproducing the same application on AWS and Azure in terms of\nexecution time, budgetary cost and cost-performance ratio, iii) differences\nbetween scale-out and scale-up approach for the same application on AWS and\nAzure.",

Prior work has approached TSC from two major directions: (1)\nsimilarity-based methods that classify time-series based on the nearest\nneighbors, and (2) deep learning models that directly learn the representations\nfor classification in a data-driven manner. Motivated by the different working\nmechanisms within these two research lines, we aim to connect them in such a\nway as to jointly model time-series similarities and learn the representations.\nThis is a challenging task because it is unclear how we should efficiently\nleverage similarity information. To tackle the challenge, we propose\nSimilarity-Aware Time-Series Classification (SimTSC), a conceptually simple and\ngeneral framework that models similarity information with graph neural networks\n(GNNs). Specifically, we formulate TSC as a node classification problem in\ngraphs, where the nodes correspond to time-series, and the links correspond to\npair-wise similarities. We further design a graph construction strategy and a\nbatch training algorithm with negative sampling to improve training efficiency.\nWe instantiate SimTSC with ResNet as the backbone and Dynamic Time Warping\n(DTW) as the similarity measure. Extensive experiments on the full UCR datasets\nand several multivariate datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of\nincorporating similarity information into deep learning models in both\nsupervised and semi-supervised settings.

          "description": "This paper presents local minimax regret lower bounds for adaptively\ncontrolling linear-quadratic-Gaussian (LQG) systems. We consider smoothly\nparametrized instances and provide an understanding of when logarithmic regret\nis impossible which is both instance specific and flexible enough to take\nproblem structure into account. This understanding relies on two key notions:\nThat of local-uninformativeness; when the optimal policy does not provide\nsufficient excitation for identification of the optimal policy, and yields a\ndegenerate Fisher information matrix; and that of\ninformation-regret-boundedness, when the small eigenvalues of a\npolicy-dependent information matrix are boundable in terms of the regret of\nthat policy. Combined with a reduction to Bayesian estimation and application\nof Van Trees' inequality, these two conditions are sufficient for proving\nregret bounds on order of magnitude $\\sqrt{T}$ in the time horizon, $T$. This\nmethod yields lower bounds that exhibit tight dimensional dependencies and\nscale naturally with control-theoretic problem constants. For instance, we are\nable to prove that systems operating near marginal stability are fundamentally\nhard to learn to control. We further show that large classes of systems satisfy\nthese conditions, among them any state-feedback system with both $A$- and\n$B$-matrices unknown. Most importantly, we also establish that a nontrivial\nclass of partially observable systems, essentially those that are\nover-actuated, satisfy these conditions, thus providing a $\\sqrt{T}$ lower\nbound also valid for partially observable systems. Finally, we turn to two\nsimple examples which demonstrate that our lower bound captures classical\ncontrol-theoretic intuition: our lower bounds diverge for systems operating\nnear marginal stability or with large filter gain -- these can be arbitrarily\nhard to (learn to) control.",

          "description": "In bandits with distribution shifts, one aims to automatically detect an\nunknown number $L$ of changes in reward distribution, and restart exploration\nwhen necessary. While this problem remained open for many years, a recent\nbreakthrough of Auer et al. (2018, 2019) provide the first adaptive procedure\nto guarantee an optimal (dynamic) regret $\\sqrt{LT}$, for $T$ rounds, with no\nknowledge of $L$. However, not all distributional shifts are equally severe,\ne.g., suppose no best arm switches occur, then we cannot rule out that a regret\n$O(\\sqrt{T})$ may remain possible; in other words, is it possible to achieve\ndynamic regret that optimally scales only with an unknown number of severe\nshifts? This unfortunately has remained elusive, despite various attempts (Auer\net al., 2019, Foster et al., 2020).\n\nWe resolve this problem in the case of two-armed bandits: we derive an\nadaptive procedure that guarantees a dynamic regret of order\n$\\tilde{O}(\\sqrt{\\tilde{L} T})$, where $\\tilde L \\ll L$ captures an unknown\nnumber of severe best arm changes, i.e., with significant switches in rewards,\nand which last sufficiently long to actually require a restart. As a\nconsequence, for any number $L$ of distributional shifts outside of these\nsevere shifts, our procedure achieves regret just $\\tilde{O}(\\sqrt{T})\\ll\n\\tilde{O}(\\sqrt{LT})$.\n\nFinally, we note that our notion of severe shift applies in both classical\nsettings of stochastic switching bandits and of adversarial bandits.",

          "description": "Self-supervision is recently surging at its new frontier of graph learning.\nIt facilitates graph representations beneficial to downstream tasks; but its\nsuccess could hinge on domain knowledge for handcraft or the often expensive\ntrials and errors. Even its state-of-the-art representative, graph contrastive\nlearning (GraphCL), is not completely free of those needs as GraphCL uses a\nprefabricated prior reflected by the ad-hoc manual selection of graph data\naugmentations. Our work aims at advancing GraphCL by answering the following\nquestions: How to represent the space of graph augmented views? What principle\ncan be relied upon to learn a prior in that space? And what framework can be\nconstructed to learn the prior in tandem with contrastive learning?\nAccordingly, we have extended the prefabricated discrete prior in the\naugmentation set, to a learnable continuous prior in the parameter space of\ngraph generators, assuming that graph priors per se, similar to the concept of\nimage manifolds, can be learned by data generation. Furthermore, to form\ncontrastive views without collapsing to trivial solutions due to the prior\nlearnability, we have leveraged both principles of information minimization\n(InfoMin) and information bottleneck (InfoBN) to regularize the learned priors.\nEventually, contrastive learning, InfoMin, and InfoBN are incorporated\norganically into one framework of bi-level optimization. Our principled and\nautomated approach has proven to be competitive against the state-of-the-art\ngraph self-supervision methods, including GraphCL, on benchmarks of small\ngraphs; and shown even better generalizability on large-scale graphs, without\nresorting to human expertise or downstream validation.

          "description": "Complex systems (stars, supernovae, galaxies, and clusters) often exhibit low\nscatter relations between observable properties (e.g., luminosity, velocity\ndispersion, oscillation period, temperature). These scaling relations can\nilluminate the underlying physics and can provide observational tools for\nestimating masses and distances. Machine learning can provide a systematic way\nto search for new scaling relations (or for simple extensions to existing\nrelations) in abstract high-dimensional parameter spaces. We use a machine\nlearning tool called symbolic regression (SR), which models the patterns in a\ngiven dataset in the form of analytic equations. We focus on the\nSunyaev-Zeldovich flux$-$cluster mass relation ($Y_\\mathrm{SZ}-M$), the scatter\nin which affects inference of cosmological parameters from cluster abundance\ndata. Using SR on the data from the IllustrisTNG hydrodynamical simulation, we\nfind a new proxy for cluster mass which combines $Y_\\mathrm{SZ}$ and\nconcentration of ionized gas ($c_\\mathrm{gas}$): $M \\propto\nY_\\mathrm{conc}^{3/5} \\equiv Y_\\mathrm{SZ}^{3/5} (1-A\\, c_\\mathrm{gas})$.\n$Y_\\mathrm{conc}$ reduces the scatter in the predicted $M$ by $\\sim 20-30$% for\nlarge clusters ($M\\gtrsim 10^{14}\\, h^{-1} \\, M_\\odot$) at both high and low\nredshifts, as compared to using just $Y_\\mathrm{SZ}$.

          "description": "Stochastic majorization-minimization (SMM) is an online extension of the\nclassical principle of majorization-minimization, which consists of sampling\ni.i.d. data points from a fixed data distribution and minimizing a recursively\ndefined majorizing surrogate of an objective function. In this paper, we\nintroduce stochastic block majorization-minimization, where the surrogates can\nnow be only block multi-convex and a single block is optimized at a time within\na diminishing radius. Relaxing the standard strong convexity requirements for\nsurrogates in SMM, our framework gives wider applicability including online\nCANDECOMP/PARAFAC (CP) dictionary learning and yields greater computational\nefficiency especially when the problem dimension is large. We provide an\nextensive convergence analysis on the proposed algorithm, which we derive under\npossibly dependent data streams, relaxing the standard i.i.d. assumption on\ndata samples. We show that the proposed algorithm converges almost surely to\nthe set of stationary points of a nonconvex objective under constraints at a\nrate $O((\\log n)^{1+\\eps}/n^{1/2})$ for the empirical loss function and\n$O((\\log n)^{1+\\eps}/n^{1/4})$ for the expected loss function, where $n$\ndenotes the number of data samples processed. Under some additional assumption,\nthe latter convergence rate can be improved to $O((\\log n)^{1+\\eps}/n^{1/2})$.\nOur results provide first convergence rate bounds for various online matrix and\ntensor decomposition algorithms under a general Markovian data setting.",

          "description": "Self-attention shows outstanding competence in capturing long-range\nrelationships while enhancing performance on vision tasks, such as image\nclassification and image captioning. However, the self-attention module highly\nrelies on the dot product multiplication and dimension alignment among\nquery-key-value features, which cause two problems: (1) The dot product\nmultiplication results in exhaustive and redundant computation. (2) Due to the\nvisual feature map often appearing as a multi-dimensional tensor, reshaping the\nscale of the tensor feature to adapt to the dimension alignment might destroy\nthe internal structure of the tensor feature map. To address these problems,\nthis paper proposes a self-attention plug-in module with its variants, namely,\nSynthesizing Tensor Transformations (STT), for directly processing image tensor\nfeatures. Without computing the dot-product multiplication among\nquery-key-value, the basic STT is composed of the tensor transformation to\nlearn the synthetic attention weight from visual information. The effectiveness\nof STT series is validated on the image classification and image caption.\nExperiments show that the proposed STT achieves competitive performance while\nkeeping robustness compared to self-attention based above vision tasks.",

          "description": "Recent years have witnessed growing interests in online incremental learning.\nHowever, there are three major challenges in this area. The first major\ndifficulty is concept drift, that is, the probability distribution in the\nstreaming data would change as the data arrives. The second major difficulty is\ncatastrophic forgetting, that is, forgetting what we have learned before when\nlearning new knowledge. The last one we often ignore is the learning of the\nlatent representation. Only good latent representation can improve the\nprediction accuracy of the model. Our research builds on this observation and\nattempts to overcome these difficulties. To this end, we propose an Adaptive\nOnline Incremental Learning for evolving data streams (AOIL). We use\nauto-encoder with the memory module, on the one hand, we obtained the latent\nfeatures of the input, on the other hand, according to the reconstruction loss\nof the auto-encoder with memory module, we could successfully detect the\nexistence of concept drift and trigger the update mechanism, adjust the model\nparameters in time. In addition, we divide features, which are derived from the\nactivation of the hidden layers, into two parts, which are used to extract the\ncommon and private features respectively. By means of this approach, the model\ncould learn the private features of the new coming instances, but do not forget\nwhat we have learned in the past (shared features), which reduces the\noccurrence of catastrophic forgetting. At the same time, to get the fusion\nfeature vector we use the self-attention mechanism to effectively fuse the\nextracted features, which further improved the latent representation learning.",

          "description": "Federated Learning (FL) trains a machine learning model on distributed\nclients without exposing individual data. Unlike centralized training that is\nusually based on carefully-organized data, FL deals with on-device data that\nare often unfiltered and imbalanced. As a result, conventional FL training\nprotocol that treats all data equally leads to a waste of local computational\nresources and slows down the global learning process. To this end, we propose\nFedBalancer, a systematic FL framework that actively selects clients' training\nsamples. Our sample selection strategy prioritizes more \"informative\" data\nwhile respecting privacy and computational capabilities of clients. To better\nutilize the sample selection to speed up global training, we further introduce\nan adaptive deadline control scheme that predicts the optimal deadline for each\nround with varying client train data. Compared with existing FL algorithms with\ndeadline configuration methods, our evaluation on five datasets from three\ndifferent domains shows that FedBalancer improves the time-to-accuracy\nperformance by 1.22~4.62x while improving the model accuracy by 1.0~3.3%. We\nalso show that FedBalancer is readily applicable to other FL approaches by\ndemonstrating that FedBalancer improves the convergence speed and accuracy when\noperating jointly with three different FL algorithms.",

In popular settings, the true dynamical models are unknown to the\ndecision-maker and need to be interactively learned by applying control inputs\nto the systems. Unlike the matured literature of efficient reinforcement\nlearning policies for adaptive control of a single system, results on joint\nlearning of multiple systems are not currently available. Especially, the\nimportant problem of fast and reliable joint-stabilization remains unaddressed\nand so is the focus of this work. We propose a novel joint learning-based\nstabilization algorithm for quickly learning stabilizing policies for all\nsystems understudy, from the data of unstable state trajectories.

          "description": "This paper investigates the dynamics of competition among organizations with\nunequal expertise. Multi-agent reinforcement learning has been used to simulate\nand understand the impact of various incentive schemes designed to offset such\ninequality. We design Touch-Mark, a game based on well-known\nmulti-agent-particle-environment, where two teams (weak, strong) with unequal\nbut changing skill levels compete against each other. For training such a game,\nwe propose a novel controller assisted multi-agent reinforcement learning\nalgorithm \\our\\, which empowers each agent with an ensemble of policies along\nwith a supervised controller that by selectively partitioning the sample space,\ntriggers intelligent role division among the teammates. Using C-MADDPG as an\nunderlying framework, we propose an incentive scheme for the weak team such\nthat the final rewards of both teams become the same. We find that in spite of\nthe incentive, the final reward of the weak team falls short of the strong\nteam. On inspecting, we realize that an overall incentive scheme for the weak\nteam does not incentivize the weaker agents within that team to learn and\nimprove. To offset this, we now specially incentivize the weaker player to\nlearn and as a result, observe that the weak team beyond an initial phase\nperforms at par with the stronger team. The final goal of the paper has been to\nformulate a dynamic incentive scheme that continuously balances the reward of\nthe two teams. This is achieved by devising an incentive scheme enriched with\nan RL agent which takes minimum information from the environment.",

          "description": "Traditional text classification approaches often require a good amount of\nlabeled data, which is difficult to obtain, especially in restricted domains or\nless widespread languages. This lack of labeled data has led to the rise of\nlow-resource methods, that assume low data availability in natural language\nprocessing. Among them, zero-shot learning stands out, which consists of\nlearning a classifier without any previously labeled data. The best results\nreported with this approach use language models such as Transformers, but fall\ninto two problems: high execution time and inability to handle long texts as\ninput. This paper proposes a new model, ZeroBERTo, which leverages an\nunsupervised clustering step to obtain a compressed data representation before\nthe classification task. We show that ZeroBERTo has better performance for long\ninputs and shorter execution time, outperforming XLM-R by about 12% in the F1\nscore in the FolhaUOL dataset.

          "description": "Graph neural networks can be effectively applied to find solutions for many\nreal-world problems across widely diverse fields. The success of graph neural\nnetworks is linked to the message-passing mechanism on the graph, however, the\nmessage-aggregating behavior is still not entirely clear in most algorithms. To\nimprove functionality, we propose a new transparent network called Graph\nDecipher to investigate the message-passing mechanism by prioritizing in two\nmain components: the graph structure and node attributes, at the graph,\nfeature, and global levels on a graph under the node classification task.\nHowever, the computation burden now becomes the most significant issue because\nthe relevance of both graph structure and node attributes are computed on a\ngraph. In order to solve this issue, only relevant representative node\nattributes are extracted by graph feature filters, allowing calculations to be\nperformed in a category-oriented manner. Experiments on seven datasets show\nthat Graph Decipher achieves state-of-the-art performance while imposing a\nsubstantially lower computation burden under the node classification task.\nAdditionally, since our algorithm has the ability to explore the representative\nnode attributes by category, it is utilized to alleviate the imbalanced node\nclassification problem on multi-class graph datasets.",

          "description": "Federated learning (FL) is a widely adopted distributed learning paradigm in\npractice, which intends to preserve users' data privacy while leveraging the\nentire dataset of all participants for training. In FL, multiple models are\ntrained independently on the users and aggregated centrally to update a global\nmodel in an iterative process. Although this approach is excellent at\npreserving privacy by design, FL still tends to suffer from quality issues such\nas attacks or byzantine faults. Some recent attempts have been made to address\nsuch quality challenges on the robust aggregation techniques for FL. However,\nthe effectiveness of state-of-the-art (SOTA) robust FL techniques is still\nunclear and lacks a comprehensive study. Therefore, to better understand the\ncurrent quality status and challenges of these SOTA FL techniques in the\npresence of attacks and faults, in this paper, we perform a large-scale\nempirical study to investigate the SOTA FL's quality from multiple angles of\nattacks, simulated faults (via mutation operators), and aggregation (defense)\nmethods. In particular, we perform our study on two generic image datasets and\none real-world federated medical image dataset. We also systematically\ninvestigate the effect of the distribution of attacks/faults over users and the\nindependent and identically distributed (IID) factors, per dataset, on the\nrobustness results. After a large-scale analysis with 496 configurations, we\nfind that most mutators on each individual user have a negligible effect on the\nfinal model. Moreover, choosing the most robust FL aggregator depends on the\nattacks and datasets. Finally, we illustrate that it is possible to achieve a\ngeneric solution that works almost as well or even better than any single\naggregator on all attacks and configurations with a simple ensemble model of\naggregators.",

          "description": "This paper introduces a new neural network-based estimation approach that is\ninspired by the biological phenomenon whereby humans and animals vary the\nlevels of attention and effort that they dedicate to a problem depending upon\nits difficulty. The proposed approach leverages alternate models' internal\nlevels of confidence in their own projections. If the least costly model is\nconfident in its classification, then that is the classification used; if not,\nthe model with the next lowest cost of implementation is run, and so on. This\nuse of successively more complex models -- together with the models' internal\npropensity scores to evaluate their likelihood of being correct -- makes it\npossible to substantially reduce resource use while maintaining high standards\nfor classification accuracy. The approach is applied to the digit recognition\nproblem from Google's Street View House Numbers dataset, using Multilayer\nPerceptron (MLP) neural networks trained on high- and low-resolution versions\nof the digit images. The algorithm examines the low-resolution images first,\nonly moving to higher resolution images if the classification from the initial\nlow-resolution pass does not have a high degree of confidence.

However, many real-world\nproblems, such as social networks, financial transactions, recommendation\nsystems, etc., are dynamic, that is, nodes and edges are added or deleted over\ntime. Therefore, in recent years, dynamic graph neural networks have received\nmore and more attention from researchers. In this work, we propose a novel\ndynamic graph neural network, Efficient-Dyn. It adaptively encodes temporal\ninformation into a sequence of patches with an equal amount of\ntemporal-topological structure. Therefore, while avoiding the use of snapshots\nto cause information loss, it also achieves a finer time granularity, which is\nclose to what continuous networks could provide. In addition, we also designed\na lightweight module, Sparse Temporal Transformer, to compute node\nrepresentations through both structural neighborhoods and temporal dynamics.\nSince the fully-connected attention conjunction is simplified, the computation\ncost is far lower than the current state-of-the-arts.

For a class of equations in which the solution contains a\nwide range of scales, the network training process can suffer from slow\nconvergence and low accuracy due to its inability to capture the high-frequency\ncomponents. In this work, we propose a hierarchical approach to improve the\nconvergence rate and accuracy of the neural network solution to partial\ndifferential equations. The proposed method comprises multi-training levels in\nwhich a newly introduced neural network is guided to learn the residual of the\nprevious level approximation.

In this paper we investigate\nhow RL agents are affected by exchanging the small MLPs with larger modern\nnetworks with skip connections and normalization, focusing specifically on\nactor-critic algorithms. We empirically verify that naively adopting such\narchitectures leads to instabilities and poor performance, likely contributing\nto the popularity of simple models in practice. However, we show that dataset\nsize is not the limiting factor, and instead argue that instability from taking\ngradients through the critic is the culprit. We demonstrate that spectral\nnormalization (SN) can mitigate this issue and enable stable training with\nlarge modern architectures. After smoothing with SN, larger models yield\nsignificant performance improvements -- suggesting that more \"easy\" gains may\nbe had by focusing on model architectures in addition to algorithmic\ninnovations.",

          "description": "Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) is one promising approach to teaching\nrobots to perform complex tasks. Because methods that directly reuse the stored\nexperience data cannot follow the change of the environment in robotic problems\nwith a time-varying environment, online DRL is required. The eligibility traces\nmethod is well known as an online learning technique for improving sample\nefficiency in traditional reinforcement learning with linear regressors rather\nthan DRL. The dependency between parameters of deep neural networks would\ndestroy the eligibility traces, which is why they are not integrated with DRL.\nAlthough replacing the gradient with the most influential one rather than\naccumulating the gradients as the eligibility traces can alleviate this\nproblem, the replacing operation reduces the number of reuses of previous\nexperiences. To address these issues, this study proposes a new eligibility\ntraces method that can be used even in DRL while maintaining high sample\nefficiency. When the accumulated gradients differ from those computed using the\nlatest parameters, the proposed method takes into account the divergence\nbetween the past and latest parameters to adaptively decay the eligibility\ntraces. Bregman divergences between outputs computed by the past and latest\nparameters are exploited due to the infeasible computational cost of the\ndivergence between the past and latest parameters. In addition, a generalized\nmethod with multiple time-scale traces is designed for the first time. This\ndesign allows for the replacement of the most influential adaptively\naccumulated (decayed) eligibility traces.",

          "description": "In this paper, we address the problem of automatic repair of software\nvulnerabilities with deep learning. The major problem with data-driven\nvulnerability repair is that the few existing datasets of known confirmed\nvulnerabilities consist of only a few thousand examples. However, training a\ndeep learning model often requires hundreds of thousands of examples. In this\nwork, we leverage the intuition that the bug fixing task and the vulnerability\nfixing task are related and that the knowledge learned from bug fixes can be\ntransferred to fixing vulnerabilities. In the machine learning community, this\ntechnique is called transfer learning. In this paper, we propose an approach\nfor repairing security vulnerabilities named VRepair which is based on transfer\nlearning. VRepair is first trained on a large bug fix corpus and is then tuned\non a vulnerability fix dataset, which is an order of magnitude smaller. In our\nexperiments, we show that a model trained only on a bug fix corpus can already\nfix some vulnerabilities. Then, we demonstrate that transfer learning improves\nthe ability to repair vulnerable C functions. We also show that the transfer\nlearning model performs better than a model trained with a denoising task and\nfine-tuned on the vulnerability fixing task. To sum up, this paper shows that\ntransfer learning works well for repairing security vulnerabilities in C\ncompared to learning on a small dataset.",

          "description": "Although Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have shown incredible performance in\nperceptive and control tasks, several trustworthy issues are still open. One of\nthe most discussed topics is the existence of adversarial perturbations, which\nhas opened an interesting research line on provable techniques capable of\nquantifying the robustness of a given input. In this regard, the Euclidean\ndistance of the input from the classification boundary denotes a well-proved\nrobustness assessment as the minimal affordable adversarial perturbation.\nUnfortunately, computing such a distance is highly complex due the non-convex\nnature of NNs. Despite several methods have been proposed to address this\nissue, to the best of our knowledge, no provable results have been presented to\nestimate and bound the error committed. This paper addresses this issue by\nproposing two lightweight strategies to find the minimal adversarial\nperturbation. Differently from the state-of-the-art, the proposed approach\nallows formulating an error estimation theory of the approximate distance with\nrespect to the theoretical one. Finally, a substantial set of experiments is\nreported to evaluate the performance of the algorithms and support the\ntheoretical findings. The obtained results show that the proposed strategies\napproximate the theoretical distance for samples close to the classification\nboundary, leading to provable robustness guarantees against any adversarial\nattacks.",

We analysed crowdsourced respiratory\naudio data from 212 individuals over 5 days to 385 days, alongside their\nself-reported COVID-19 test results. We first explore the benefits of capturing\nlongitudinal dynamics of audio biomarkers for COVID-19 detection. The strong\nperformance, yielding an AUC-ROC of 0.79, sensitivity of 0.75 and specificity\nof 0.70, supports the effectiveness of the approach compared to methods that do\nnot leverage longitudinal dynamics. We further examine the predicted disease\nprogression trajectory, which displays high consistency with the longitudinal\ntest results with a correlation of 0.76 in the test cohort, and 0.86 in a\nsubset of the test cohort with 12 participants who report disease recovery.\n\nOur findings suggest that monitoring COVID-19 progression via longitudinal\naudio data has enormous potential in the tracking of individuals' disease\nprogression and recovery.",

While work has been done to reinforce existing decision\nboundaries, very little has been done to cover these scenarios where decision\nboundaries of the ML models should change in order to reflect new rules. In\nthis paper, we focus on user-provided feedback rules as a way to expedite the\nML models update process, and we formally introduce the problem of\npre-processing training data to edit an ML model in response to feedback rules\nsuch that once the model is retrained on the pre-processed data, its decision\nboundaries align more closely with the rules. To solve this problem, we propose\na novel data augmentation method, the Feedback Rule-Based Oversampling\nTechnique. Extensive experiments using different ML models and real world\ndatasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the method, in particular the benefit\nof augmentation and the ability to handle many feedback rules.",

The spatio-temporal causality demonstrates how the\ngradient-descent algorithm and various training data sampling techniques can\ninfluence and reshape the layout of learnt input representation and the\nclassification boundaries in consecutive epochs. Such causality allows us to\nobserve and analyze the whole learning process in the visible low dimensional\nspace. Technically, we propose four spatial and temporal properties and design\nour visualization solution to satisfy them. These properties preserve the most\nimportant information when inverse-)projecting input samples between the\nvisible low-dimensional and the invisible high-dimensional space, for causal\nanalyses. Our extensive experiments show that, comparing to baseline\napproaches, we achieve the best visualization performance regarding the\nspatial/temporal properties and visualization efficiency.

          "description": "A variety of modern applications exhibit multi-view multi-label learning,\nwhere each sample has multi-view features, and multiple labels are correlated\nvia common views. In recent years, several methods have been proposed to cope\nwith it and achieve much success, but still suffer from two key problems: 1)\nlack the ability to deal with the incomplete multi-view weak-label data, in\nwhich only a subset of features and labels are provided for each sample; 2)\nignore the presence of noisy views and tail labels usually occurring in\nreal-world problems. In this paper, we propose a novel method, named CEMENT, to\novercome the limitations. For 1), CEMENT jointly embeds incomplete views and\nweak labels into distinct low-dimensional subspaces, and then correlates them\nvia Hilbert-Schmidt Independence Criterion (HSIC). For 2), CEMEMT adaptively\nlearns the weights of embeddings to capture noisy views, and explores an\nadditional sparse component to model tail labels, making the low-rankness\navailable in the multi-label setting. We develop an alternating algorithm to\nsolve the proposed optimization problem. Experimental results on seven\nreal-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.",

          "description": "Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder which results\nin altered behavior, social development, and communication patterns. In past\nyears, autism prevalence has tripled, with 1 in 54 children now affected. Given\nthat traditional diagnosis is a lengthy, labor-intensive process, significant\nattention has been given to developing systems that automatically screen for\nautism. Prosody abnormalities are among the clearest signs of autism, with\naffected children displaying speech idiosyncrasies including echolalia,\nmonotonous intonation, atypical pitch, and irregular linguistic stress\npatterns. In this work, we present a suite of machine learning approaches to\ndetect autism in self-recorded speech audio captured from autistic and\nneurotypical (NT) children in home environments. We consider three methods to\ndetect autism in child speech: first, Random Forests trained on extracted audio\nfeatures (including Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients); second, convolutional\nneural networks (CNNs) trained on spectrograms; and third, fine-tuned wav2vec\n2.0--a state-of-the-art Transformer-based ASR model. We train our classifiers\non our novel dataset of cellphone-recorded child speech audio curated from\nStanford's Guess What? mobile game, an app designed to crowdsource videos of\nautistic and neurotypical children in a natural home environment. The Random\nForest classifier achieves 70% accuracy, the fine-tuned wav2vec 2.0 model\nachieves 77% accuracy, and the CNN achieves 79% accuracy when classifying\nchildren's audio as either ASD or NT. Our models were able to predict autism\nstatus when training on a varied selection of home audio clips with\ninconsistent recording quality, which may be more generalizable to real world\nconditions. These results demonstrate that machine learning methods offer\npromise in detecting autism automatically from speech without specialized\nequipment.",

However, in the practical scenario, labeled data can\nbe typically collected from multiple diverse sources, and they might be\ndifferent not only from the target domain but also from each other. Thus,\ndomain adapters from multiple sources should not be modeled in the same way.\nRecent deep learning based Multi-source Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (MUDA)\nalgorithms focus on extracting common domain-invariant representations for all\ndomains by aligning distribution of all pairs of source and target domains in a\ncommon feature space. However, it is often very hard to extract the same\ndomain-invariant representations for all domains in MUDA. In addition, these\nmethods match distributions without considering domain-specific decision\nboundaries between classes. To solve these problems, we propose a new framework\nwith two alignment stages for MUDA which not only respectively aligns the\ndistributions of each pair of source and target domains in multiple specific\nfeature spaces, but also aligns the outputs of classifiers by utilizing the\ndomain-specific decision boundaries. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our\nmethod can achieve remarkable results on popular benchmark datasets for image\nclassification.",

Analog In-Memory Computing (IMC)\nusing non-volatile memory (NVM) promises major efficiency improvements in deep\nneural network (DNN) inference and serves as on-chip memory storage for DNN\nweights. However, IMC's functional flexibility limitations and their impact on\nperformance, energy, and area efficiency are not yet fully understood at the\nsystem level. To target practical end-to-end IoT applications, IMC arrays must\nbe enclosed in heterogeneous programmable systems, introducing new system-level\nchallenges which we aim at addressing in this work. We present a heterogeneous\ntightly-coupled clustered architecture integrating 8 RISC-V cores, an in-memory\ncomputing accelerator (IMA), and digital accelerators. We benchmark the system\non a highly heterogeneous workload such as the Bottleneck layer from a\nMobileNetV2, showing 11.5x performance and 9.5x energy efficiency improvements,\ncompared to highly optimized parallel execution on the cores. Furthermore, we\nexplore the requirements for end-to-end inference of a full mobile-grade DNN\n(MobileNetV2) in terms of IMC array resources, by scaling up our heterogeneous\narchitecture to a multi-array accelerator. Our results show that our solution,\non the end-to-end inference of the MobileNetV2, is one order of magnitude\nbetter in terms of execution latency than existing programmable architectures\nand two orders of magnitude better than state-of-the-art heterogeneous\nsolutions integrating in-memory computing analog cores.",

          "description": "Spectral-based graph neural networks (SGNNs) have been attracting increasing\nattention in graph representation learning. However, existing SGNNs are limited\nin implementing graph filters with rigid transforms (e.g., graph Fourier or\npredefined graph wavelet transforms) and cannot adapt to signals residing on\ngraphs and tasks at hand. In this paper, we propose a novel class of graph\nneural networks that realizes graph filters with adaptive graph wavelets.\nSpecifically, the adaptive graph wavelets are learned with neural\nnetwork-parameterized lifting structures, where structure-aware attention-based\nlifting operations (i.e., prediction and update operations) are developed to\njointly consider graph structures and node features. We propose to lift based\non diffusion wavelets to alleviate the structural information loss induced by\npartitioning non-bipartite graphs. By design, the locality and sparsity of the\nresulting wavelet transform as well as the scalability of the lifting structure\nare guaranteed. We further derive a soft-thresholding filtering operation by\nlearning sparse graph representations in terms of the learned wavelets,\nyielding a localized, efficient, and scalable wavelet-based graph filters. To\nensure that the learned graph representations are invariant to node\npermutations, a layer is employed at the input of the networks to reorder the\nnodes according to their local topology information. We evaluate the proposed\nnetworks in both node-level and graph-level representation learning tasks on\nbenchmark citation and bioinformatics graph datasets. Extensive experiments\ndemonstrate the superiority of the proposed networks over existing SGNNs in\nterms of accuracy, efficiency, and scalability.",

          "description": "Real economies can be seen as a sequential imperfect-information game with\nmany heterogeneous, interacting strategic agents of various agent types, such\nas consumers, firms, and governments. Dynamic general equilibrium models are\ncommon economic tools to model the economic activity, interactions, and\noutcomes in such systems. However, existing analytical and computational\nmethods struggle to find explicit equilibria when all agents are strategic and\ninteract, while joint learning is unstable and challenging. Amongst others, a\nkey reason is that the actions of one economic agent may change the reward\nfunction of another agent, e.g., a consumer's expendable income changes when\nfirms change prices or governments change taxes. We show that multi-agent deep\nreinforcement learning (RL) can discover stable solutions that are epsilon-Nash\nequilibria for a meta-game over agent types, in economic simulations with many\nagents, through the use of structured learning curricula and efficient GPU-only\nsimulation and training. Conceptually, our approach is more flexible and does\nnot need unrealistic assumptions, e.g., market clearing, that are commonly used\nfor analytical tractability. Our GPU implementation enables training and\nanalyzing economies with a large number of agents within reasonable time\nframes, e.g., training completes within a day. We demonstrate our approach in\nreal-business-cycle models, a representative family of DGE models, with 100\nworker-consumers, 10 firms, and a government who taxes and redistributes. We\nvalidate the learned meta-game epsilon-Nash equilibria through approximate\nbest-response analyses, show that RL policies align with economic intuitions,\nand that our approach is constructive, e.g., by explicitly learning a spectrum\nof meta-game epsilon-Nash equilibria in open RBC models.",

          "description": "Approximating wind flows using computational fluid dynamics (CFD) methods can\nbe time-consuming. Creating a tool for interactively designing prototypes while\nobserving the wind flow change requires simpler models to simulate faster.\nInstead of running numerical approximations resulting in detailed calculations,\ndata-driven methods and deep learning might be able to give similar results in\na fraction of the time. This work rephrases the problem from computing 3D flow\nfields using CFD to a 2D image-to-image translation-based problem on the\nbuilding footprints to predict the flow field at pedestrian height level. We\ninvestigate the use of generative adversarial networks (GAN), such as Pix2Pix\n[1] and CycleGAN [2] representing state-of-the-art for image-to-image\ntranslation task in various domains as well as U-Net autoencoder [3].

We experiment on\nnovel simulated datasets on various three-dimensional bluff-shaped buildings\nwith and without height information. Moreover, we present an extensive\nqualitative and quantitative evaluation of the generated images for a selection\nof models and compare their performance with the simulations delivered by CFD.\nWe then show that adding positional data to the input can produce more accurate\nresults by proposing a general framework for injecting such information on the\ndifferent architectures.

          "description": "In this work we use variational inference to quantify the degree of\nuncertainty in deep learning model predictions of radio galaxy classification.\nWe show that the level of model posterior variance for individual test samples\nis correlated with human uncertainty when labelling radio galaxies. We explore\nthe model performance and uncertainty calibration for a variety of different\nweight priors and suggest that a sparse prior produces more well-calibrated\nuncertainty estimates. Using the posterior distributions for individual\nweights, we show that we can prune 30% of the fully-connected layer weights\nwithout significant loss of performance by removing the weights with the lowest\nsignal-to-noise ratio (SNR). We demonstrate that a larger degree of pruning can\nbe achieved using a Fisher information based ranking, but we note that both\npruning methods affect the uncertainty calibration for Fanaroff-Riley type I\nand type II radio galaxies differently. Finally we show that, like other work\nin this field, we experience a cold posterior effect, whereby the posterior\nmust be down-weighted to achieve good predictive performance. We examine\nwhether adapting the cost function to accommodate model misspecification can\ncompensate for this effect, but find that it does not make a significant\ndifference. We also examine the effect of principled data augmentation and find\nthat this improves upon the baseline but also does not compensate for the\nobserved effect.

          "description": "Corrupted labels and class imbalance are commonly encountered in practically\ncollected training data, which easily leads to over-fitting of deep neural\nnetworks (DNNs). Existing approaches alleviate these issues by adopting a\nsample re-weighting strategy, which is to re-weight sample by designing\nweighting function. However, it is only applicable for training data containing\nonly either one type of data biases. In practice, however, biased samples with\ncorrupted labels and of tailed classes commonly co-exist in training data. How\nto handle them simultaneously is a key but under-explored problem. In this\npaper, we find that these two types of biased samples, though have similar\ntransient loss, have distinguishable trend and characteristics in loss curves,\nwhich could provide valuable priors for sample weight assignment. Motivated by\nthis, we delve into the loss curves and propose a novel probe-and-allocate\ntraining strategy: In the probing stage, we train the network on the whole\nbiased training data without intervention, and record the loss curve of each\nsample as an additional attribute; In the allocating stage, we feed the\nresulting attribute to a newly designed curve-perception network, named\nCurveNet, to learn to identify the bias type of each sample and assign proper\nweights through meta-learning adaptively. The training speed of meta learning\nalso blocks its application. To solve it, we propose a method named skip layer\nmeta optimization (SLMO) to accelerate training speed by skipping the bottom\nlayers. Extensive synthetic and real experiments well validate the proposed\nmethod, which achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple challenging\nbenchmarks.",

          "description": "Multimodal deep learning systems which employ multiple modalities like text,\nimage, audio, video, etc., are showing better performance in comparison with\nindividual modalities (i.e., unimodal) systems. Multimodal machine learning\ninvolves multiple aspects: representation, translation, alignment, fusion, and\nco-learning. In the current state of multimodal machine learning, the\nassumptions are that all modalities are present, aligned, and noiseless during\ntraining and testing time. However, in real-world tasks, typically, it is\nobserved that one or more modalities are missing, noisy, lacking annotated\ndata, have unreliable labels, and are scarce in training or testing and or\nboth. This challenge is addressed by a learning paradigm called multimodal\nco-learning. The modeling of a (resource-poor) modality is aided by exploiting\nknowledge from another (resource-rich) modality using transfer of knowledge\nbetween modalities, including their representations and predictive models.\nCo-learning being an emerging area, there are no dedicated reviews explicitly\nfocusing on all challenges addressed by co-learning. To that end, in this work,\nwe provide a comprehensive survey on the emerging area of multimodal\nco-learning that has not been explored in its entirety yet. We review\nimplementations that overcome one or more co-learning challenges without\nexplicitly considering them as co-learning challenges. We present the\ncomprehensive taxonomy of multimodal co-learning based on the challenges\naddressed by co-learning and associated implementations.

          "description": "Molecular dynamics simulations are a cornerstone in science, allowing to\ninvestigate from the system's thermodynamics to analyse intricate molecular\ninteractions. In general, to create extended molecular trajectories can be a\ncomputationally expensive process, for example, when running $ab-initio$\nsimulations. Hence, repeating such calculations to either obtain more accurate\nthermodynamics or to get a higher resolution in the dynamics generated by a\nfine-grained quantum interaction can be time- and computationally-consuming. In\nthis work, we explore different machine learning (ML) methodologies to increase\nthe resolution of molecular dynamics trajectories on-demand within a\npost-processing step. As a proof of concept, we analyse the performance of\nbi-directional neural networks such as neural ODEs, Hamiltonian networks,\nrecurrent neural networks and LSTMs, as well as the uni-directional variants as\na reference, for molecular dynamics simulations (here: the MD17 dataset). We\nhave found that Bi-LSTMs are the best performing models; by utilizing the local\ntime-symmetry of thermostated trajectories they can even learn long-range\ncorrelations and display high robustness to noisy dynamics across molecular\ncomplexity. Our models can reach accuracies of up to 10$^{-4}$ angstroms in\ntrajectory interpolation, while faithfully reconstructing several full cycles\nof unseen intricate high-frequency molecular vibrations, rendering the\ncomparison between the learned and reference trajectories indistinguishable.\nThe results reported in this work can serve (1) as a baseline for larger\nsystems, as well as (2) for the construction of better MD integrators.",

The present work identifies two generative adversarial networks (GAN)\narchitectures that translate reversibly between plausible runway maps and\nsatellite imagery. We illustrate the training capability using paired images\n(satellite-map) from the same point of view and using the Pix2Pix architecture\nor conditional GANs. In the absence of available pairs, we likewise show that\nCycleGAN architectures with four network heads (discriminator-generator pairs)\ncan also provide effective style transfer from raw image pixels to outline or\nfeature maps. To emphasize the runway and tarmac boundaries, we experimentally\nshow that the traditional grey-tan map palette is not a required training input\nbut can be augmented by higher contrast mapping palettes (red-black) for\nsharper runway boundaries. We preview a potentially novel use case (called\n\"sketch2satellite\") where a human roughly draws the current runway boundaries\nand automates the machine output of plausible satellite images. Finally, we\nidentify examples of faulty runway maps where the published satellite and\nmapped runways disagree but an automated update renders the correct map using\nGANs.",

          "description": "In image classification, it is often expensive and time-consuming to acquire\nsufficient labels. To solve this problem, domain adaptation often provides an\nattractive option given a large amount of labeled data from a similar nature\nbut different domain. Existing approaches mainly align the distributions of\nrepresentations extracted by a single structure and the representations may\nonly contain partial information, e.g., only contain part of the saturation,\nbrightness, and hue information. Along this line, we propose\nMulti-Representation Adaptation which can dramatically improve the\nclassification accuracy for cross-domain image classification and specially\naims to align the distributions of multiple representations extracted by a\nhybrid structure named Inception Adaptation Module (IAM). Based on this, we\npresent Multi-Representation Adaptation Network (MRAN) to accomplish the\ncross-domain image classification task via multi-representation alignment which\ncan capture the information from different aspects. In addition, we extend\nMaximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) to compute the adaptation loss. Our approach can\nbe easily implemented by extending most feed-forward models with IAM, and the\nnetwork can be trained efficiently via back-propagation. Experiments conducted\non three benchmark image datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of MRAN. The\ncode has been available at https://github.com/easezyc/deep-transfer-learning.",

          "description": "Clinical 12-lead electrocardiography (ECG) is one of the most widely\nencountered kinds of biosignals. Despite the increased availability of public\nECG datasets, label scarcity remains a central challenge in the field.\nSelf-supervised learning represents a promising way to alleviate this issue. In\nthis work, we put forward the first comprehensive assessment of self-supervised\nrepresentation learning from clinical 12-lead ECG data. To this end, we adapt\nstate-of-the-art self-supervised methods based on instance discrimination and\nlatent forecasting to the ECG domain. In a first step, we learn contrastive\nrepresentations and evaluate their quality based on linear evaluation\nperformance on a recently established, comprehensive, clinical ECG\nclassification task. In a second step, we analyze the impact of self-supervised\npretraining on finetuned ECG classifiers as compared to purely supervised\nperformance. For the best-performing method, an adaptation of contrastive\npredictive coding, we find a linear evaluation performance only 0.5% below\nsupervised performance. For the finetuned models, we find improvements in\ndownstream performance of roughly 1% compared to supervised performance, label\nefficiency, as well as robustness against physiological noise. This work\nclearly establishes the feasibility of extracting discriminative\nrepresentations from ECG data via self-supervised learning and the numerous\nadvantages when finetuning such representations on downstream tasks as compared\nto purely supervised training. As first comprehensive assessment of its kind in\nthe ECG domain carried out exclusively on publicly available datasets, we hope\nto establish a first step towards reproducible progress in the rapidly evolving\nfield of representation learning for biosignals.",

Recently, deep\nlearning techniques have been successfully applied for detection of diabetic\nretinopathy (DR). The main obstacle of applying deep learning techniques to\ndetect most other retinal vascular diseases is the limited amount of data\navailable. In this paper, we propose a transfer learning technique that aims to\nutilize the feature similarities for detecting retinal vascular diseases. We\nchoose the well-studied DR detection as a source task and identify the early\ndetection of retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) as the target task. Our\nexperimental results demonstrate that our DR-pretrained approach dominates in\nall metrics the conventional ImageNet-pretrained transfer learning approach,\ncurrently adopted in medical image analysis. Moreover, our approach is more\nrobust with respect to the stochasticity in the training process and with\nrespect to reduced training samples.

Many such methods take the form of\nactor-critic with state-based critics, since centralized training allows access\nto the true system state, which can be useful during training despite not being\navailable at execution time. State-based critics have become a common empirical\nchoice, albeit one which has had limited theoretical justification or analysis.\nIn this paper, we show that state-based critics can introduce bias in the\npolicy gradient estimates, potentially undermining the asymptotic guarantees of\nthe algorithm. We also show that, even if the state-based critics do not\nintroduce any bias, they can still result in a larger gradient variance,\ncontrary to the common intuition.

In education science, self-directed\nlearning, where human learners select learning tasks and materials on their own\nwithout requiring hands-on guidance, has been shown to be more effective than\npassive teacher-guided learning. Inspired by the concept of self-directed human\nlearning, we introduce the principal concept of Self-directed Machine Learning\n(SDML) and propose a framework for SDML. Specifically, we design SDML as a\nself-directed learning process guided by self-awareness, including internal\nawareness and external awareness.

Meanwhile, the learning performance of the SDML process\nserves as feedback to further improve self-awareness. We propose a mathematical\nformulation for SDML based on multi-level optimization. Furthermore, we present\ncase studies together with potential applications of SDML, followed by\ndiscussing future research directions.

Motivated by compact operators\nappearing in boundary control and the analysis of inverse boundary value\nproblems for the wave equation, we promote structure and sparsity in selected\nweight matrices in the network. After describing this architecture, we study\nits representation properties as well as its approximation properties. We\nfurthermore show that an explicit regularization can be introduced that can be\nderived from the mathematical analysis of the mentioned inverse problems, and\nwhich leads to certain guarantees on the generalization properties. We observe\nthat the sparsity of the weight matrices improves the generalization estimates.\nLastly, we discuss how operator recurrent networks can be viewed as a deep\nlearning analogue to deterministic algorithms such as boundary control for\nreconstructing the unknown wavespeed in the acoustic wave equation from\nboundary measurements.",

          "description": "To this day, a variety of approaches for providing local interpretability of\nblack-box machine learning models have been introduced. Unfortunately, all of\nthese methods suffer from one or more of the following deficiencies: They are\neither difficult to understand themselves, they work on a per-feature basis and\nignore the dependencies between features and/or they only focus on those\nfeatures asserting the decision made by the model. To address these points,\nthis work introduces a reinforcement learning-based approach called Monte Carlo\ntree search for eXplainable Artificial Intelligent (McXai) to explain the\ndecisions of any black-box classification model (classifier). Our method\nleverages Monte Carlo tree search and models the process of generating\nexplanations as two games. In one game, the reward is maximized by finding\nfeature sets that support the decision of the classifier, while in the second\ngame, finding feature sets leading to alternative decisions maximizes the\nreward. The result is a human friendly representation as a tree structure, in\nwhich each node represents a set of features to be studied with smaller\nexplanations at the top of the tree. Our experiments show, that the features\nfound by our method are more informative with respect to classifications than\nthose found by classical approaches like LIME and SHAP. Furthermore, by also\nidentifying misleading features, our approach is able to guide towards improved\nrobustness of the black-box model in many situations.",

          "description": "Semantic segmentation of brain tumors is a fundamental medical image analysis\ntask involving multiple MRI imaging modalities that can assist clinicians in\ndiagnosing the patient and successively studying the progression of the\nmalignant entity. In recent years, Fully Convolutional Neural Networks (FCNNs)\napproaches have become the de facto standard for 3D medical image segmentation.\nThe popular \"U-shaped\" network architecture has achieved state-of-the-art\nperformance benchmarks on different 2D and 3D semantic segmentation tasks and\nacross various imaging modalities. However, due to the limited kernel size of\nconvolution layers in FCNNs, their performance of modeling long-range\ninformation is sub-optimal, and this can lead to deficiencies in the\nsegmentation of tumors with variable sizes. On the other hand, transformer\nmodels have demonstrated excellent capabilities in capturing such long-range\ninformation in multiple domains, including natural language processing and\ncomputer vision. Inspired by the success of vision transformers and their\nvariants, we propose a novel segmentation model termed Swin UNEt TRansformers\n(Swin UNETR). Specifically, the task of 3D brain tumor semantic segmentation is\nreformulated as a sequence to sequence prediction problem wherein multi-modal\ninput data is projected into a 1D sequence of embedding and used as an input to\na hierarchical Swin transformer as the encoder. The swin transformer encoder\nextracts features at five different resolutions by utilizing shifted windows\nfor computing self-attention and is connected to an FCNN-based decoder at each\nresolution via skip connections. We have participated in BraTS 2021\nsegmentation challenge, and our proposed model ranks among the top-performing\napproaches in the validation phase. Code: https://monai.io/research/swin-unetr",

          "description": "Data-driven AI systems can lead to discrimination on the basis of protected\nattributes like gender or race. One reason for this behavior is the encoded\nsocietal biases in the training data (e.g., females are underrepresented),\nwhich is aggravated in the presence of unbalanced class distributions (e.g.,\n\"granted\" is the minority class). State-of-the-art fairness-aware machine\nlearning approaches focus on preserving the \\emph{overall} classification\naccuracy while improving fairness. In the presence of class-imbalance, such\nmethods may further aggravate the problem of discrimination by denying an\nalready underrepresented group (e.g., \\textit{females}) the fundamental rights\nof equal social privileges (e.g., equal credit opportunity).\n\nTo this end, we propose AdaFair, a fairness-aware boosting ensemble that\nchanges the data distribution at each round, taking into account not only the\nclass errors but also the fairness-related performance of the model defined\ncumulatively based on the partial ensemble. Except for the in-training boosting\nof the group discriminated over each round, AdaFair directly tackles imbalance\nduring the post-training phase by optimizing the number of ensemble learners\nfor balanced error performance (BER). AdaFair can facilitate different\nparity-based fairness notions and mitigate effectively discriminatory outcomes.\nOur experiments show that our approach can achieve parity in terms of\nstatistical parity, equal opportunity, and disparate mistreatment while\nmaintaining good predictive performance for all classes.",

          "description": "Various approaches have been proposed for out-of-distribution (OOD) detection\nby augmenting models, input examples, training sets, and optimization\nobjectives. Deviating from existing work, we have a simple hypothesis that\nstandard off-the-shelf models may already contain sufficient information about\nthe training set distribution which can be leveraged for reliable OOD\ndetection. Our empirical study on validating this hypothesis, which measures\nthe model activation's mean for OOD and in-distribution (ID) mini-batches,\nsurprisingly finds that activation means of OOD mini-batches consistently\ndeviate more from those of the training data. In addition, training data's\nactivation means can be computed offline efficiently or retrieved from batch\nnormalization layers as a `free lunch'. Based upon this observation, we propose\na novel metric called Neural Mean Discrepancy (NMD), which compares neural\nmeans of the input examples and training data. Leveraging the simplicity of\nNMD, we propose an efficient OOD detector that computes neural means by a\nstandard forward pass followed by a lightweight classifier. Extensive\nexperiments show that NMD outperforms state-of-the-art OOD approaches across\nmultiple datasets and model architectures in terms of both detection accuracy\nand computational cost.",

          "description": "With the explosive growth of the e-commerce industry, detecting online\ntransaction fraud in real-world applications has become increasingly important\nto the development of e-commerce platforms. The sequential behavior history of\nusers provides useful information in differentiating fraudulent payments from\nregular ones. Recently, some approaches have been proposed to solve this\nsequence-based fraud detection problem. However, these methods usually suffer\nfrom two problems: the prediction results are difficult to explain and the\nexploitation of the internal information of behaviors is insufficient. To\ntackle the above two problems, we propose a Hierarchical Explainable Network\n(HEN) to model users' behavior sequences, which could not only improve the\nperformance of fraud detection but also make the inference process\ninterpretable. Meanwhile, as e-commerce business expands to new domains, e.g.,\nnew countries or new markets, one major problem for modeling user behavior in\nfraud detection systems is the limitation of data collection, e.g., very few\ndata/labels available. Thus, in this paper, we further propose a transfer\nframework to tackle the cross-domain fraud detection problem, which aims to\ntransfer knowledge from existing domains (source domains) with enough and\nmature data to improve the performance in the new domain (target domain). Our\nproposed method is a general transfer framework that could not only be applied\nupon HEN but also various existing models in the Embedding & MLP paradigm.\nBased on 90 transfer task experiments, we also demonstrate that our transfer\nframework could not only contribute to the cross-domain fraud detection task\nwith HEN, but also be universal and expandable for various existing models.",

          "description": "Weighting strategy prevails in machine learning. For example, a common\napproach in robust machine learning is to exert lower weights on samples which\nare likely to be noisy or quite hard. This study reveals another undiscovered\nstrategy, namely, compensating. Various incarnations of compensating have been\nutilized but it has not been explicitly revealed. Learning with compensating is\ncalled compensation learning and a systematic taxonomy is constructed for it in\nthis study. In our taxonomy, compensation learning is divided on the basis of\nthe compensation targets, directions, inference manners, and granularity\nlevels. Many existing learning algorithms including some classical ones can be\nviewed or understood at least partially as compensation techniques.\nFurthermore, a family of new learning algorithms can be obtained by plugging\nthe compensation learning into existing learning algorithms. Specifically, two\nconcrete new learning algorithms are proposed for robust machine learning.\nExtensive experiments on image classification and text sentiment analysis\nverify the effectiveness of the two new algorithms. Compensation learning can\nalso be used in other various learning scenarios, such as imbalance learning,\nclustering, regression, and so on.",

This emerging technology\nrelies on sharing ground truth labeled data between Unmanned Aerial Vehicle\n(UAV) swarms to train a high-quality automatic image recognition model.\nHowever, such an approach will bring data privacy and data availability\nchallenges. To address these issues, we first present a Semi-supervised\nFederated Learning (SSFL) framework for privacy-preserving UAV image\nrecognition.

Furthermore, there are significant\ndifferences in the number, features, and distribution of local data collected\nby UAVs using different camera modules in different environments, i.e.,\nstatistical heterogeneity. To alleviate the statistical heterogeneity problem,\nwe propose an aggregation rule based on the frequency of the client's\nparticipation in training, namely the FedFreq aggregation rule, which can\nadjust the weight of the corresponding local model according to its frequency.\nNumerical results demonstrate that the performance of our proposed method is\nsignificantly better than those of the current baseline and is robust to\ndifferent non-IID levels of client data.",

          "description": "Many few-shot learning approaches have been designed under the meta-learning\nframework, which learns from a variety of learning tasks and generalizes to new\ntasks. These meta-learning approaches achieve the expected performance in the\nscenario where all samples are drawn from the same distributions (i.i.d.\nobservations). However, in real-world applications, few-shot learning paradigm\noften suffers from data shift, i.e., samples in different tasks, even in the\nsame task, could be drawn from various data distributions. Most existing\nfew-shot learning approaches are not designed with the consideration of data\nshift, and thus show downgraded performance when data distribution shifts.\nHowever, it is non-trivial to address the data shift problem in few-shot\nlearning, due to the limited number of labeled samples in each task. Targeting\nat addressing this problem, we propose a novel metric-based meta-learning\nframework to extract task-specific representations and task-shared\nrepresentations with the help of knowledge graph. The data shift within/between\ntasks can thus be combated by the combination of task-shared and task-specific\nrepresentations.

          "description": "Deep neural networks (DNNs) are known to be vulnerable to adversarial\nattacks. A range of defense methods have been proposed to train adversarially\nrobust DNNs, among which adversarial training has demonstrated promising\nresults. However, despite preliminary understandings developed for adversarial\ntraining, it is still not clear, from the architectural perspective, what\nconfigurations can lead to more robust DNNs. In this paper, we address this gap\nvia a comprehensive investigation on the impact of network width and depth on\nthe robustness of adversarially trained DNNs. Specifically, we make the\nfollowing key observations: 1) more parameters (higher model capacity) does not\nnecessarily help adversarial robustness; 2) reducing capacity at the last stage\n(the last group of blocks) of the network can actually improve adversarial\nrobustness; and 3) under the same parameter budget, there exists an optimal\narchitectural configuration for adversarial robustness. We also provide a\ntheoretical analysis explaning why such network configuration can help\nrobustness. These architectural insights can help design adversarially robust\nDNNs.

Incorporating such additional conditioning factors\nwould require rebuilding the entire architecture and optimizing the parameters\nfrom scratch.

          "description": "Despite Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have achieved remarkable accuracy,\nwhether the results are trustworthy is still unexplored. Previous studies\nsuggest that many modern neural networks are over-confident on the predictions,\nhowever, surprisingly, we discover that GNNs are primarily in the opposite\ndirection, i.e., GNNs are under-confident. Therefore, the confidence\ncalibration for GNNs is highly desired. In this paper, we propose a novel\ntrustworthy GNN model by designing a topology-aware post-hoc calibration\nfunction. Specifically, we first verify that the confidence distribution in a\ngraph has homophily property, and this finding inspires us to design a\ncalibration GNN model (CaGCN) to learn the calibration function. CaGCN is able\nto obtain a unique transformation from logits of GNNs to the calibrated\nconfidence for each node, meanwhile, such transformation is able to preserve\nthe order between classes, satisfying the accuracy-preserving property.\nMoreover, we apply the calibration GNN to self-training framework, showing that\nmore trustworthy pseudo labels can be obtained with the calibrated confidence\nand further improve the performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate the\neffectiveness of our proposed model in terms of both calibration and accuracy.",

          "description": "Recent advances in deep reinforcement learning (RL) have led to considerable\nprogress in many 2-player zero-sum games, such as Go, Poker and Starcraft. The\npurely adversarial nature of such games allows for conceptually simple and\nprincipled application of RL methods. However real-world settings are\nmany-agent, and agent interactions are complex mixtures of common-interest and\ncompetitive aspects. We consider Diplomacy, a 7-player board game designed to\naccentuate dilemmas resulting from many-agent interactions. It also features a\nlarge combinatorial action space and simultaneous moves, which are challenging\nfor RL algorithms. We propose a simple yet effective approximate best response\noperator, designed to handle large combinatorial action spaces and simultaneous\nmoves. We also introduce a family of policy iteration methods that approximate\nfictitious play. With these methods, we successfully apply RL to Diplomacy: we\nshow that our agents convincingly outperform the previous state-of-the-art, and\ngame theoretic equilibrium analysis shows that the new process yields\nconsistent improvements.",

Then we explain why\nadversarial training performs better than data augmentation with simple\nGaussian noise which has been observed to be a meaningful baseline on common\ncorruptions. Related to this, we identify the $\\sigma$-overfitting phenomenon\nwhen Gaussian augmentation overfits to a particular standard deviation used for\ntraining which has a significant detrimental effect on common corruption\naccuracy. We discuss how to alleviate this problem and then how to further\nenhance $\\ell_p$ adversarial training by introducing an efficient relaxation of\nadversarial training with learned perceptual image patch similarity as the\ndistance metric. Through experiments on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet-100, we show that\nour approach does not only improve the $\\ell_p$ adversarial training baseline\nbut also has cumulative gains with data augmentation methods such as AugMix,\nDeepAugment, ANT, and SIN, leading to state-of-the-art performance on common\ncorruptions.\n\nThe code of our experiments is publicly available at\nhttps://github.com/tml-epfl/adv-training-corruptions.",

          "description": "Light field (LF) imaging, which captures both spatial and angular information\nof a scene, is undoubtedly beneficial to numerous applications. Although\nvarious techniques have been proposed for LF acquisition, achieving both\nangularly and spatially high-resolution LF remains a technology challenge. In\nthis paper, a learning-based approach applied to 3D epipolar image (EPI) is\nproposed to reconstruct high-resolution LF. Through a 2-stage super-resolution\nframework, the proposed approach effectively addresses various LF\nsuper-resolution (SR) problems, i.e., spatial SR, angular SR, and\nangular-spatial SR. While the first stage provides flexible options to\nup-sample EPI volume to the desired resolution, the second stage, which\nconsists of a novel EPI volume-based refinement network (EVRN), substantially\nenhances the quality of the high-resolution EPI volume. An extensive evaluation\non 90 challenging synthetic and real-world light field scenes from 7 published\ndatasets shows that the proposed approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods\nto a large extend for both spatial and angular super-resolution problem, i.e.,\nan average peak signal to noise ratio improvement of more than 2.0 dB, 1.4 dB,\nand 3.14 dB in spatial SR $\\times 2$, spatial SR $\\times 4$, and angular SR\nrespectively.

This species\nrecognition task is an important information source and scientific pillar for\nreconstructing past climates. All foraminifer CNN recognition pipelines in the\nliterature produce black-box classifiers that lack visualisation options for\nhuman experts and cannot be applied to open set problems. Here, we benchmark\nmetric learning against these pipelines, produce the first scientific\nvisualisation of the phenotypic planktic foraminifer morphology space, and\ndemonstrate that metric learning can be used to cluster species unseen during\ntraining. We show that metric learning out-performs all published CNN-based\nstate-of-the-art benchmarks in this domain. We evaluate our approach on the\n34,640 expert-annotated images of the Endless Forams public library of 35\nmodern planktic foraminifera species.

          "description": "One principal impediment in the successful deployment of AI-based\nComputer-Aided Diagnosis (CAD) systems in clinical workflows is their lack of\ntransparent decision making. Although commonly used eXplainable AI methods\nprovide some insight into opaque algorithms, such explanations are usually\nconvoluted and not readily comprehensible except by highly trained experts. The\nexplanation of decisions regarding the malignancy of skin lesions from\ndermoscopic images demands particular clarity, as the underlying medical\nproblem definition is itself ambiguous. This work presents ExAID (Explainable\nAI for Dermatology), a novel framework for biomedical image analysis, providing\nmulti-modal concept-based explanations consisting of easy-to-understand textual\nexplanations supplemented by visual maps justifying the predictions. ExAID\nrelies on Concept Activation Vectors to map human concepts to those learnt by\narbitrary Deep Learning models in latent space, and Concept Localization Maps\nto highlight concepts in the input space. This identification of relevant\nconcepts is then used to construct fine-grained textual explanations\nsupplemented by concept-wise location information to provide comprehensive and\ncoherent multi-modal explanations. All information is comprehensively presented\nin a diagnostic interface for use in clinical routines. An educational mode\nprovides dataset-level explanation statistics and tools for data and model\nexploration to aid medical research and education. Through rigorous\nquantitative and qualitative evaluation of ExAID, we show the utility of\nmulti-modal explanations for CAD-assisted scenarios even in case of wrong\npredictions. We believe that ExAID will provide dermatologists an effective\nscreening tool that they both understand and trust.

          "description": "Imbalanced datasets are commonplace in modern machine learning problems. The\npresence of under-represented classes or groups with sensitive attributes\nresults in concerns about generalization and fairness. Such concerns are\nfurther exacerbated by the fact that large capacity deep nets can perfectly fit\nthe training data and appear to achieve perfect accuracy and fairness during\ntraining, but perform poorly during test. To address these challenges, we\npropose AutoBalance, a bi-level optimization framework that automatically\ndesigns a training loss function to optimize a blend of accuracy and\nfairness-seeking objectives. Specifically, a lower-level problem trains the\nmodel weights, and an upper-level problem tunes the loss function by monitoring\nand optimizing the desired objective over the validation data. Our loss design\nenables personalized treatment for classes/groups by employing a parametric\ncross-entropy loss and individualized data augmentation schemes. We evaluate\nthe benefits and performance of our approach for the application scenarios of\nimbalanced and group-sensitive classification. Extensive empirical evaluations\ndemonstrate the benefits of AutoBalance over state-of-the-art approaches. Our\nexperimental findings are complemented with theoretical insights on loss\nfunction design and the benefits of train-validation split. All code is\navailable open-source.",

          "description": "The field of Continual Learning (CL) seeks to develop algorithms that\naccumulate knowledge and skills over time through interaction with\nnon-stationary environments. In practice, a plethora of evaluation procedures\n(settings) and algorithmic solutions (methods) exist, each with their own\npotentially disjoint set of assumptions. This variety makes measuring progress\nin CL difficult. We propose a taxonomy of settings, where each setting is\ndescribed as a set of assumptions. A tree-shaped hierarchy emerges from this\nview, where more general settings become the parents of those with more\nrestrictive assumptions. This makes it possible to use inheritance to share and\nreuse research, as developing a method for a given setting also makes it\ndirectly applicable onto any of its children. We instantiate this idea as a\npublicly available software framework called Sequoia, which features a wide\nvariety of settings from both the Continual Supervised Learning (CSL) and\nContinual Reinforcement Learning (CRL) domains. Sequoia also includes a growing\nsuite of methods which are easy to extend and customize, in addition to more\nspecialized methods from external libraries. We hope that this new paradigm and\nits first implementation can help unify and accelerate research in CL. You can\nhelp us grow the tree by visiting github.com/lebrice/Sequoia.",

Our\nmethod is built upon recent neural scene representation and rendering works\nwhich learn representations of geometry and appearance from only 2D images.\nWhile existing works demonstrated compelling rendering of static scenes and\nplayback of dynamic scenes, photo-realistic reconstruction and rendering of\nhumans with neural implicit methods, in particular under user-controlled novel\nposes, is still difficult. To address this problem, we utilize a coarse body\nmodel as the proxy to unwarp the surrounding 3D space into a canonical pose. A\nneural radiance field learns pose-dependent geometric deformations and pose-\nand view-dependent appearance effects in the canonical space from multi-view\nvideo input. To synthesize novel views of high fidelity dynamic geometry and\nappearance, we leverage 2D texture maps defined on the body model as latent\nvariables for predicting residual deformations and the dynamic appearance.\nExperiments demonstrate that our method achieves better quality than the\nstate-of-the-arts on playback as well as novel pose synthesis, and can even\ngeneralize well to new poses that starkly differ from the training poses.\nFurthermore, our method also supports body shape control of the synthesized\nresults.",

          "description": "Learning to optimize the area under the receiver operating characteristics\ncurve (AUC) performance for imbalanced data has attracted much attention in\nrecent years. Although there have been several methods of AUC optimization,\nscaling up AUC optimization is still an open issue due to its pairwise learning\nstyle. Maximizing AUC in the large-scale dataset can be considered as a\nnon-convex and expensive problem. Inspired by the characteristic of pairwise\nlearning, the cheap AUC optimization task with a small-scale dataset sampled\nfrom the large-scale dataset is constructed to promote the AUC accuracy of the\noriginal, large-scale, and expensive AUC optimization task. This paper develops\nan evolutionary multitasking framework (termed EMTAUC) to make full use of\ninformation among the constructed cheap and expensive tasks to obtain higher\nperformance. In EMTAUC, one mission is to optimize AUC from the sampled\ndataset, and the other is to maximize AUC from the original dataset. Moreover,\ndue to the cheap task containing limited knowledge, a strategy for dynamically\nadjusting the data structure of inexpensive tasks is proposed to introduce more\nknowledge into the multitasking AUC optimization environment. The performance\nof the proposed method is evaluated on a series of binary classification\ndatasets. The experimental results demonstrate that EMTAUC is highly\ncompetitive to single task methods and online methods. Supplementary materials\nand source code implementation of EMTAUC can be accessed at\nhttps://github.com/xiaofangxd/EMTAUC.",

          "description": "This paper deals with the following important research question.\nTraditionally, the neural network employs non-linear activation functions\nconcatenated with linear operators to approximate a given physical phenomenon.\nThey \"fill the space\" with the concatenations of the activation functions and\nlinear operators and adjust their coefficients to approximate the physical\nphenomena. We claim that it is better to \"fill the space\" with linear\ncombinations of smooth higher-order B-splines base functions as employed by\nisogeometric analysis and utilize the neural networks to adjust the\ncoefficients of linear combinations. In other words, the possibilities of using\nneural networks for approximating the B-spline base functions' coefficients and\nby approximating the solution directly are evaluated. Solving differential\nequations with neural networks has been proposed by Maziar Raissi et al. in\n2017 by introducing Physics-informed Neural Networks (PINN), which naturally\nencode underlying physical laws as prior information. Approximation of\ncoefficients using a function as an input leverages the well-known capability\nof neural networks being universal function approximators. In essence, in the\nPINN approach the network approximates the value of the given field at a given\npoint. We present an alternative approach, where the physcial quantity is\napproximated as a linear combination of smooth B-spline basis functions, and\nthe neural network approximates the coefficients of B-splines. This research\ncompares results from the DNN approximating the coefficients of the linear\ncombination of B-spline basis functions, with the DNN approximating the\nsolution directly. We show that our approach is cheaper and more accurate when\napproximating smooth physical fields.",

          "description": "Normalization techniques have become a basic component in modern\nconvolutional neural networks (ConvNets). In particular, many recent works\ndemonstrate that promoting the orthogonality of the weights helps train deep\nmodels and improve robustness. For ConvNets, most existing methods are based on\npenalizing or normalizing weight matrices derived from concatenating or\nflattening the convolutional kernels. These methods often destroy or ignore the\nbenign convolutional structure of the kernels; therefore, they are often\nexpensive or impractical for deep ConvNets. In contrast, we introduce a simple\nand efficient \"Convolutional Normalization\" (ConvNorm) method that can fully\nexploit the convolutional structure in the Fourier domain and serve as a simple\nplug-and-play module to be conveniently incorporated into any ConvNets. Our\nmethod is inspired by recent work on preconditioning methods for convolutional\nsparse coding and can effectively promote each layer's channel-wise isometry.\nFurthermore, we show that our ConvNorm can reduce the layerwise spectral norm\nof the weight matrices and hence improve the Lipschitzness of the network,\nleading to easier training and improved robustness for deep ConvNets. Applied\nto classification under noise corruptions and generative adversarial network\n(GAN), we show that the ConvNorm improves the robustness of common ConvNets\nsuch as ResNet and the performance of GAN. We verify our findings via numerical\nexperiments on CIFAR and ImageNet.",

          "description": "We deal with Bayesian generative and discriminative classifiers. Given a\nmodel distribution $p(x, y)$, with the observation $y$ and the target $x$, one\ncomputes generative classifiers by firstly considering $p(x, y)$ and then using\nthe Bayes rule to calculate $p(x | y)$. A discriminative model is directly\ngiven by $p(x | y)$, which is used to compute discriminative classifiers.\nHowever, recent works showed that the Bayesian Maximum Posterior classifier\ndefined from the Naive Bayes (NB) or Hidden Markov Chain (HMC), both generative\nmodels, can also match the discriminative classifier definition. Thus, there\nare situations in which dividing classifiers into \"generative\" and\n\"discriminative\" is somewhat misleading. Indeed, such a distinction is rather\nrelated to the way of computing classifiers, not to the classifiers themselves.\nWe present a general theoretical result specifying how a generative classifier\ninduced from a generative model can also be computed in a discriminative way\nfrom the same model. Examples of NB and HMC are found again as particular\ncases, and we apply the general result to two original extensions of NB, and\ntwo extensions of HMC, one of which being original. Finally, we shortly\nillustrate the interest of the new discriminative way of computing classifiers\nin the Natural Language Processing (NLP) framework.",

          "description": "Fluorescence microscopy has been a significant tool to observe long-term\nimaging of embryos (in vivo) growth over time. However, cumulative exposure is\nphototoxic to such sensitive live samples. While techniques like light-sheet\nfluorescence microscopy (LSFM) allow for reduced exposure, it is not well\nsuited for deep imaging models. Other computational techniques are\ncomputationally expensive and often lack restoration quality. To address this\nchallenge, one can use various low-dosage imaging techniques that are developed\nto achieve the 3D volume reconstruction using a few slices in the axial\ndirection (z-axis); however, they often lack restoration quality. Also,\nacquiring dense images (with small steps) in the axial direction is\ncomputationally expensive. To address this challenge, we present a compressive\nsensing (CS) based approach to fully reconstruct 3D volumes with the same\nsignal-to-noise ratio (SNR) with less than half of the excitation dosage. We\npresent the theory and experimentally validate the approach. To demonstrate our\ntechnique, we capture a 3D volume of the RFP labeled neurons in the zebrafish\nembryo spinal cord (30um thickness) with the axial sampling of 0.1um using a\nconfocal microscope. From the results, we observe the CS-based approach\nachieves accurate 3D volume reconstruction from less than 20% of the entire\nstack optical sections. The developed CS-based methodology in this work can be\neasily applied to other deep imaging modalities such as two-photon and\nlight-sheet microscopy, where reducing sample photo-toxicity is a critical\nchallenge.",

          "description": "Location data collected from mobile devices represent mobility behaviors at\nindividual and societal levels. These data have important applications ranging\nfrom transportation planning to epidemic modeling. However, issues must be\novercome to best serve these use cases: The data often represent a limited\nsample of the population and use of the data jeopardizes privacy.\n\nTo address these issues, we present and evaluate a system for generating\nsynthetic mobility data using a deep recurrent neural network (RNN) which is\ntrained on real location data. The system takes a population distribution as\ninput and generates mobility traces for a corresponding synthetic population.\n\nRelated generative approaches have not solved the challenges of capturing\nboth the patterns and variability in individuals' mobility behaviors over\nlonger time periods, while also balancing the generation of realistic data with\nprivacy. Our system leverages RNNs' ability to generate complex and novel\nsequences while retaining patterns from training data. Also, the model\nintroduces randomness used to calibrate the variation between the synthetic and\nreal data at the individual level. This is to both capture variability in human\nmobility, and protect user privacy.\n\nLocation based services (LBS) data from more than 22,700 mobile devices were\nused in an experimental evaluation across utility and privacy metrics.

          "description": "Fine-grained IP geolocation systems often rely on some linear delay-distance\nrules. They are not easy to generalize in network environments where the\ndelay-distance relationship is non-linear. Recently, researchers begin to pay\nattention to learning-based IP geolocation systems. These data-driven\nalgorithms leverage multi-layer perceptron (MLP) to model non-linear\nrelationships. However, MLP is not so suitable for modeling computer networks\nbecause networks are fundamentally graph-typed data. MLP-based IP geolocation\nsystems only treat IP addresses as isolated data instances, forgoing the\nconnection information between IP addresses. This would lead to sub-optimal\nrepresentations and limit the geolocation performance.\n\nGraph convolutional network (GCN) is an emerging deep learning method for\ngraph-typed data presentation. In this work, we research how to model computer\nnetworks for fine-grained IP geolocation with GCN. First, we formulate the IP\ngeolocation task as an attributed graph node regression problem. Then, a\nGCN-based IP geolocation system named GCN-Geo is proposed to predict the\nlocation of each IP address. GCN-Geo consists of a preprocessor, an encoder,\ngraph convolutional (GC) layers and a decoder. The preprocessor and the encoder\ntransform raw measurement data into the initial graph embeddings. GC layers\nrefine the initial graph node embeddings by explicitly modeling the connection\ninformation between IP addresses. The proposed decoder can relieve the\nconverging problem of GCN-Geo by considering some prior knowledge about target\nIP addresses. Finally, the experimental results in three real-world datasets\nshow that: GCN-Geo clearly outperforms the state-of-art rule-based and\nlearning-based baselines on all three datasets w.r.t. average, median and max\nerror distances. This work verifies the potential of GCN in fine-grained IP\ngeolocation.",

Specifically, we experimentally\nshow that directly encouraging CIL Learner at the initial phase to output\nsimilar representations as the model jointly trained on all classes can greatly\nboost the CIL performance. Motivated by this, we study the difference between a\nna\\\"ively-trained initial-phase model and the oracle model.

          "description": "The Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture is showing promising results in\nimproving parameter sharing in multi-task learning (MTL) and in scaling\nhigh-capacity neural networks. State-of-the-art MoE models use a trainable\nsparse gate to select a subset of the experts for each input example. While\nconceptually appealing, existing sparse gates, such as Top-k, are not smooth.\nThe lack of smoothness can lead to convergence and statistical performance\nissues when training with gradient-based methods. In this paper, we develop\nDSelect-k: a continuously differentiable and sparse gate for MoE, based on a\nnovel binary encoding formulation. The gate can be trained using first-order\nmethods, such as stochastic gradient descent, and offers explicit control over\nthe number of experts to select. We demonstrate the effectiveness of DSelect-k\non both synthetic and real MTL datasets with up to $128$ tasks. Our experiments\nindicate that DSelect-k can achieve statistically significant improvements in\nprediction and expert selection over popular MoE gates. Notably, on a\nreal-world, large-scale recommender system, DSelect-k achieves over $22\\%$\nimprovement in predictive performance compared to Top-k. We provide an\nopen-source implementation of DSelect-k.",

In this\npaper, we analyze the training and generalization for RNNs with random\ninitialization, and provide the following improvements over recent works:\n\n1) For a RNN with input sequence $x=(X_1,X_2,...,X_L)$, previous works study\nto learn functions that are summation of $f(\\beta^T_lX_l)$ and require\nnormalized conditions that $||X_l||\\leq\\epsilon$ with some very small\n$\\epsilon$ depending on the complexity of $f$. In this paper, using detailed\nanalysis about the neural tangent kernel matrix, we prove a generalization\nerror bound to learn such functions without normalized conditions and show that\nsome notable concept classes are learnable with the numbers of iterations and\nsamples scaling almost-polynomially in the input length $L$.\n\n2) Moreover, we prove a novel result to learn N-variables functions of input\nsequence with the form $f(\\beta^T[X_{l_1},...,X_{l_N}])$, which do not belong\nto the \"additive\" concept class, i,e., the summation of function $f(X_l)$.

          "description": "In Federated Learning, a common approach for aggregating local models across\nclients is periodic averaging of the full model parameters. It is, however,\nknown that different layers of neural networks can have a different degree of\nmodel discrepancy across the clients. The conventional full aggregation scheme\ndoes not consider such a difference and synchronizes the whole model parameters\nat once, resulting in inefficient network bandwidth consumption. Aggregating\nthe parameters that are similar across the clients does not make meaningful\ntraining progress while increasing the communication cost. We propose FedLAMA,\na layer-wise model aggregation scheme for scalable Federated Learning. FedLAMA\nadaptively adjusts the aggregation interval in a layer-wise manner, jointly\nconsidering the model discrepancy and the communication cost. The layer-wise\naggregation method enables to finely control the aggregation interval to relax\nthe aggregation frequency without a significant impact on the model accuracy.\nOur empirical study shows that FedLAMA reduces the communication cost by up to\n60% for IID data and 70% for non-IID data while achieving a comparable accuracy\nto FedAvg.",

In order to address this additional goal, we examine approaches\nfor improving the user experience by constraining the number of interventions\nby the autonomous agent. We propose two model-free reinforcement learning\nmethods that can account for both hard and soft constraints on the number of\ninterventions.

In contrast to the common belief that this provides privacy benefits,\nwe here add to the very recent results on privacy risks when sharing gradients.\nSpecifically, we investigate Label Leakage from Gradients (LLG), a novel attack\nto extract the labels of the users' training data from their shared gradients.\nThe attack exploits the direction and magnitude of gradients to determine the\npresence or absence of any label. LLG is simple yet effective, capable of\nleaking potential sensitive information represented by labels, and scales well\nto arbitrary batch sizes and multiple classes. We mathematically and\nempirically demonstrate the validity of the attack under different settings.\nMoreover, empirical results show that LLG successfully extracts labels with\nhigh accuracy at the early stages of model training.

          "description": "Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have shown advantages in various graph-based\napplications. Most existing GNNs assume strong homophily of graph structure and\napply permutation-invariant local aggregation of neighbors to learn a\nrepresentation for each node. However, they fail to generalize to heterophilic\ngraphs, where most neighboring nodes have different labels or features, and the\nrelevant nodes are distant. Few recent studies attempt to address this problem\nby combining multiple hops of hidden representations of central nodes (i.e.,\nmulti-hop-based approaches) or sorting the neighboring nodes based on attention\nscores (i.e., ranking-based approaches). As a result, these approaches have\nsome apparent limitations. On the one hand, multi-hop-based approaches do not\nexplicitly distinguish relevant nodes from a large number of multi-hop\nneighborhoods, leading to a severe over-smoothing problem. On the other hand,\nranking-based models do not joint-optimize node ranking with end tasks and\nresult in sub-optimal solutions. In this work, we present Graph Pointer Neural\nNetworks (GPNN) to tackle the challenges mentioned above. We leverage a pointer\nnetwork to select the most relevant nodes from a large amount of multi-hop\nneighborhoods, which constructs an ordered sequence according to the\nrelationship with the central node. 1D convolution is then applied to extract\nhigh-level features from the node sequence. The pointer-network-based ranker in\nGPNN is joint-optimized with other parts in an end-to-end manner. Extensive\nexperiments are conducted on six public node classification datasets with\nheterophilic graphs. The results show that GPNN significantly improves the\nclassification performance of state-of-the-art methods. In addition, analyses\nalso reveal the privilege of the proposed GPNN in filtering out irrelevant\nneighbors and reducing over-smoothing.",

Here, we prove that physical quantum circuits are PAC (probably\napproximately correct) learnable on a quantum computer via empirical risk\nminimization: to learn a parametric quantum circuit with at most $n^c$ gates\nand each gate acting on a constant number of qubits, the sample complexity is\nbounded by $\\tilde{O}(n^{c+1})$. In particular, we explicitly construct a\nfamily of variational quantum circuits with $O(n^{c+1})$ elementary gates\narranged in a fixed pattern, which can represent all physical quantum circuits\nconsisting of at most $n^c$ elementary gates.

          "description": "Bayesian Optimization algorithm has become a promising approach for nonlinear\nglobal optimization problems and many machine learning applications. Over the\npast few years, improvements and enhancements have been brought forward and\nthey have shown some promising results in solving the complex dynamic problems,\nsystems of ordinary differential equations where the objective functions are\ncomputationally expensive to evaluate. Besides, the straightforward\nimplementation of the Bayesian Optimization algorithm performs well merely for\noptimization problems with 10-20 dimensions. The study presented in this paper\nproposes a new high dimensional Bayesian Optimization algorithm combining\nRecurrent neural networks, which is expected to predict the optimal solution\nfor the global optimization problems with high dimensional or time series\ndecision models. The proposed RNN-BO algorithm can solve the optimal control\nproblems in the lower dimension space and then learn from the historical data\nusing the recurrent neural network to learn the historical optimal solution\ndata and predict the optimal control strategy for any new initial system value\nsetting. In addition, accurately and quickly providing the optimal control\nstrategy is essential to effectively and efficiently control the epidemic\nspread while minimizing the associated financial costs. Therefore, to verify\nthe effectiveness of the proposed algorithm, computational experiments are\ncarried out on a deterministic SEIR epidemic model and a stochastic SIS optimal\ncontrol model. Finally, we also discuss the impacts of different numbers of the\nRNN layers and training epochs on the trade-off between solution quality and\nrelated computational efforts.",

          "description": "Acute and chronic wounds with varying etiologies burden the healthcare\nsystems economically. The advanced wound care market is estimated to reach $22\nbillion by 2024. Wound care professionals provide proper diagnosis and\ntreatment with heavy reliance on images and image documentation. Segmentation\nof wound boundaries in images is a key component of the care and diagnosis\nprotocol since it is important to estimate the area of the wound and provide\nquantitative measurement for the treatment. Unfortunately, this process is very\ntime-consuming and requires a high level of expertise. Recently automatic wound\nsegmentation methods based on deep learning have shown promising performance\nbut require large datasets for training and it is unclear which methods perform\nbetter. To address these issues, we propose the Foot Ulcer Segmentation\nchallenge (FUSeg) organized in conjunction with the 2021 International\nConference on Medical Image Computing and Computer Assisted Intervention\n(MICCAI). We built a wound image dataset containing 1,210 foot ulcer images\ncollected over 2 years from 889 patients. It is pixel-wise annotated by wound\ncare experts and split into a training set with 1010 images and a testing set\nwith 200 images for evaluation. Teams around the world developed automated\nmethods to predict wound segmentations on the testing set of which annotations\nwere kept private. The predictions were evaluated and ranked based on the\naverage Dice coefficient. The FUSeg challenge remains an open challenge as a\nbenchmark for wound segmentation after the conference.",

We propose a loss function based on the Information Bottleneck\nprinciple and a max-margin loss with an aim to increase the class separability\nin the embedded space. While deep neural network models have excelled in\nsupervised learning tasks with large-scale labeled data available, they are\nprone to practical issues in testing samples outside of classes shown in\ntraining, e.g., anomaly detection and out-of-distribution detection. In such\ntasks, it is not sufficient to merely discriminate between known classes. Our\nintuition is to represent the known classes in compact and separated embedded\nregions in order to decrease the possibility of known and unseen classes\nlargely overlapping in the embedded space. We show that the IB-based loss\nfunction reflects the inter-class distances as well as the compactness within\nclasses, thus will extend the extending models of the existing deep data\ndescription models. Our empirical study shows that the proposed model improves\nthe segmentation of normal classes in the deep feature space which contributes\nto identifying the out-of-distribution samples.",

          "description": "Objective: With the rapid rise of wearable sleep monitoring devices with\nnon-conventional electrode configurations, there is a need for automated\nalgorithms that can perform sleep staging on configurations with small amounts\nof labeled data. Transfer learning has the ability to adapt neural network\nweights from a source modality (e.g. standard electrode configuration) to a new\ntarget modality (e.g. non-conventional electrode configuration). Methods: We\npropose feature matching, a new transfer learning strategy as an alternative to\nthe commonly used finetuning approach. This method consists of training a model\nwith larger amounts of data from the source modality and few paired samples of\nsource and target modality. For those paired samples, the model extracts\nfeatures of the target modality, matching these to the features from the\ncorresponding samples of the source modality. Results: We compare feature\nmatching to finetuning for three different target domains, with two different\nneural network architectures, and with varying amounts of training data.\nParticularly on small cohorts (i.e. 2 - 5 labeled recordings in the\nnon-conventional recording setting), feature matching systematically\noutperforms finetuning with mean relative differences in accuracy ranging from\n0.4% to 4.7% for the different scenarios and datasets. Conclusion: Our findings\nsuggest that feature matching outperforms finetuning as a transfer learning\napproach, especially in very low data regimes. Significance: As such, we\nconclude that feature matching is a promising new method for wearable sleep\nstaging with novel devices.",

          "description": "The widely applied density peak clustering (DPC) algorithm makes an intuitive\ncluster formation assumption that cluster centers are often surrounded by data\npoints with lower local density and far away from other data points with higher\nlocal density. However, this assumption suffers from one limitation that it is\noften problematic when identifying clusters with lower density because they\nmight be easily merged into other clusters with higher density. As a result,\nDPC may not be able to identify clusters with variational density. To address\nthis issue, we propose a variational density peak clustering (VDPC) algorithm,\nwhich is designed to systematically and autonomously perform the clustering\ntask on datasets with various types of density distributions. Specifically, we\nfirst propose a novel method to identify the representatives among all data\npoints and construct initial clusters based on the identified representatives\nfor further analysis of the clusters' property. Furthermore, we divide all data\npoints into different levels according to their local density and propose a\nunified clustering framework by combining the advantages of both DPC and\nDBSCAN. Thus, all the identified initial clusters spreading across different\ndensity levels are systematically processed to form the final clusters. To\nevaluate the effectiveness of the proposed VDPC algorithm, we conduct extensive\nexperiments using 20 datasets including eight synthetic, six real-world and six\nimage datasets. The experimental results show that VDPC outperforms two\nclassical algorithms (i.e., DPC and DBSCAN) and four state-of-the-art extended\nDPC algorithms.",

Similarly, based on\n$F$, the classical Frank-Wolfe algorithm equipped with variance reduction\ntechnique \\citep{mokhtari2018conditional} also returns a solution with\nobjective value larger than $(1-e^{-\\gamma}-\\epsilon^{2})OPT-\\epsilon$ after\n$O(1/\\epsilon^{3})$ iterations. In the online setting, we first consider the\nadversarial delays for stochastic gradient feedback, under which we propose a\nboosting online gradient algorithm with the same non-oblivious search,\nachieving a regret of $\\sqrt{D}$ (where $D$ is the sum of delays of gradient\nfeedback) against a $(1-e^{-\\gamma})$-approximation to the best feasible\nsolution in hindsight. Finally, extensive numerical experiments demonstrate the\nefficiency of our boosting methods.",

One practical solution is\nto assign confidence scores to each prediction, then use these scores to filter\nout possible misclassifications. However, existing confidence metrics are not\nyet sufficiently reliable for this role. This paper presents a new framework\nthat produces a quantitative metric for detecting misclassification errors.\nThis framework, RED, builds an error detector on top of the base classifier and\nestimates uncertainty of the detection scores using Gaussian Processes.\nExperimental comparisons with other error detection methods on 125 UCI datasets\ndemonstrate that this approach is effective. Further implementations on two\nprobabilistic base classifiers and two large deep learning architecture in\nvision tasks further confirm that the method is robust and scalable. Third, an\nempirical analysis of RED with out-of-distribution and adversarial samples\nshows that the method can be used not only to detect errors but also to\nunderstand where they come from. RED can thereby be used to improve\ntrustworthiness of neural network classifiers more broadly in the future.",

          "description": "Devising dynamic pricing policy with always valid online statistical learning\nprocedure is an important and as yet unresolved problem. Most existing dynamic\npricing policy, which focus on the faithfulness of adopted customer choice\nmodels, exhibit a limited capability for adapting the online uncertainty of\nlearned statistical model during pricing process. In this paper, we propose a\nnovel approach for designing dynamic pricing policy based regularized online\nstatistical learning with theoretical guarantees. The new approach overcomes\nthe challenge of continuous monitoring of online Lasso procedure and possesses\nseveral appealing properties. In particular, we make the decisive observation\nthat the always-validity of pricing decisions builds and thrives on the online\nregularization scheme. Our proposed online regularization scheme equips the\nproposed optimistic online regularized maximum likelihood pricing (OORMLP)\npricing policy with three major advantages: encode market noise knowledge into\npricing process optimism; empower online statistical learning with\nalways-validity over all decision points; envelop prediction error process with\ntime-uniform non-asymptotic oracle inequalities. This type of non-asymptotic\ninference results allows us to design more sample-efficient and robust dynamic\npricing algorithms in practice. In theory, the proposed OORMLP algorithm\nexploits the sparsity structure of high-dimensional models and secures a\nlogarithmic regret in a decision horizon. These theoretical advances are made\npossible by proposing an optimistic online Lasso procedure that resolves\ndynamic pricing problems at the process level, based on a novel use of\nnon-asymptotic martingale concentration. In experiments, we evaluate OORMLP in\ndifferent synthetic and real pricing problem settings, and demonstrate that\nOORMLP advances the state-of-the-art methods.",

However, CNNs are\nprone to depend on low-level features that humans deem non-semantic. This\ndependency has been conjectured to induce a lack of robustness to image\nperturbations or domain shift. In this paper, we show that by generating\ncarefully designed negative samples, contrastive learning can learn more robust\nrepresentations with less dependence on such features. Contrastive learning\nutilizes positive pairs that preserve semantic information while perturbing\nsuperficial features in the training images. Similarly, we propose to generate\nnegative samples in a reversed way, where only the superfluous instead of the\nsemantic features are preserved. We develop two methods, texture-based and\npatch-based augmentations, to generate negative samples. These samples achieve\nbetter generalization, especially under out-of-domain settings. We also analyze\nour method and the generated texture-based samples, showing that texture\nfeatures are indispensable in classifying particular ImageNet classes and\nespecially finer classes.

A key motivation for the use of GNNs in the\nsupervised learning setting is their applicability to large graphs, but this\nbenefit has not yet been realised for locomotion control. We identify the\nweakness with a common GNN architecture that causes this poor scaling:\noverfitting in the MLPs within the network that encode, decode, and propagate\nmessages. To combat this, we introduce Snowflake, a GNN training method for\nhigh-dimensional continuous control that freezes parameters in parts of the\nnetwork that suffer from overfitting. Snowflake significantly boosts the\nperformance of GNNs for locomotion control on large agents, now matching the\nperformance of MLPs, and with superior transfer properties.",

QMIX, a widely popular MARL algorithm, has been used as a\nbaseline for the benchmark environments, e.g., Starcraft Multi-Agent Challenge\n(SMAC), Difficulty-Enhanced Predator-Prey (DEPP). Recent variants of QMIX\ntarget relaxing the monotonicity constraint of QMIX, allowing for performance\nimprovement in SMAC. In this paper, we investigate the code-level optimizations\nof these variants and the monotonicity constraint.

(2) The experiment results show that QMIX with normalized\noptimizations outperforms other works in SMAC; (3) beyond the common wisdom\nfrom these works, the monotonicity constraint can improve sample efficiency in\nSMAC and DEPP.

Algebraic multigrid (AMG) methods are one of the most common methods\nof solving such linear systems, with an extensive body of underlying\nmathematical theory. A system of linear equations defines a graph on the set of\nunknowns and each level of a multigrid solver requires the selection of an\nappropriate coarse graph along with restriction and interpolation operators\nthat map to and from the coarse representation. The efficiency of the multigrid\nsolver depends critically on this selection and many selection methods have\nbeen developed over the years. Recently, it has been demonstrated that it is\npossible to directly learn the AMG interpolation and restriction operators,\ngiven a coarse graph selection. In this paper, we consider the complementary\nproblem of learning to coarsen graphs for a multigrid solver, a necessary step\nin developing fully learnable AMG methods. We propose a method using a\nreinforcement learning (RL) agent based on graph neural networks (GNNs), which\ncan learn to perform graph coarsening on small planar training graphs and then\nbe applied to unstructured large planar graphs, assuming bounded node degree.\nWe demonstrate that this method can produce better coarse graphs than existing\nalgorithms, even as the graph size increases and other properties of the graph\nare varied.

This ability is thought to be\nfacilitated by offline states like sleep where previous experiences are\nsystemically replayed. However, the characteristic creative nature of dreams\nsuggests that learning semantic representations may go beyond merely replaying\nprevious experiences. We support this hypothesis by implementing a cortical\narchitecture inspired by generative adversarial networks (GANs).

We train the model on standard datasets of natural images\nand evaluate the quality of the learned representations. Our results suggest\nthat generating new, virtual sensory inputs via adversarial dreaming during REM\nsleep is essential for extracting semantic concepts, while replaying episodic\nmemories via perturbed dreaming during NREM sleep improves the robustness of\nlatent representations.

Therefore, this\nstudy presents a new approach using different machine learning and deep\nlearning algorithms applied to Brazilian COVID-19 data. First, a clustering\nalgorithm is used to identify counties with similar sociodemographic behavior,\nwhile Benford's law is used to check for data manipulation. Based on these\nresults we are able to correctly model SARIMA models based on the clusters to\npredict new daily cases. The unsupervised machine learning techniques optimized\nthe process of defining the parameters of the SARIMA model. This framework can\nalso be useful to propose confinement scenarios during the so-called second\nwave. We have used the 645 counties from S\\~ao Paulo state, the most populous\nstate in Brazil. However, this methodology can be used in other states or\ncountries. This paper demonstrates how different techniques of machine\nlearning, deep learning, data mining and statistics can be used together to\nproduce important results when dealing with pandemic data.

          "description": "The actor-critic RL is widely used in various robotic control tasks. By\nviewing the actor-critic RL from the perspective of variational inference (VI),\nthe policy network is trained to obtain the approximate posterior of actions\ngiven the optimality criteria. However, in practice, the actor-critic RL may\nyield suboptimal policy estimates due to the amortization gap and insufficient\nexploration. In this work, inspired by the previous use of Hamiltonian Monte\nCarlo (HMC) in VI, we propose to integrate the policy network of actor-critic\nRL with HMC, which is termed as {\\it Hamiltonian Policy}. As such we propose to\nevolve actions from the base policy according to HMC, and our proposed method\nhas many benefits. First, HMC can improve the policy distribution to better\napproximate the posterior and hence reduce the amortization gap. Second, HMC\ncan also guide the exploration more to the regions of action spaces with higher\nQ values, enhancing the exploration efficiency. Further, instead of directly\napplying HMC into RL, we propose a new leapfrog operator to simulate the\nHamiltonian dynamics. Finally, in safe RL problems, we find that the proposed\nmethod can not only improve the achieved return, but also reduce safety\nconstraint violations by discarding potentially unsafe actions. With\ncomprehensive empirical experiments on continuous control baselines, including\nMuJoCo and PyBullet Roboschool, we show that the proposed approach is a\ndata-efficient and easy-to-implement improvement over previous actor-critic\nmethods.",

          "description": "Running machine learning algorithms on large and rapidly growing volumes of\ndata is often computationally expensive, one common trick to reduce the size of\na data set, and thus reduce the computational cost of machine learning\nalgorithms, is \\emph{probability sampling}. It creates a sampled data set by\nincluding each data point from the original data set with a known probability.\nAlthough the benefit of running machine learning algorithms on the reduced data\nset is obvious, one major concern is that the performance of the solution\nobtained from samples might be much worse than that of the optimal solution\nwhen using the full data set. In this paper, we examine the performance loss\ncaused by probability sampling in the context of adaptive submodular\nmaximization. We consider a simple probability sampling method which selects\neach data point with probability $r\\in[0,1]$. If we set the sampling rate\n$r=1$, our problem reduces to finding a solution based on the original full\ndata set. We define sampling gap as the largest ratio between the optimal\nsolution obtained from the full data set and the optimal solution obtained from\nthe samples, over independence systems. %It captures the performance loss of\nthe optimal solution caused by the probability sampling. Our main contribution\nis to show that if the utility function is policywise submodular, then for a\ngiven sampling rate $r$, the sampling gap is both upper bounded and lower\nbounded by $1/r$. One immediate implication of our result is that if we can\nfind an $\\alpha$-approximation solution based on a sampled data set (which is\nsampled at sampling rate $r$), then this solution achieves an $\\alpha r$\napproximation ratio against the optimal solution when using the full data set.",

          "description": "FPGA-specific DNN architectures using the native LUTs as independently\ntrainable inference operators have been shown to achieve favorable\narea-accuracy and energy-accuracy tradeoffs. The first work in this area,\nLUTNet, exhibited state-of-the-art performance for standard DNN benchmarks. In\nthis paper, we propose the learned optimization of such LUT-based topologies,\nresulting in higher-efficiency designs than via the direct use of\noff-the-shelf, hand-designed networks. Existing implementations of this class\nof architecture require the manual specification of the number of inputs per\nLUT, K. Choosing appropriate K a priori is challenging, and doing so at even\nhigh granularity, e.g. per layer, is a time-consuming and error-prone process\nthat leaves FPGAs' spatial flexibility underexploited. Furthermore, prior works\nsee LUT inputs connected randomly, which does not guarantee a good choice of\nnetwork topology. To address these issues, we propose logic shrinkage, a\nfine-grained netlist pruning methodology enabling K to be automatically learned\nfor every LUT in a neural network targeted for FPGA inference. By removing LUT\ninputs determined to be of low importance, our method increases the efficiency\nof the resultant accelerators. Our GPU-friendly solution to LUT input removal\nis capable of processing large topologies during their training with negligible\nslowdown. With logic shrinkage, we better the area and energy efficiency of the\nbest-performing LUTNet implementation of the CNV network classifying CIFAR-10\nby 1.54x and 1.31x, respectively, while matching its accuracy. This\nimplementation also reaches 2.71x the area efficiency of an equally accurate,\nheavily pruned BNN. On ImageNet with the Bi-Real Net architecture, employment\nof logic shrinkage results in a post-synthesis area reduction of 2.67x vs\nLUTNet, allowing for implementation that was previously impossible on today's\nlargest FPGAs.",

In this paper, we propose a\nconditional SI method for popular robust regressions by using homotopy method.\nWe show that the proposed conditional SI method is applicable to a wide class\nof robust regression and outlier detection methods and has good empirical\nperformance on both synthetic data and real data experiments.",

This success can be partly\nattributed to the advancements made in the sub-fields of AI such as machine\nlearning, computer vision, and natural language processing. Much of the growth\nin these fields has been made possible with deep learning, a sub-area of\nmachine learning that uses artificial neural networks. This has created\nsignificant interest in the integration of vision and language. In this survey,\nwe focus on ten prominent tasks that integrate language and vision by\ndiscussing their problem formulation, methods, existing datasets, evaluation\nmeasures, and compare the results obtained with corresponding state-of-the-art\nmethods. Our efforts go beyond earlier surveys which are either task-specific\nor concentrate only on one type of visual content, i.e., image or video.\nFurthermore, we also provide some potential future directions in this field of\nresearch with an anticipation that this survey stimulates innovative thoughts\nand ideas to address the existing challenges and build new applications.",

We show the application of BlosSOM on realistic datasets, where it\nhelps to produce high-quality visualizations that incorporate user-specified\nlayout and focus on certain features.

          "description": "Hybrid analog and digital beamforming transceivers are instrumental in\naddressing the challenge of expensive hardware and high training overheads in\nthe next generation millimeter-wave (mm-Wave) massive MIMO (multiple-input\nmultiple-output) systems. However, lack of fully digital beamforming in hybrid\narchitectures and short coherence times at mm-Wave impose additional\nconstraints on the channel estimation. Prior works on addressing these\nchallenges have focused largely on narrowband channels wherein\noptimization-based or greedy algorithms were employed to derive hybrid\nbeamformers. In this paper, we introduce a deep learning (DL) approach for\nchannel estimation and hybrid beamforming for frequency-selective, wideband\nmm-Wave systems. In particular, we consider a massive MIMO Orthogonal Frequency\nDivision Multiplexing (MIMO-OFDM) system and propose three different DL\nframeworks comprising convolutional neural networks (CNNs), which accept the\nraw data of received signal as input and yield channel estimates and the hybrid\nbeamformers at the output. We also introduce both offline and online prediction\nschemes. Numerical experiments demonstrate that, compared to the current\nstate-of-the-art optimization and DL methods, our approach provides higher\nspectral efficiency, lesser computational cost and fewer number of pilot\nsignals, and higher tolerance against the deviations in the received pilot\ndata, corrupted channel matrix, and propagation environment.",

          "description": "We study the random reshuffling (RR) method for smooth nonconvex optimization\nproblems with a finite-sum structure. Though this method is widely utilized in\npractice such as the training of neural networks, its convergence behavior is\nonly understood in several limited settings. In this paper, under the\nwell-known Kurdyka-Lojasiewicz (KL) inequality, we establish strong limit-point\nconvergence results for RR with appropriate diminishing step sizes, namely, the\nwhole sequence of iterates generated by RR is convergent and converges to a\nsingle stationary point in an almost sure sense. In addition, we derive the\ncorresponding rate of convergence, depending on the KL exponent and the\nsuitably selected diminishing step sizes. When the KL exponent lies in\n$[0,\\frac12]$, the convergence is at a rate of $\\mathcal{O}(t^{-1})$ with $t$\ncounting the iteration number. When the KL exponent belongs to $(\\frac12,1)$,\nour derived convergence rate is of the form $\\mathcal{O}(t^{-q})$ with $q\\in\n(0,1)$ depending on the KL exponent. The standard KL inequality-based\nconvergence analysis framework only applies to algorithms with a certain\ndescent property. We conduct a novel convergence analysis for the non-descent\nRR method with diminishing step sizes based on the KL inequality, which\ngeneralizes the standard KL framework. We summarize our main steps and core\nideas in an informal analysis framework, which is of independent interest. As a\ndirect application of this framework, we also establish similar strong\nlimit-point convergence results for the reshuffled proximal point method.",

A fundamental problem in contrastive learning is mitigating the\neffects of false negatives. Contrasting false negatives induces two critical\nissues in representation learning: discarding semantic information and slow\nconvergence. In this paper, we propose novel approaches to identify false\nnegatives, as well as two strategies to mitigate their effect, i.e. false\nnegative elimination and attraction, while systematically performing rigorous\nevaluations to study this problem in detail. Our method exhibits consistent\nimprovements over existing contrastive learning-based methods.

Despite rigorous theoretical\nguarantees, the model so far can only achieve comparable performance to\nconventional networks. In this paper, we make the following two contributions:\n$\\mathrm{(i)}$ We demonstrate that $\\ell_\\infty$-distance nets enjoy a\nfundamental advantage in certified robustness over conventional networks (under\ntypical certification approaches); $\\mathrm{(ii)}$ With an improved training\nprocess we are able to significantly boost the certified accuracy of\n$\\ell_\\infty$-distance nets. Our training approach largely alleviates the\noptimization problem that arose in the previous training scheme, in particular,\nthe unexpected large Lipschitz constant due to the use of a crucial trick\ncalled $\\ell_p$-relaxation. The core of our training approach is a novel\nobjective function that combines scaled cross-entropy loss and clipped hinge\nloss with a decaying mixing coefficient. Experiments show that using the\nproposed training strategy, the certified accuracy of $\\ell_\\infty$-distance\nnet can be dramatically improved from 33.30% to 40.06% on CIFAR-10\n($\\epsilon=8/255$), meanwhile outperforming other approaches in this area by a\nlarge margin.

          "description": "Data augmentation is a simple yet effective way to improve the robustness of\ndeep neural networks (DNNs). Diversity and hardness are two complementary\ndimensions of data augmentation to achieve robustness. For example, AugMix\nexplores random compositions of a diverse set of augmentations to enhance\nbroader coverage, while adversarial training generates adversarially hard\nsamples to spot the weakness. Motivated by this, we propose a data augmentation\nframework, termed AugMax, to unify the two aspects of diversity and hardness.\nAugMax first randomly samples multiple augmentation operators and then learns\nan adversarial mixture of the selected operators. Being a stronger form of data\naugmentation, AugMax leads to a significantly augmented input distribution\nwhich makes model training more challenging.

          "description": "Resting-state fMRI is commonly used for diagnosing Autism Spectrum Disorder\n(ASD) by using network-based functional connectivity. It has been shown that\nASD is associated with brain regions and their inter-connections. However,\ndiscriminating based on connectivity patterns among imaging data of the control\npopulation and that of ASD patients' brains is a non-trivial task. In order to\ntackle said classification task, we propose a novel deep learning architecture\n(MHATC) consisting of multi-head attention and temporal consolidation modules\nfor classifying an individual as a patient of ASD. The devised architecture\nresults from an in-depth analysis of the limitations of current deep neural\nnetwork solutions for similar applications. Our approach is not only robust but\ncomputationally efficient, which can allow its adoption in a variety of other\nresearch and clinical settings.",

          "description": "Inferring reward functions from demonstrations and pairwise preferences are\nauspicious approaches for aligning Reinforcement Learning (RL) agents with\nhuman intentions. However, state-of-the art methods typically focus on learning\na single reward model, thus rendering it difficult to trade off different\nreward functions from multiple experts. We propose Multi-Objective Reinforced\nActive Learning (MORAL), a novel method for combining diverse demonstrations of\nsocial norms into a Pareto-optimal policy. Through maintaining a distribution\nover scalarization weights, our approach is able to interactively tune a deep\nRL agent towards a variety of preferences, while eliminating the need for\ncomputing multiple policies. We empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of\nMORAL in two scenarios, which model a delivery and an emergency task that\nrequire an agent to act in the presence of normative conflicts. Overall, we\nconsider our research a step towards multi-objective RL with learned rewards,\nbridging the gap between current reward learning and machine ethics literature.",

While there\nhave been many developments in the area of object tracking in recent years,\ntracking a small moving object amid other moving objects and actors (such as a\nball amid moving players in sports footage) continues to be a difficult task.\nExisting spatio-temporal networks, such as convolutional Gated Recurrent Units\n(convGRUs), are difficult to train and have trouble accurately tracking small\nobjects under such conditions. To overcome these difficulties, we developed the\nmaskGRU framework that uses a weighted sum of the internal hidden state\nproduced by a convGRU and a 3-channel mask of the tracked object's predicted\nbounding box as the hidden state to be used at the next time step of the\nunderlying convGRU. We believe the technique of incorporating a mask into the\nhidden state through a weighted sum has two benefits: controlling the effect of\nexploding gradients and introducing an attention-like mechanism into the\nnetwork by indicating where in the previous video frame the object is located.\nOur experiments show that maskGRU outperforms convGRU at tracking objects that\nare small relative to the video resolution even in the presence of other moving\nobjects.",

          "description": "We propose an approach to modeling irregularly spaced sequences of discrete\nevents. We begin with a continuous-time variant of the Transformer, which was\noriginally formulated (Vaswani et al., 2017) for sequences without timestamps.\nWe embed a possible event (or other boolean fact) at time $t$ by using\nattention over the events that occurred at times $< t$ (and the facts that were\ntrue when they occurred). We control this attention using pattern-matching\nlogic rules that relate events and facts that share participants. These rules\ndetermine which previous events will be attended to, as well as how to\ntransform the embeddings of the events and facts into the attentional queries,\nkeys, and values. Other logic rules describe how to change the set of facts in\nresponse to events. Our approach closely follows Mei et al. (2020a), and adopts\ntheir Datalog Through Time formalism for logic rules. As in that work, a domain\nexpert first writes a set of logic rules that establishes the set of possible\nevents and other facts at each time $t$. Each possible event or other fact is\nembedded using a neural architecture that is derived from the rules that\nestablished it. Our only difference from Mei et al. (2020a) is that we derive a\nflatter, attention-based neural architecture whereas they used a more serial\nLSTM architecture. We find that our attention-based approach performs about\nequally well on the RoboCup dataset, where the logic rules play an important\nrole in improving performance. We also compared these two methods with two\nprevious attention-based methods (Zuo et al., 2020; Zhang et al., 2020a) on\nsimpler synthetic and real domains without logic rules, and found our proposed\napproach to be at least as good, and sometimes better, than each of the other\nthree methods.",

The\nensemble weighting model uses both LSTM features and statistical features to\ncombine the models accurately. Analysis of feature importance and interaction\nshow a slight superiority for LSTM features over the statistical ones alone.\nClustering analysis shows that different essential LSTM features are different\nfrom most statistical features and each other.

          "description": "It is increasingly acknowledged that a priori statistical power estimation\nfor planned studies with multiple model parameters is inherently a multivariate\nproblem. Power for individual parameters of interest cannot be reliably\nestimated univariately because sampling variably in, correlation with, and\nvariance explained relative to one parameter will impact the power for another\nparameter, all usual univariate considerations being equal. Explicit solutions\nin such cases, especially for models with many parameters, are either\nimpractical or impossible to solve, leaving researchers with the prevailing\nmethod of simulating power. However, point estimates for a vector of model\nparameters are uncertain, and the impact of inaccuracy is unknown. In such\ncases, sensitivity analysis is recommended such that multiple combinations of\npossible observable parameter vectors are simulated to understand power\ntrade-offs. A limitation to this approach is that it is computationally\nexpensive to generate sufficient sensitivity combinations to accurately map the\npower trade-off function in increasingly high dimensional spaces for the models\nthat social scientists estimate. This paper explores the efficient estimation\nand graphing of statistical power for a study over varying model parameter\ncombinations. Optimally powering a study is crucial to ensure a minimum\nprobability of finding the hypothesized effect. We first demonstrate the impact\nof varying parameter values on power for specific hypotheses of interest and\nquantify the computational intensity of computing such a graph for a given\nlevel of precision. Finally, we propose a simple and generalizable machine\nlearning inspired solution to cut the computational cost to less than 7\\% of\nwhat could be called a brute force approach. [abridged]",

The goal of the Lung-Originated Tumor\nSegmentation from Computed Tomography Scan (LOTUS) Benchmark created through\n2018 IEEE Video and Image Processing (VIP) Cup competition, is to provide a\nunique dataset and pre-defined metrics, so that different researchers can\ndevelop and evaluate their methods in a unified fashion. The 2018 VIP Cup\nstarted with a global engagement from 42 countries to access the competition\ndata. At the registration stage, there were 129 members clustered into 28 teams\nfrom 10 countries, out of which 9 teams made it to the final stage and 6 teams\nsuccessfully completed all the required tasks. In a nutshell, all the\nalgorithms proposed during the competition, are based on deep learning models\ncombined with a false positive reduction technique. Methods developed by the\nthree finalists show promising results in tumor segmentation, however, more\neffort should be put into reducing the false positive rate. This competition\nmanuscript presents an overview of the VIP-Cup challenge, along with the\nproposed algorithms and results.",

          "description": "This paper is concerned with the training of neural networks (NNs) under\nsemidefinite constraints. This type of training problems has recently gained\npopularity since semidefinite constraints can be used to verify interesting\nproperties for NNs that include, e.g., the estimation of an upper bound on the\nLipschitz constant, which relates to the robustness of an NN, or the stability\nof dynamic systems with NN controllers. The utilized semidefinite constraints\nare based on sector constraints satisfied by the underlying activation\nfunctions. Unfortunately, one of the biggest bottlenecks of these new results\nis the required computational effort for incorporating the semidefinite\nconstraints into the training of NNs which is limiting their scalability to\nlarge NNs. We address this challenge by developing interior point methods for\nNN training that we implement using barrier functions for semidefinite\nconstraints. In order to efficiently compute the gradients of the barrier\nterms, we exploit the structure of the semidefinite constraints. In\nexperiments, we demonstrate the superior efficiency of our training method over\nprevious approaches, which allows us, e.g., to use semidefinite constraints in\nthe training of Wasserstein generative adversarial networks, where the\ndiscriminator must satisfy a Lipschitz condition.",

          "description": "Recently, deep reinforcement learning (RL) has proven its feasibility in\nsolving combinatorial optimization problems (COPs). The learning-to-rank\ntechniques have been studied in the field of information retrieval. While\nseveral COPs can be formulated as the prioritization of input items, as is\ncommon in the information retrieval, it has not been fully explored how the\nlearning-to-rank techniques can be incorporated into deep RL for COPs. In this\npaper, we present the learning-to-rank distillation-based COP framework, where\na high-performance ranking policy obtained by RL for a COP can be distilled\ninto a non-iterative, simple model, thereby achieving a low-latency COP solver.\nSpecifically, we employ the approximated ranking distillation to render a\nscore-based ranking model learnable via gradient descent. Furthermore, we use\nthe efficient sequence sampling to improve the inference performance with a\nlimited delay. With the framework, we demonstrate that a distilled model not\nonly achieves comparable performance to its respective, high-performance RL,\nbut also provides several times faster inferences. We evaluate the framework\nwith several COPs such as priority-based task scheduling and multidimensional\nknapsack, demonstrating the benefits of the framework in terms of inference\nlatency and performance.",

In this paper, we specifically consider the problems of\ndomain shifts and subpopulation shifts (eg. imbalanced data). While prior works\noften seek to explicitly regularize internal representations and predictors of\nthe model to be domain invariant, we instead aim to regularize the whole\nfunction without restricting the model's internal representations. This leads\nto a simple mixup-based technique which learns invariant functions via\nselective augmentation called LISA. LISA selectively interpolates samples\neither with the same labels but different domains or with the same domain but\ndifferent labels. We analyze a linear setting and theoretically show how LISA\nleads to a smaller worst-group error.

          "description": "Large-scale or high-resolution geologic models usually comprise a huge number\nof grid blocks, which can be computationally demanding and time-consuming to\nsolve with numerical simulators. Therefore, it is advantageous to upscale\ngeologic models (e.g., hydraulic conductivity) from fine-scale (high-resolution\ngrids) to coarse-scale systems. Numerical upscaling methods have been proven to\nbe effective and robust for coarsening geologic models, but their efficiency\nremains to be improved. In this work, a deep-learning-based method is proposed\nto upscale the fine-scale geologic models, which can assist to improve\nupscaling efficiency significantly. In the deep learning method, a deep\nconvolutional neural network (CNN) is trained to approximate the relationship\nbetween the coarse grid of hydraulic conductivity fields and the hydraulic\nheads, which can then be utilized to replace the numerical solvers while\nsolving the flow equations for each coarse block. In addition, physical laws\n(e.g., governing equations and periodic boundary conditions) can also be\nincorporated into the training process of the deep CNN model, which is termed\nthe theory-guided convolutional neural network (TgCNN). With the physical\ninformation considered, dependence on the data volume of training the deep\nlearning models can be reduced greatly. Several subsurface flow cases are\nintroduced to test the performance of the proposed deep-learning-based\nupscaling method, including 2D and 3D cases, and isotropic and anisotropic\ncases. The results show that the deep learning method can provide equivalent\nupscaling accuracy to the numerical method, and efficiency can be improved\nsignificantly compared to numerical upscaling.",

Our second contribution focusses\non 1-D UOT and proposes a Frank-Wolfe solver applied to this translation\ninvariant formulation. The linear oracle of each steps amounts to solving a 1-D\nOT problems, resulting in a linear time complexity per iteration.

          "description": "We outline the general framework of machine learning (ML) methods for\nmulti-scale dynamical modeling of condensed matter systems, and in particular\nof strongly correlated electron models. Complex spatial temporal behaviors in\nthese systems often arise from the interplay between quasi-particles and the\nemergent dynamical classical degrees of freedom, such as local lattice\ndistortions, spins, and order-parameters. Central to the proposed framework is\nthe ML energy model that, by successfully emulating the time-consuming\nelectronic structure calculation, can accurately predict a local energy based\non the classical field in the intermediate neighborhood. In order to properly\ninclude the symmetry of the electron Hamiltonian, a crucial component of the ML\nenergy model is the descriptor that transforms the neighborhood configuration\ninto invariant feature variables, which are input to the learning model. A\ngeneral theory of the descriptor for the classical fields is formulated, and\ntwo types of models are distinguished depending on the presence or absence of\nan internal symmetry for the classical field. Several specific approaches to\nthe descriptor of the classical fields are presented. Our focus is on the\ngroup-theoretical method that offers a systematic and rigorous approach to\ncompute invariants based on the bispectrum coefficients. We propose an\nefficient implementation of the bispectrum method based on the concept of\nreference irreducible representations. Finally, the implementations of the\nvarious descriptors are demonstrated on well-known electronic lattice models.",

In particular, analyzing the games since the\nintroduction of the algorithm in 2018, we conclude that the game's \"importance\"\n(as defined by FIFA) used in the algorithm is counterproductive from the point\nof view of the predictive capability of the algorithm. We also postulate the\nalgorithm to be rooted in the formal modelling principle, where the Davidson\nmodel proposed in 1970 seems to be an excellent candidate, preserving the form\nof the algorithm currently used. The results indicate that the predictive\ncapability of the algorithm is notably improved by using the home-field\nadvantage and the explicit model for the draws in the game. Moderate, but\nnotable improvement may be attained by introducing the weighting of the results\nwith the goal differential, which although not rooted in a formal modelling\nprinciple, is compatible with the current algorithm and can be tuned to the\ncharacteristics of the football competition.",

          "description": "Multiple medical institutions collaboratively training a model using\nfederated learning (FL) has become a promising solution for maximizing the\npotential of data-driven models, yet the non-independent and identically\ndistributed (non-iid) data in medical images is still an outstanding challenge\nin real-world practice. The feature heterogeneity caused by diverse scanners or\nprotocols introduces a drift in the learning process, in both local (client)\nand global (server) optimizations, which harms the convergence as well as model\nperformance. Many previous works have attempted to address the non-iid issue by\ntackling the drift locally or globally, but how to jointly solve the two\nessentially coupled drifts is still unclear. In this work, we concentrate on\nhandling both local and global drifts and introduce a new harmonizing framework\ncalled HarmoFL. First, we propose to mitigate the local update drift by\nnormalizing amplitudes of images transformed into the frequency domain to mimic\na unified imaging setting, in order to generate a harmonized feature space\nacross local clients. Second, based on harmonized features, we design a client\nweight perturbation guiding each local model to reach a flat optimum, where a\nneighborhood area of the local optimal solution has a uniformly low loss.\nWithout any extra communication cost, the perturbation assists the global model\nto optimize towards a converged optimal solution by aggregating several local\nflat optima. We have theoretically analyzed the proposed method and empirically\nconducted extensive experiments on three medical image classification and\nsegmentation tasks, showing that HarmoFL outperforms a set of recent\nstate-of-the-art methods with promising convergence behavior.

          "description": "Deploying various deep learning (DL) models efficiently has boosted the\nresearch on DL compilers. The difficulty of generating optimized tensor codes\ndrives DL compiler to ask for the auto-tuning approaches, and the increasing\ndemands require increasing auto-tuning efficiency and quality. Currently, the\nDL compilers partition the input DL models into several subgraphs and leverage\nthe auto-tuning to find the optimal tensor codes of these subgraphs. However,\nexisting auto-tuning approaches usually regard subgraphs as individual ones and\noverlook the similarities across them, and thus fail to exploit better tensor\ncodes under limited time budgets. We propose FamilySeer, an auto-tuning\nframework for DL compilers that can generate better tensor codes even with\nlimited time budgets. FamilySeer exploits the similarities and differences\namong subgraphs can organize them into subgraph families, where the tuning of\none subgraph can also improve other subgraphs within the same family. The cost\nmodel of each family gets more purified training samples generated by the\nfamily and becomes more accurate so that the costly measurements on real\nhardware can be replaced with the lightweight estimation through cost model.\nOur experiments show that FamilySeer can generate model codes with the same\ncode performance more efficiently than state-of-the-art auto-tuning frameworks.",

          "description": "Reinforcement learning agents learn by encouraging behaviours which maximize\ntheir total reward, usually provided by the environment. In many environments,\nhowever, the reward is provided after a series of actions rather than each\nsingle action, leading the agent to experience ambiguity in terms of whether\nthose actions are effective, an issue known as the credit assignment problem.\nIn this paper, we propose two strategies inspired by behavioural psychology to\nenable the agent to intrinsically estimate more informative reward values for\nactions with no reward. The first strategy, called self-punishment (SP),\ndiscourages the agent from making mistakes that lead to undesirable terminal\nstates. The second strategy, called the rewards backfill (RB), backpropagates\nthe rewards between two rewarded actions. We prove that, under certain\nassumptions and regardless of the reinforcement learning algorithm used, these\ntwo strategies maintain the order of policies in the space of all possible\npolicies in terms of their total reward, and, by extension, maintain the\noptimal policy. Hence, our proposed strategies integrate with any reinforcement\nlearning algorithm that learns a value or action-value function through\nexperience. We incorporated these two strategies into three popular deep\nreinforcement learning approaches and evaluated the results on thirty Atari\ngames. After parameter tuning, our results indicate that the proposed\nstrategies improve the tested methods in over 65 percent of tested games by up\nto over 25 times performance improvement.",

          "description": "Spectral embedding of network adjacency matrices often produces node\nrepresentations living approximately around low-dimensional submanifold\nstructures. In particular, hidden substructure is expected to arise when the\ngraph is generated from a latent position model. Furthermore, the presence of\ncommunities within the network might generate community-specific submanifold\nstructures in the embedding, but this is not explicitly accounted for in most\nstatistical models for networks. In this article, a class of models called\nlatent structure block models (LSBM) is proposed to address such scenarios,\nallowing for graph clustering when community-specific one dimensional manifold\nstructure is present. LSBMs focus on a specific class of latent space model,\nthe random dot product graph (RDPG), and assign a latent submanifold to the\nlatent positions of each community. A Bayesian model for the embeddings arising\nfrom LSBMs is discussed, and shown to have a good performance on simulated and\nreal world network data. The model is able to correctly recover the underlying\ncommunities living in a one-dimensional manifold, even when the parametric form\nof the underlying curves is unknown, achieving remarkable results on a variety\nof real data.",

Using a Prototypical Network trained with evolution\nstrategies on the Omniglot dataset, we achieved an accuracy of 98.4% on a\n5-shot classification problem. Our algorithm used as much as 40 times less\nmemory than automatic differentiation to compute the gradient, with the\nresulting model achieving accuracy within 1.3% of a backpropagation-trained\nequivalent (99.6%). We observed better classification accuracy as high as 99.1%\nwith larger population configurations. We further experimentally validate the\nstability and performance of ES-ProtoNet across a variety of training\nconditions (varying population size, model size, number of workers, shot, way,\nES hyperparameters, etc.).

          "description": "Contrastive learning has been widely applied to graph representation\nlearning, where the view generators play a vital role in generating effective\ncontrastive samples. Most of the existing contrastive learning methods employ\npre-defined view generation methods, e.g., node drop or edge perturbation,\nwhich usually cannot adapt to input data or preserve the original semantic\nstructures well. To address this issue, we propose a novel framework named\nAutomated Graph Contrastive Learning (AutoGCL) in this paper. Specifically,\nAutoGCL employs a set of learnable graph view generators orchestrated by an\nauto augmentation strategy, where every graph view generator learns a\nprobability distribution of graphs conditioned by the input. While the graph\nview generators in AutoGCL preserve the most representative structures of the\noriginal graph in generation of every contrastive sample, the auto augmentation\nlearns policies to introduce adequate augmentation variances in the whole\ncontrastive learning procedure. Furthermore, AutoGCL adopts a joint training\nstrategy to train the learnable view generators, the graph encoder, and the\nclassifier in an end-to-end manner, resulting in topological heterogeneity yet\nsemantic similarity in the generation of contrastive samples. Extensive\nexperiments on semi-supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and transfer\nlearning demonstrate the superiority of our AutoGCL framework over the\nstate-of-the-arts in graph contrastive learning. In addition, the visualization\nresults further confirm that the learnable view generators can deliver more\ncompact and semantically meaningful contrastive samples compared against the\nexisting view generation methods.",

          "description": "Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is a notoriously noisy\nmeasurement of brain activity because of the large variations between\nindividuals, signals marred by environmental differences during collection, and\nspatiotemporal averaging required by the measurement resolution. In addition,\nthe data is extremely high dimensional, with the space of the activity\ntypically having much lower intrinsic dimension. In order to understand the\nconnection between stimuli of interest and brain activity, and analyze\ndifferences and commonalities between subjects, it becomes important to learn a\nmeaningful embedding of the data that denoises, and reveals its intrinsic\nstructure. Specifically, we assume that while noise varies significantly\nbetween individuals, true responses to stimuli will share common,\nlow-dimensional features between subjects which are jointly discoverable.\nSimilar approaches have been exploited previously but they have mainly used\nlinear methods such as PCA and shared response modeling (SRM). In contrast, we\npropose a neural network called MRMD-AE (manifold-regularized multiple decoder,\nautoencoder), that learns a common embedding from multiple subjects in an\nexperiment while retaining the ability to decode to individual raw fMRI\nsignals. We show that our learned common space represents an extensible\nmanifold (where new points not seen during training can be mapped), improves\nthe classification accuracy of stimulus features of unseen timepoints, as well\nas improves cross-subject translation of fMRI signals. We believe this\nframework can be used for many downstream applications such as guided\nbrain-computer interface (BCI) training in the future.",

          "description": "Many past attempts at modeling repeated Cournot games assume that demand is\nstationary. This does not align with real-world scenarios in which market\ndemands can evolve over a product's lifetime for a myriad of reasons. In this\npaper, we model repeated Cournot games with non-stationary demand such that\nfirms/agents face separate instances of non-stationary multi-armed bandit\nproblem. The set of arms/actions that an agent can choose from represents\ndiscrete production quantities; here, the action space is ordered. Agents are\nindependent and autonomous, and cannot observe anything from the environment;\nthey can only see their own rewards after taking an action, and only work\ntowards maximizing these rewards. We propose a novel algorithm 'Adaptive with\nWeighted Exploration (AWE) $\\epsilon$-greedy' which is remotely based on the\nwell-known $\\epsilon$-greedy approach. This algorithm detects and quantifies\nchanges in rewards due to varying market demand and varies learning rate and\nexploration rate in proportion to the degree of changes in demand, thus\nenabling agents to better identify new optimal actions. For efficient\nexploration, it also deploys a mechanism for weighing actions that takes\nadvantage of the ordered action space. We use simulations to study the\nemergence of various equilibria in the market. In addition, we study the\nscalability of our approach in terms number of total agents in the system and\nthe size of action space. We consider both symmetric and asymmetric firms in\nour models. We found that using our proposed method, agents are able to swiftly\nchange their course of action according to the changes in demand, and they also\nengage in collusive behavior in many simulations.",

          "description": "As machine learning powered decision making is playing an increasingly\nimportant role in our daily lives, it is imperative to strive for fairness of\nthe underlying data processing and algorithms. We propose a pre-processing\nalgorithm for fair data representation via which L2- objective supervised\nlearning algorithms result in an estimation of the Pareto frontier between\nprediction error and statistical disparity. In particular, the present work\napplies the optimal positive definite affine transport maps to approach the\npost-processing Wasserstein barycenter characterization of the optimal fair\nL2-objective supervised learning via a pre-processing data deformation. We call\nthe resulting data Wasserstein pseudo-barycenter. Furthermore, we show that the\nWasserstein geodesics from the learning outcome marginals to the barycenter\ncharacterizes the Pareto frontier between L2-loss and total Wasserstein\ndistance among learning outcome marginals. Thereby, an application of McCann\ninterpolation generalizes the pseudo-barycenter to a family of data\nrepresentations via which L2-objective supervised learning algorithms result in\nthe Pareto frontier. Numerical simulations underscore the advantages of the\nproposed data representation: (1) the pre-processing step is compositive with\narbitrary L2-objective supervised learning methods and unseen data; (2) the\nfair representation protects data privacy by preventing the training machine\nfrom direct or indirect access to the sensitive information of the data; (3)\nthe optimal affine map results in efficient computation of fair supervised\nlearning on high-dimensional data; (4) experimental results shed light on the\nfairness of L2-objective unsupervised learning via the proposed fair data\nrepresentation.",

          "description": "The advent of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) has led to their\napplication in several domains. One noteworthy application is the perception\nsystem for autonomous driving that relies on the predictions from CNNs.\nPractitioners evaluate the generalization ability of such CNNs by calculating\nvarious metrics on an independent test dataset. A test dataset is often chosen\nbased on only one precondition, i.e., its elements are not a part of the\ntraining data. Such a dataset may contain objects that are both similar and\nnovel w.r.t. the training dataset. Nevertheless, existing works do not reckon\nthe novelty of the test samples and treat them all equally for evaluating\ngeneralization. Such novelty-based evaluations are of significance to validate\nthe fitness of a CNN in autonomous driving applications. Hence, we propose a\nCNN generalization scoring framework that considers novelty of objects in the\ntest dataset. We begin with the representation learning technique to reduce the\nimage data into a low-dimensional space. It is on this space we estimate the\nnovelty of the test samples. Finally, we calculate the generalization score as\na combination of the test data prediction performance and novelty. We perform\nan experimental study of the same for our traffic light detection application.\nIn addition, we systematically visualize the results for an interpretable\nnotion of novelty.",

However, when adding an imperceptible magnitude\nperturbation on the model input, the model performance might get rapid\ndecrease. To address this issue, a randomness technique has been proposed\nrecently, named Stochastic Neural Networks (SNNs). Specifically, SNNs inject\nrandomness into the model to defend against unseen attacks and improve the\nadversarial robustness. However, existed studies on SNNs mainly focus on\ninjecting fixed or learnable noises to model weights/activations. In this\npaper, we find that the existed SNNs performances are largely bottlenecked by\nthe feature representation ability. Surprisingly, simply maximizing the\nvariance per dimension of the feature distribution leads to a considerable\nboost beyond all previous methods, which we named maximize feature distribution\nvariance stochastic neural network (MFDV-SNN). Extensive experiments on\nwell-known white- and black-box attacks show that MFDV-SNN achieves a\nsignificant improvement over existing methods, which indicates that it is a\nsimple but effective method to improve model robustness.",

A common insight to explain its\nsuccess is that averaging weights following an SGD process equipped with\ncyclical or high constant learning rates can discover wider optima, which then\nlead to better generalization. We give a new insight that does not concur with\nthe above one. We characterize that SWA's performance is highly dependent on to\nwhat extent the SGD process that runs before SWA converges, and the operation\nof weight averaging only contributes to variance reduction. This new insight\nsuggests practical guides on better algorithm design. As an instantiation, we\nshow that following an SGD process with insufficient convergence, running SWA\nmore times leads to continual incremental benefits in terms of generalization.\nOur findings are corroborated by extensive experiments across different network\narchitectures, including a baseline CNN, PreResNet-164, WideResNet-28-10,\nVGG16, ResNet-50, ResNet-152, DenseNet-161, and different datasets including\nCIFAR-{10,100}, and Imagenet.",

The definition of MER provides a principled way to define different\nnotions of uncertainties in Bayesian learning, including the aleatoric\nuncertainty and the minimum epistemic uncertainty. Two methods for deriving\nupper bounds for the MER are presented. The first method, generally suitable\nfor Bayesian learning with a parametric generative model, upper-bounds the MER\nby the conditional mutual information between the model parameters and the\nquantity being predicted given the observed data. It allows us to quantify the\nrate at which the MER decays to zero as more data becomes available. Under\nrealizable models, this method also relates the MER to the richness of the\ngenerative function class, notably the VC dimension in binary classification.\nThe second method, particularly suitable for Bayesian learning with a\nparametric predictive model, relates the MER to the minimum estimation error of\nthe model parameters from data. It explicitly shows how the uncertainty in\nmodel parameter estimation translates to the MER and to the final prediction\nuncertainty. We also extend the definition and analysis of MER to the setting\nwith multiple model families and the setting with nonparametric models.

ANNs require\na large amount of data to have strong out of sample performance, and many\nalgorithms for training ANN parameters are based on stochastic gradient descent\n(SGD). However, the SGD ANNs that tend to perform best on prediction tasks are\ntrained in an end to end manner that requires a large number of model\nparameters and random initialization. This means training ANNs is very time\nconsuming and the resulting models take a lot of memory to deploy. In order to\ntrain more parsimonious ANN models, we propose the use of alternative methods\nfrom the constrained optimization literature for ANN training and pretraining.\nIn particular, we propose novel mixed integer programming (MIP) formulations\nfor training fully-connected ANNs. Our formulations can account for both binary\nactivation and rectified linear unit (ReLU) activation ANNs, and for the use of\na log likelihood loss. We also develop a layer-wise greedy approach, a\ntechnique adapted for reducing the number of layers in the ANN, for model\npretraining using our MIP formulations.

          "description": "Following the popularisation of media streaming, a number of video streaming\nservices are continuously buying new video content to mine the potential profit\nfrom them. As such, the newly added content has to be handled well to be\nrecommended to suitable users. In this paper, we address the new item\ncold-start problem by exploring the potential of various deep learning features\nto provide video recommendations. The deep learning features investigated\ninclude features that capture the visual-appearance, audio and motion\ninformation from video content. We also explore different fusion methods to\nevaluate how well these feature modalities can be combined to fully exploit the\ncomplementary information captured by them. Experiments on a real-world video\ndataset for movie recommendations show that deep learning features outperform\nhand-crafted features. In particular, recommendations generated with deep\nlearning audio features and action-centric deep learning features are superior\nto MFCC and state-of-the-art iDT features. In addition, the combination of\nvarious deep learning features with hand-crafted features and textual metadata\nyields significant improvement in recommendations compared to combining only\nthe former.",

          "description": "Reinforcement learning (RL) has drawn increasing interests in recent years\ndue to its tremendous success in various applications. However, standard RL\nalgorithms can only be applied for single reward function, and cannot adapt to\nan unseen reward function quickly. In this paper, we advocate a general\noperator view of reinforcement learning, which enables us to directly\napproximate the operator that maps from reward function to value function. The\nbenefit of learning the operator is that we can incorporate any new reward\nfunction as input and attain its corresponding value function in a zero-shot\nmanner. To approximate this special type of operator, we design a number of\nnovel operator neural network architectures based on its theoretical\nproperties. Our design of operator networks outperform the existing methods and\nthe standard design of general purpose operator network, and we demonstrate the\nbenefit of our operator deep Q-learning framework in several tasks including\nreward transferring for offline policy evaluation (OPE) and reward transferring\nfor offline policy optimization in a range of tasks.",

          "description": "Vision transformers (ViT) have recently attracted considerable attentions,\nbut the huge computational cost remains an issue for practical deployment.\nPrevious ViT pruning methods tend to prune the model along one dimension\nsolely, which may suffer from excessive reduction and lead to sub-optimal model\nquality. In contrast, we advocate a multi-dimensional ViT compression paradigm,\nand propose to harness the redundancy reduction from attention head, neuron and\nsequence dimensions jointly. We firstly propose a statistical dependence based\npruning criterion that is generalizable to different dimensions for identifying\ndeleterious components. Moreover, we cast the multi-dimensional compression as\nan optimization, learning the optimal pruning policy across the three\ndimensions that maximizes the compressed model's accuracy under a computational\nbudget. The problem is solved by our adapted Gaussian process search with\nexpected improvement. Experimental results show that our method effectively\nreduces the computational cost of various ViT models.

          "description": "Detecting and labeling stance in social media text is strongly motivated by\nhate speech detection, poll prediction, engagement forecasting, and concerted\npropaganda detection. Today's best neural stance detectors need large volumes\nof training data, which is difficult to curate given the fast-changing\nlandscape of social media text and issues on which users opine. Homophily\nproperties over the social network provide strong signal of coarse-grained\nuser-level stance. But semi-supervised approaches for tweet-level stance\ndetection fail to properly leverage homophily. In light of this, We present\nSANDS, a new semi-supervised stance detector. SANDS starts from very few\nlabeled tweets. It builds multiple deep feature views of tweets. It also uses a\ndistant supervision signal from the social network to provide a surrogate loss\nsignal to the component learners. We prepare two new tweet datasets comprising\nover 236,000 politically tinted tweets from two demographics (US and India)\nposted by over 87,000 users, their follower-followee graph, and over 8,000\ntweets annotated by linguists. SANDS achieves a macro-F1 score of 0.55 (0.49)\non US (India)-based datasets, outperforming 17 baselines (including variants of\nSANDS) substantially, particularly for minority stance labels and noisy text.\nNumerous ablation experiments on SANDS disentangle the dynamics of textual and\nnetwork-propagated stance signals.",

          "description": "Unsupervised anomaly detection aims to build models to effectively detect\nunseen anomalies by only training on the normal data. Although previous\nreconstruction-based methods have made fruitful progress, their generalization\nability is limited due to two critical challenges. First, the training dataset\nonly contains normal patterns, which limits the model generalization ability.\nSecond, the feature representations learned by existing models often lack\nrepresentativeness which hampers the ability to preserve the diversity of\nnormal patterns. In this paper, we propose a novel approach called Adaptive\nMemory Network with Self-supervised Learning (AMSL) to address these challenges\nand enhance the generalization ability in unsupervised anomaly detection. Based\non the convolutional autoencoder structure, AMSL incorporates a self-supervised\nlearning module to learn general normal patterns and an adaptive memory fusion\nmodule to learn rich feature representations. Experiments on four public\nmultivariate time series datasets demonstrate that AMSL significantly improves\nthe performance compared to other state-of-the-art methods. Specifically, on\nthe largest CAP sleep stage detection dataset with 900 million samples, AMSL\noutperforms the second-best baseline by \\textbf{4}\\%+ in both accuracy and F1\nscore. Apart from the enhanced generalization ability, AMSL is also more robust\nagainst input noise.",

          "description": "Graph kernels are historically the most widely-used technique for graph\nclassification tasks. However, these methods suffer from limited performance\nbecause of the hand-crafted combinatorial features of graphs. In recent years,\ngraph neural networks (GNNs) have become the state-of-the-art method in\ndownstream graph-related tasks due to their superior performance. Most GNNs are\nbased on Message Passing Neural Network (MPNN) frameworks. However, recent\nstudies show that MPNNs can not exceed the power of the Weisfeiler-Lehman (WL)\nalgorithm in graph isomorphism test. To address the limitations of existing\ngraph kernel and GNN methods, in this paper, we propose a novel GNN framework,\ntermed \\textit{Kernel Graph Neural Networks} (KerGNNs), which integrates graph\nkernels into the message passing process of GNNs. Inspired by convolution\nfilters in convolutional neural networks (CNNs), KerGNNs adopt trainable hidden\ngraphs as graph filters which are combined with subgraphs to update node\nembeddings using graph kernels. In addition, we show that MPNNs can be viewed\nas special cases of KerGNNs. We apply KerGNNs to multiple graph-related tasks\nand use cross-validation to make fair comparisons with benchmarks. We show that\nour method achieves competitive performance compared with existing\nstate-of-the-art methods, demonstrating the potential to increase the\nrepresentation ability of GNNs. We also show that the trained graph filters in\nKerGNNs can reveal the local graph structures of the dataset, which\nsignificantly improves the model interpretability compared with conventional\nGNN models.",

          "description": "A key challenge for AI is to build embodied systems that operate in\ndynamically changing environments. Such systems must adapt to changing task\ncontexts and learn continuously. Although standard deep learning systems\nachieve state of the art results on static benchmarks, they often struggle in\ndynamic scenarios. In these settings, error signals from multiple contexts can\ninterfere with one another, ultimately leading to a phenomenon known as\ncatastrophic forgetting. In this article we investigate biologically inspired\narchitectures as solutions to these problems. Specifically, we show that the\nbiophysical properties of dendrites and local inhibitory systems enable\nnetworks to dynamically restrict and route information in a context-specific\nmanner. Our key contributions are as follows. First, we propose a novel\nartificial neural network architecture that incorporates active dendrites and\nsparse representations into the standard deep learning framework. Next, we\nstudy the performance of this architecture on two separate benchmarks requiring\ntask-based adaptation: Meta-World, a multi-task reinforcement learning\nenvironment where a robotic agent must learn to solve a variety of manipulation\ntasks simultaneously; and a continual learning benchmark in which the model's\nprediction task changes throughout training. Analysis on both benchmarks\ndemonstrates the emergence of overlapping but distinct and sparse subnetworks,\nallowing the system to fluidly learn multiple tasks with minimal forgetting.\nOur neural implementation marks the first time a single architecture has\nachieved competitive results on both multi-task and continual learning\nsettings. Our research sheds light on how biological properties of neurons can\ninform deep learning systems to address dynamic scenarios that are typically\nimpossible for traditional ANNs to solve.",

          "description": "Deep neural networks are parametrized by several thousands or millions of\nparameters, and have shown tremendous success in many classification problems.\nHowever, the large number of parameters makes it difficult to integrate these\nmodels into edge devices such as smartphones and wearable devices. To address\nthis problem, knowledge distillation (KD) has been widely employed, that uses a\npre-trained high capacity network to train a much smaller network, suitable for\nedge devices. In this paper, for the first time, we study the applicability and\nchallenges of using KD for time-series data for wearable devices. Successful\napplication of KD requires specific choices of data augmentation methods during\ntraining. However, it is not yet known if there exists a coherent strategy for\nchoosing an augmentation approach during KD. In this paper, we report the\nresults of a detailed study that compares and contrasts various common choices\nand some hybrid data augmentation strategies in KD based human activity\nanalysis. Research in this area is often limited as there are not many\ncomprehensive databases available in the public domain from wearable devices.\nOur study considers databases from small scale publicly available to one\nderived from a large scale interventional study into human activity and\nsedentary behavior. We find that the choice of data augmentation techniques\nduring KD have a variable level of impact on end performance, and find that the\noptimal network choice as well as data augmentation strategies are specific to\na dataset at hand. However, we also conclude with a general set of\nrecommendations that can provide a strong baseline performance across\ndatabases.",

          "description": "Air pollution monitoring platforms play a very important role in preventing\nand mitigating the effects of pollution. Recent advances in the field of graph\nsignal processing have made it possible to describe and analyze air pollution\nmonitoring networks using graphs. One of the main applications is the\nreconstruction of the measured signal in a graph using a subset of sensors.\nReconstructing the signal using information from sensor neighbors can help\nimprove the quality of network data, examples are filling in missing data with\ncorrelated neighboring nodes, or correcting a drifting sensor with neighboring\nsensors that are more accurate. This paper compares the use of various types of\ngraph signal reconstruction methods applied to real data sets of Spanish air\npollution reference stations. The methods considered are Laplacian\ninterpolation, graph signal processing low-pass based graph signal\nreconstruction, and kernel-based graph signal reconstruction, and are compared\non actual air pollution data sets measuring O3, NO2, and PM10. The ability of\nthe methods to reconstruct the signal of a pollutant is shown, as well as the\ncomputational cost of this reconstruction. The results indicate the superiority\nof methods based on kernel-based graph signal reconstruction, as well as the\ndifficulties of the methods to scale in an air pollution monitoring network\nwith a large number of low-cost sensors. However, we show that scalability can\nbe overcome with simple methods, such as partitioning the network using a\nclustering algorithm.",

          "description": "This paper proposes an efficient federated distillation learning system\n(EFDLS) for multi-task time series classification (TSC). EFDLS consists of a\ncentral server and multiple mobile users, where different users may run\ndifferent TSC tasks. EFDLS has two novel components, namely a feature-based\nstudent-teacher (FBST) framework and a distance-based weights matching (DBWM)\nscheme. Within each user, the FBST framework transfers knowledge from its\nteacher's hidden layers to its student's hidden layers via knowledge\ndistillation, with the teacher and student having identical network structure.\nFor each connected user, its student model's hidden layers' weights are\nuploaded to the EFDLS server periodically. The DBWM scheme is deployed on the\nserver, with the least square distance used to measure the similarity between\nthe weights of two given models. This scheme finds a partner for each connected\nuser such that the user's and its partner's weights are the closest among all\nthe weights uploaded. The server exchanges and sends back the user's and its\npartner's weights to these two users which then load the received weights to\ntheir teachers' hidden layers. Experimental results show that the proposed\nEFDLS achieves excellent performance on a set of selected UCR2018 datasets\nregarding top-1 accuracy.",

Recently, event graphs have been\nexplored to model event datasets and their complex relationships, where events\nare vertices connected to other vertices representing locations, people's\nnames, dates, and various other event metadata. Graph representation learning\nmethods are promising for extracting latent features from event graphs to\nenable the use of different classification algorithms. However, existing\nmethods fail to meet essential requirements for event graphs, such as (i)\ndealing with semi-supervised graph embedding to take advantage of some labeled\nevents, (ii) automatically determining the importance of the relationships\nbetween event vertices and their metadata vertices, as well as (iii) dealing\nwith the graph heterogeneity. This paper presents GNEE (GAT Neural Event\nEmbeddings), a method that combines Graph Attention Networks and Graph\nRegularization. First, an event graph regularization is proposed to ensure that\nall graph vertices receive event features, thereby mitigating the graph\nheterogeneity drawback. Second, semi-supervised graph embedding with\nself-attention mechanism considers existing labeled events, as well as learns\nthe importance of relationships in the event graph during the representation\nlearning process. A statistical analysis of experimental results with five\nreal-world event graphs and six graph embedding methods shows that our GNEE\noutperforms state-of-the-art semi-supervised graph embedding methods.",

          "description": "We aim to provably complete a sparse and highly-missing tensor in the\npresence of covariate information along tensor modes. Our motivation comes from\nonline advertising where users click-through-rates (CTR) on ads over various\ndevices form a CTR tensor that has about 96% missing entries and has many zeros\non non-missing entries, which makes the standalone tensor completion method\nunsatisfactory. Beside the CTR tensor, additional ad features or user\ncharacteristics are often available. In this paper, we propose\nCovariate-assisted Sparse Tensor Completion (COSTCO) to incorporate covariate\ninformation for the recovery of the sparse tensor. The key idea is to jointly\nextract latent components from both the tensor and the covariate matrix to\nlearn a synthetic representation. Theoretically, we derive the error bound for\nthe recovered tensor components and explicitly quantify the improvements on\nboth the reveal probability condition and the tensor recovery accuracy due to\ncovariates. Finally, we apply COSTCO to an advertisement dataset consisting of\na CTR tensor and ad covariate matrix, leading to 23% accuracy improvement over\nthe baseline. An important by-product is that ad latent components from COSTCO\nreveal interesting ad clusters, which are useful for better ad targeting.",

          "description": "In recent years, a variety of gradient-based methods have been developed to\nsolve Bi-Level Optimization (BLO) problems in machine learning and computer\nvision areas. However, the theoretical correctness and practical effectiveness\nof these existing approaches always rely on some restrictive conditions (e.g.,\nLower-Level Singleton, LLS), which could hardly be satisfied in real-world\napplications. Moreover, previous literature only proves theoretical results\nbased on their specific iteration strategies, thus lack a general recipe to\nuniformly analyze the convergence behaviors of different gradient-based BLOs.\nIn this work, we formulate BLOs from an optimistic bi-level viewpoint and\nestablish a new gradient-based algorithmic framework, named Bi-level Descent\nAggregation (BDA), to partially address the above issues. Specifically, BDA\nprovides a modularized structure to hierarchically aggregate both the upper-\nand lower-level subproblems to generate our bi-level iterative dynamics.\nTheoretically, we establish a general convergence analysis template and derive\na new proof recipe to investigate the essential theoretical properties of\ngradient-based BLO methods. Furthermore, this work systematically explores the\nconvergence behavior of BDA in different optimization scenarios, i.e.,\nconsidering various solution qualities (i.e., global/local/stationary solution)\nreturned from solving approximation subproblems. Extensive experiments justify\nour theoretical results and demonstrate the superiority of the proposed\nalgorithm for hyper-parameter optimization and meta-learning tasks.

          "description": "While neural networks have shown remarkable success on classification tasks\nin terms of average-case performance, they often fail to perform well on\ncertain groups of the data. Such group information may be expensive to obtain;\nthus, recent works in robustness and fairness have proposed ways to improve\nworst-group performance even when group labels are unavailable for the training\ndata. However, these methods generally underperform methods that utilize group\ninformation at training time. In this work, we assume access to a small number\nof group labels alongside a larger dataset without group labels. We propose\nBARACK, a simple two-step framework to utilize this partial group information\nto improve worst-group performance: train a model to predict the missing group\nlabels for the training data, and then use these predicted group labels in a\nrobust optimization objective. Theoretically, we provide generalization bounds\nfor our approach in terms of the worst-group performance, showing how the\ngeneralization error scales with respect to both the total number of training\npoints and the number of training points with group labels. Empirically, our\nmethod outperforms the baselines that do not use group information, even when\nonly 1-33% of points have group labels. We provide ablation studies to support\nthe robustness and extensibility of our framework.",

          "description": "A common challenge in large-scale supervised learning, is how to exploit new\nincremental data to a pre-trained model, without re-training the model from\nscratch. Motivated by this problem, we revisit the canonical problem of dynamic\nleast-squares regression (LSR), where the goal is to learn a linear model over\nincremental training data. In this setup, data and labels $(\\mathbf{A}^{(t)},\n\\mathbf{b}^{(t)}) \\in \\mathbb{R}^{t \\times d}\\times \\mathbb{R}^t$ evolve in an\nonline fashion ($t\\gg d$), and the goal is to efficiently maintain an\n(approximate) solution to $\\min_{\\mathbf{x}^{(t)}} \\| \\mathbf{A}^{(t)}\n\\mathbf{x}^{(t)} - \\mathbf{b}^{(t)} \\|_2$ for all $t\\in [T]$. Our main result\nis a dynamic data structure which maintains an arbitrarily small constant\napproximate solution to dynamic LSR with amortized update time $O(d^{1+o(1)})$,\nalmost matching the running time of the static (sketching-based) solution. By\ncontrast, for exact (or even $1/\\mathrm{poly}(n)$-accuracy) solutions, we show\na separation between the static and dynamic settings, namely, that dynamic LSR\nrequires $\\Omega(d^{2-o(1)})$ amortized update time under the OMv Conjecture\n(Henzinger et al., STOC'15).

We focus on designing a homogeneous, objective framework for evaluating\nsamples of algorithmically generated music. Any engineered measures to evaluate\ngenerated music typically attempt to define the samples' musicality, but do not\ncapture qualities of music such as theme or mood. We do not seek to assess the\nmusical merit of generated music, but instead explore whether generated samples\ncontain meaningful information pertaining to emotion or mood/theme. We achieve\nthis by measuring the change in predictive performance of a music mood/theme\nclassifier after augmenting its training data with generated samples. We\nanalyse music samples generated by three models -- SampleRNN, Jukebox, and DDSP\n-- and employ a homogeneous framework across all methods to allow for objective\ncomparison.

          "description": "Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have shown their great ability in modeling graph\nstructured data. However, real-world graphs usually contain structure noises\nand have limited labeled nodes. The performance of GNNs would drop\nsignificantly when trained on such graphs, which hinders the adoption of GNNs\non many applications. Thus, it is important to develop noise-resistant GNNs\nwith limited labeled nodes. However, the work on this is rather limited.\nTherefore, we study a novel problem of developing robust GNNs on noisy graphs\nwith limited labeled nodes. Our analysis shows that both the noisy edges and\nlimited labeled nodes could harm the message-passing mechanism of GNNs. To\nmitigate these issues, we propose a novel framework which adopts the noisy\nedges as supervision to learn a denoised and dense graph, which can down-weight\nor eliminate noisy edges and facilitate message passing of GNNs to alleviate\nthe issue of limited labeled nodes. The generated edges are further used to\nregularize the predictions of unlabeled nodes with label smoothness to better\ntrain GNNs. Experimental results on real-world datasets demonstrate the\nrobustness of the proposed framework on noisy graphs with limited labeled\nnodes.",

Existing unsupervised approaches often suffer\nfrom high computational cost, complex hyperparameter tuning, and limited\ninterpretability, especially when working with large, high-dimensional\ndatasets. To address these issues, we present a simple yet effective algorithm\ncalled ECOD (Empirical-Cumulative-distribution-based Outlier Detection), which\nis inspired by the fact that outliers are often the \"rare events\" that appear\nin the tails of a distribution. In a nutshell, ECOD first estimates the\nunderlying distribution of the input data in a nonparametric fashion by\ncomputing the empirical cumulative distribution per dimension of the data. ECOD\nthen uses these empirical distributions to estimate tail probabilities per\ndimension for each data point. Finally, ECOD computes an outlier score of each\ndata point by aggregating estimated tail probabilities across dimensions. Our\ncontributions are as follows: (1) we propose a novel outlier detection method\ncalled ECOD, which is both parameter-free and easy to interpret; (2) we perform\nextensive experiments on 30 benchmark datasets, where we find that ECOD\noutperforms 11 state-of-the-art baselines in terms of accuracy, efficiency, and\nscalability; and (3) we release an easy-to-use and scalable (with distributed\nsupport) Python implementation for accessibility and reproducibility.",

          "description": "Heat transfer characteristics of nanofluids have been extensively studied\nsince the 1990s. Research investigations show that the suspended nanoparticles\nsignificantly alter the suspension's thermal properties. The thermal\nconductivity of nanofluids is one of the properties that is generally found to\nbe greater than that of the base fluid. This increase in thermal conductivity\nis found to depend on several parameters. Several theories have been proposed\nto model the thermal conductivities of nanofluids, but there is no reliable\nuniversal theory yet to model the anomalous thermal conductivity of nanofluids.\nIn recent years, supervised data-driven methods have been successfully employed\nto create surrogate models across various scientific disciplines, especially\nfor modeling difficult-to-understand phenomena. These supervised learning\nmethods allow the models to capture highly non-linear phenomena. In this work,\nwe have taken advantage of existing correlations and used them concurrently\nwith available experimental results to develop more robust surrogate models for\npredicting the thermal conductivity of nanofluids. Artificial neural networks\nare trained using the transfer learning approach to predict the thermal\nconductivity enhancement of nanofluids with spherical particles for 32\ndifferent particle-fluid combinations (8 particles materials and 4 fluids). The\nlarge amount of lower accuracy data generated from correlations is used to\ncoarse-tune the model parameters, and the limited amount of more trustworthy\nexperimental data is used to fine-tune the model parameters. The transfer\nlearning-based models' results are compared with those from baseline models\nwhich are trained only on experimental data using a goodness of fit metric. It\nis found that the transfer learning models perform better with goodness of fit\nvalues of 0.93 as opposed to 0.83 from the baseline models.",

Considering log data of variant\ndomains, retraining the whole network for unknown domains is inefficient in\nreal industrial scenarios especially for low-resource domains. However,\nprevious deep models merely focused on extracting the semantics of log sequence\nin the same domain, leading to poor generalization on multi-domain logs.\nTherefore, we propose a unified Transformer-based framework for log anomaly\ndetection (\\ourmethod{}), which is comprised of the pretraining and\nadapter-based tuning stage. Our model is first pretrained on the source domain\nto obtain shared semantic knowledge of log data. Then, we transfer the\npretrained model to the target domain via the adapter-based tuning. The\nproposed method is evaluated on three public datasets including one source\ndomain and two target domains.

          "description": "Most semi-supervised learning methods over-sample labeled data when\nconstructing training mini-batches. This paper studies whether this common\npractice improves learning and how. We compare it to an alternative setting\nwhere each mini-batch is uniformly sampled from all the training data, labeled\nor not, which greatly reduces direct supervision from true labels in typical\nlow-label regimes. However, this simpler setting can also be seen as more\ngeneral and even necessary in multi-task problems where over-sampling labeled\ndata would become intractable. Our experiments on semi-supervised CIFAR-10\nimage classification using FixMatch show a performance drop when using the\nuniform sampling approach which diminishes when the amount of labeled data or\nthe training time increases. Further, we analyse the training dynamics to\nunderstand how over-sampling of labeled data compares to uniform sampling. Our\nmain finding is that over-sampling is especially beneficial early in training\nbut gets less important in the later stages when more pseudo-labels become\ncorrect. Nevertheless, we also find that keeping some true labels remains\nimportant to avoid the accumulation of confirmation errors from incorrect\npseudo-labels.",

In this paper, we\ntailor the projected gradient descent (PGD) attack method developed in the\nadversarial learning community as a general-purpose ROA analysis tool for\nlarge-scale nonlinear systems and end-to-end perception-based control. We show\nthat the ROA analysis can be approximated as a constrained maximization problem\nwhose goal is to find the worst-case initial condition which shifts the\nterminal state the most. Then we present two PGD-based iterative methods which\ncan be used to solve the resultant constrained maximization problem. Our\nanalysis is not based on Lyapunov theory, and hence requires minimum\ninformation of the problem structures. In the model-based setting, we show that\nthe PGD updates can be efficiently performed using back-propagation. In the\nmodel-free setting (which is more relevant to ROA analysis of perception-based\ncontrol), we propose a finite-difference PGD estimate which is general and only\nrequires a black-box simulator for generating the trajectories of the\nclosed-loop system given any initial state. We demonstrate the scalability and\ngenerality of our analysis tool on several numerical examples with large-scale\nNN policies and high-dimensional image observations.

We present DiffuseVAE, a novel generative\nframework that integrates VAE within a diffusion model framework, and leverage\nthis to design a novel conditional parameterization for diffusion models. We\nshow that the resulting model can improve upon the unconditional diffusion\nmodel in terms of sampling efficiency while also equipping diffusion models\nwith the low-dimensional VAE inferred latent code. Furthermore, we show that\nthe proposed model can generate high-resolution samples and exhibits synthesis\nquality comparable to state-of-the-art models on standard benchmarks. Lastly,\nwe show that the proposed method can be used for controllable image synthesis\nand also exhibits out-of-the-box capabilities for downstream tasks like image\nsuper-resolution and denoising.

          "description": "The rapid growth of data in the recent years has led to the development of\ncomplex learning algorithms that are often used to make decisions in real\nworld. While the positive impact of the algorithms has been tremendous, there\nis a need to mitigate any bias arising from either training samples or implicit\nassumptions made about the data samples. This need becomes critical when\nalgorithms are used in automated decision making systems that can hugely impact\npeople's lives.\n\nMany approaches have been proposed to make learning algorithms fair by\ndetecting and mitigating bias in different stages of optimization. However, due\nto a lack of a universal definition of fairness, these algorithms optimize for\na particular interpretation of fairness which makes them limited for real world\nuse. Moreover, an underlying assumption that is common to all algorithms is the\napparent equivalence of achieving fairness and removing bias. In other words,\nthere is no user defined criteria that can be incorporated into the\noptimization procedure for producing a fair algorithm. Motivated by these\nshortcomings of existing methods, we propose the CONFAIR procedure that\nproduces a fair algorithm by incorporating user constraints into the\noptimization procedure. Furthermore, we make the process interpretable by\nestimating the most predictive features from data. We demonstrate the efficacy\nof our approach on several real world datasets using different fairness\ncriteria.",

In this paper, we derive a control algorithm that\nmaximizes the future probability of these successful outcome examples.

In contrast, our method directly learns a value function from\ntransitions and successful outcomes, without learning this intermediate reward\nfunction. Our method therefore requires fewer hyperparameters to tune and lines\nof code to debug.

Our work builds upon generative adversarial\nnetworks (GAN) and reinforcement learning, and introduces an imitation learning\nframework where an ensemble of classifiers and an imitation policy are trained\nin tandem given pre-processed reference clips. The classifiers are trained to\ndiscriminate the reference motion from the motion generated by the imitation\npolicy, while the policy is rewarded for fooling the discriminators. Using our\nGAN-based approach, multiple motor control policies can be trained separately\nto imitate different behaviors. In runtime, our system can respond to external\ncontrol signal provided by the user and interactively switch between different\npolicies. Compared to existing methods, our proposed approach has the following\nattractive properties: 1) achieves state-of-the-art imitation performance\nwithout manually designing and fine tuning a reward function; 2) directly\ncontrols the character without having to track any target reference pose\nexplicitly or implicitly through a phase state; and 3) supports interactive\npolicy switching without requiring any motion generation or motion matching\nmechanism. We highlight the applicability of our approach in a range of\nimitation and interactive control tasks, while also demonstrating its ability\nto withstand external perturbations as well as to recover balance. Overall, our\napproach generates high-fidelity motion, has low runtime cost, and can be\neasily integrated into interactive applications and games.",

In this paper, we\nobserve that for many Unsupervised I2I (UI2I) scenarios, one domain is more\nfamiliar than the other, and offers in-domain prior knowledge, such as semantic\nsegmentation. We argue that for complex scenes, figuring out the semantic\nstructure of the domain is hard, especially with no supervision, but is an\nimportant part of a successful I2I operation. We hence introduce two techniques\nto incorporate this invaluable in-domain prior knowledge for the benefit of\ntranslation quality: through a novel Multi-Stream generator architecture, and\nthrough a semantic segmentation-based regularization loss term. In essence, we\npropose splitting the input data according to semantic masks, explicitly\nguiding the network to different behavior for the different regions of the\nimage. In addition, we propose training a semantic segmentation network along\nwith the translation task, and to leverage this output as a loss term that\nimproves robustness. We validate our approach on urban data, demonstrating\nsuperior quality in the challenging UI2I tasks of converting day images to\nnight ones.

The algorithms developed describe an extensive\ntoolkit of methods for circumventing the deleterious effects of noise in the\ncontext of the sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics (SINDy) framework.\nWe offer two primary contributions, both focused on noisy data acquired from a\nsystem x' = f(x). First, we propose, for use in high-noise settings, an\nextensive toolkit of critically enabling extensions for the SINDy regression\nmethod, to progressively cull functionals from an over-complete library and\nyield a set of sparse equations that regress to the derivate x'. These\ninnovations can extract sparse governing equations and coefficients from\nhigh-noise time-series data (e.g. 300% added noise). For example, it discovers\nthe correct sparse libraries in the Lorenz system, with median coefficient\nestimate errors equal to 1% - 3% (for 50% noise), 6% - 8% (for 100% noise); and\n23% - 25% (for 300% noise). The enabling modules in the toolkit are combined\ninto a single method, but the individual modules can be tactically applied in\nother equation discovery methods (SINDy or not) to improve results on\nhigh-noise data. Second, we propose a technique, applicable to any model\ndiscovery method based on x' = f(x), to assess the accuracy of a discovered\nmodel in the context of non-unique solutions due to noisy data. Currently, this\nnon-uniqueness can obscure a discovered model's accuracy and thus a discovery\nmethod's effectiveness. We describe a technique that uses linear dependencies\namong functionals to transform a discovered model into an equivalent form that\nis closest to the true model, enabling more accurate assessment of a discovered\nmodel's accuracy.",

Solving these PDEs\noften requires prohibitively high computational costs, especially when multiple\nevaluations must be made for different parameters or conditions. After\ntraining, neural operators can provide PDEs solutions significantly faster than\ntraditional PDE solvers. In this work, invariance properties and computational\ncomplexity of two neural operators are examined for transport PDE of a scalar\nquantity. Neural operator based on graph kernel network (GKN) operates on\ngraph-structured data to incorporate nonlocal dependencies. Here we propose a\nmodified formulation of GKN to achieve frame invariance. Vector cloud neural\nnetwork (VCNN) is an alternate neural operator with embedded frame invariance\nwhich operates on point cloud data. GKN-based neural operator demonstrates\nslightly better predictive performance compared to VCNN.

          "description": "Federated edge learning (FEEL) has emerged as an effective approach to reduce\nthe large communication latency in Cloud-based machine learning solutions,\nwhile preserving data privacy. Unfortunately, the learning performance of FEEL\nmay be compromised due to limited training data in a single edge cluster. In\nthis paper, we investigate a novel framework of FEEL, namely semi-decentralized\nfederated edge learning (SD-FEEL). By allowing model aggregation across\ndifferent edge clusters, SD-FEEL enjoys the benefit of FEEL in reducing the\ntraining latency, while improving the learning performance by accessing richer\ntraining data from multiple edge clusters. A training algorithm for SD-FEEL\nwith three main procedures in each round is presented, including local model\nupdates, intra-cluster and inter-cluster model aggregations, which is proved to\nconverge on non-independent and identically distributed (non-IID) data. We also\ncharacterize the interplay between the network topology of the edge servers and\nthe communication overhead of inter-cluster model aggregation on the training\nperformance. Experiment results corroborate our analysis and demonstrate the\neffectiveness of SD-FFEL in achieving faster convergence than traditional\nfederated learning architectures. Besides, guidelines on choosing critical\nhyper-parameters of the training algorithm are also provided.",

          "description": "Approximate message passing (AMP) is a promising technique for unknown signal\nreconstruction of certain high-dimensional linear systems with non-Gaussian\nsignaling. A distinguished feature of the AMP-type algorithms is that their\ndynamics can be rigorously described by state evolution. However, state\nevolution does not necessarily guarantee the convergence of iterative\nalgorithms. To solve the convergence problem of AMP-type algorithms in\nprinciple, this paper proposes a memory AMP (MAMP) under a sufficient statistic\ncondition, named sufficient statistic MAMP (SS-MAMP). We show that the\ncovariance matrices of SS-MAMP are L-banded and convergent. Given an arbitrary\nMAMP, we can construct an SS-MAMP by damping, which not only ensures the\nconvergence of MAMP but also preserves the orthogonality of MAMP, i.e., its\ndynamics can be rigorously described by state evolution. As a byproduct, we\nprove that the Bayes-optimal orthogonal/vector AMP (BO-OAMP/VAMP) is an\nSS-MAMP. As a result, we reveal two interesting properties of BO-OAMP/VAMP for\nlarge systems: 1) the covariance matrices are L-banded and are convergent in\nBO-OAMP/VAMP, and 2) damping and memory are useless (i.e., do not bring\nperformance improvement) in BO-OAMP/VAMP. As an example, we construct a\nsufficient statistic Bayes-optimal MAMP (BO-MAMP), which is Bayes optimal if\nits state evolution has a unique fixed point and its MSE is not worse than the\noriginal BO-MAMP. Finally, simulations are provided to verify the validity and\naccuracy of the theoretical results.",

          "description": "Score-based generative models (SGMs) have demonstrated remarkable synthesis\nquality. SGMs rely on a diffusion process that gradually perturbs the data\ntowards a tractable distribution, while the generative model learns to denoise.\nThe complexity of this denoising task is, apart from the data distribution\nitself, uniquely determined by the diffusion process. We argue that current\nSGMs employ overly simplistic diffusions, leading to unnecessarily complex\ndenoising processes, which limit generative modeling performance. Based on\nconnections to statistical mechanics, we propose a novel critically-damped\nLangevin diffusion (CLD) and show that CLD-based SGMs achieve superior\nperformance. CLD can be interpreted as running a joint diffusion in an extended\nspace, where the auxiliary variables can be considered \"velocities\" that are\ncoupled to the data variables as in Hamiltonian dynamics. We derive a novel\nscore matching objective for CLD and show that the model only needs to learn\nthe score function of the conditional distribution of the velocity given data,\nan easier task than learning scores of the data directly. We also derive a new\nsampling scheme for efficient synthesis from CLD-based diffusion models. We\nfind that CLD outperforms previous SGMs in synthesis quality for similar\nnetwork architectures and sampling compute budgets. We show that our novel\nsampler for CLD significantly outperforms solvers such as Euler--Maruyama. Our\nframework provides new insights into score-based denoising diffusion models and\ncan be readily used for high-resolution image synthesis.

With the DANN, only a\nsmall fraction of input configurations (2d images) needs to be labeled, which\nis automatically chosen, in order to capture the critical point. To learn the\nDP model, the method is refined by an iterative procedure in determining the\ncritical point, which is a prerequisite for the data collapse in calculating\nthe critical exponent $\\nu_{\\perp}$. We then apply the DANN to a\ntwo-dimensional site percolation with configurations filtered to include only\nthe largest cluster which may contain the information related to the order\nparameter. The DANN learning of both models yields reliable results which are\ncomparable to the ones from Monte Carlo simulations.

This paper is an effort to provide a unified and\nconstructive framework for the universality of a large class of activations\nincluding most of existing activations and beyond. At the heart of the\nframework is the concept of neural network approximate identity. It turns out\nthat most of existing activations are neural network approximate identity, and\nthus universal in the space of continuous of functions on compacta. The\nframework induces several advantages. First, it is constructive with elementary\nmeans from functional analysis, probability theory, and numerical analysis.\nSecond, it is the first unified attempt that is valid for most of existing\nactivations. Third, as a by product, the framework provides the first\nuniversity proof for some of the existing activation functions including Mish,\nSiLU, ELU, GELU, and etc. Fourth, it discovers new activations with guaranteed\nuniversality property. Indeed, any activation\\textemdash whose $\\k$th\nderivative, with $\\k$ being an integer, is integrable and essentially\nbounded\\textemdash is universal.

          "description": "We present a simple and yet effective interpolation-based regularization\ntechnique to improve the generalization of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). Our\nmethod leverages the recent advances in Mixup regularizer for vision and text,\nwhere random sample pairs and their labels are interpolated to create synthetic\nsamples for training. Unlike images or natural sentences, graphs have arbitrary\nstructure and topology, and even simply deleting or adding one edge from a\ngraph can dramatically change its semantic meanings. This makes interpolating\ngraph inputs very challenging because mixing graph pairs may naturally create\ngraphs with identical structure but with conflict labels, causing the manifold\nintrusion issue. To cope with this obstacle, we propose a simple input mixing\nschema for Mixup on graph, coined ifMixup. We theoretically prove that, with a\nmild assumption, ifMixup guarantees that the mixed graphs are manifold\nintrusion free. We also empirically verify that ifMixup can effectively\nregularize the graph classification learning, resulting in superior predictive\naccuracy over popular graph augmentation baselines.",

          "description": "Realistically -- and equitably -- modeling the dynamics of group-level\ndisparities in machine learning remains an open problem. In particular, we\ndesire models that do not suppose inherent differences between artificial\ngroups of people -- but rather endogenize disparities by appeal to unequal\ninitial conditions of insular subpopulations. In this paper, agents each have a\nreal-valued feature $X$ (e.g., credit score) informed by a \"true\" binary label\n$Y$ representing qualification (e.g., for a loan). Each agent alternately (1)\nreceives a binary classification label $\\hat{Y}$ (e.g., loan approval) from a\nBayes-optimal machine learning classifier observing $X$ and (2) may update\ntheir qualification $Y$ by imitating successful strategies (e.g., seek a raise)\nwithin an isolated group $G$ of agents to which they belong. We consider the\ndisparity of qualification rates $\\Pr(Y=1)$ between different groups and how\nthis disparity changes subject to a sequence of Bayes-optimal classifiers\nrepeatedly retrained on the global population. We model the evolving\nqualification rates of each subpopulation (group) using the replicator\nequation, which derives from a class of imitation processes. We show that\ndifferences in qualification rates between subpopulations can persist\nindefinitely for a set of non-trivial equilibrium states due to uniformed\nclassifier deployments, even when groups are identical in all aspects except\ninitial qualification densities. We next simulate the effects of commonly\nproposed fairness interventions on this dynamical system along with a new\nfeedback control mechanism capable of permanently eliminating group-level\nqualification rate disparities.

In this\nsetting, the agent works in two phases. In the exploration phase, the agent\ninteracts with the environment and collects samples without the reward. In the\nplanning phase, the agent is given a specific reward function and uses samples\ncollected from the exploration phase to learn a good policy. We propose a new\nprovably efficient algorithm, called UCRL-RFE under the Linear Mixture MDP\nassumption, where the transition probability kernel of the MDP can be\nparameterized by a linear function over certain feature mappings defined on the\ntriplet of state, action, and next state.

However, depending on the cost of single\nobservations, multi-dimensional optimizations of one or more objectives may\nstill be prohibitively expensive. Multi-fidelity optimization remedies this\nissue by including multiple, cheaper information sources such as low-resolution\napproximations in numerical simulations. Acquisition functions for\nmulti-fidelity optimization are typically based on exploration-heavy algorithms\nthat are difficult to combine with optimization towards multiple objectives.\n\nHere we show that the expected hypervolume improvement policy can act in many\nsituations as a suitable substitute. We incorporate the evaluation cost either\nvia a two-step evaluation or within a single acquisition function with an\nadditional fidelity-related objective. This permits simultaneous\nmulti-objective and multi-fidelity optimization, which allows to accurately\nestablish the Pareto set and front at fractional cost. Benchmarks show a cost\nreduction of an order of magnitude or more. Our method thus allows for Pareto\noptimization of extremely expansive black-box functions.\n\nThe presented methods are simple and straightforward to implement in\nexisting, optimized Bayesian optimization frameworks and can immediately be\nextended to batch optimization.

          "description": "Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have achieved remarkable success in\nautomatically segmenting organs or lesions on 3D medical images. Recently,\nvision transformer networks have exhibited exceptional performance in 2D image\nclassification tasks. Compared with CNNs, transformer networks have an\nappealing advantage of extracting long-range features due to their\nself-attention algorithm. Therefore, we propose a CNN-Transformer combined\nmodel, called BiTr-Unet, with specific modifications for brain tumor\nsegmentation on multi-modal MRI scans. Our BiTr-Unet achieves good performance\non the BraTS2021 validation dataset with median Dice score 0.9335, 0.9304 and\n0.8899, and median Hausdorff distance 2.8284, 2.2361 and 1.4142 for the whole\ntumor, tumor core, and enhancing tumor, respectively.

Large neural networks employed in the framework are\ntraditionally associated with better generalization capabilities, but their\nincreased size entails the drawbacks of extensive training duration,\nsubstantial hardware resources, and longer inference times. One way to tackle\nthis problem is to prune neural networks leaving only the necessary parameters.\nState-of-the-art concurrent pruning techniques for imposing sparsity perform\ndemonstrably well in applications where data distributions are fixed. However,\nthey have not yet been substantially explored in the context of RL. We close\nthe gap between RL and single-shot pruning techniques and present a general\npruning approach to the Offline RL. We leverage a fixed dataset to prune neural\nnetworks before the start of RL training. We then run experiments varying the\nnetwork sparsity level and evaluating the validity of pruning at initialization\ntechniques in continuous control tasks. Our results show that with 95% of the\nnetwork weights pruned, Offline-RL algorithms can still retain performance in\nthe majority of our experiments. To the best of our knowledge, no prior work\nutilizing pruning in RL retained performance at such high levels of sparsity.\n\nMoreover, pruning at initialization techniques can be easily integrated into\nany existing Offline-RL algorithms without changing the learning objective.",

          "description": "Sampling from an unnormalized probability distribution is a fundamental\nproblem in machine learning with applications including Bayesian modeling,\nlatent factor inference, and energy-based model training. After decades of\nresearch, variations of MCMC remain the default approach to sampling despite\nslow convergence. Auxiliary neural models can learn to speed up MCMC, but the\noverhead for training the extra model can be prohibitive. We propose a\nfundamentally different approach to this problem via a new Hamiltonian dynamics\nwith a non-Newtonian momentum. In contrast to MCMC approaches like Hamiltonian\nMonte Carlo, no stochastic step is required. Instead, the proposed\ndeterministic dynamics in an extended state space exactly sample the target\ndistribution, specified by an energy function, under an assumption of\nergodicity. Alternatively, the dynamics can be interpreted as a normalizing\nflow that samples a specified energy model without training. The proposed\nEnergy Sampling Hamiltonian (ESH) dynamics have a simple form that can be\nsolved with existing ODE solvers, but we derive a specialized solver that\nexhibits much better performance. ESH dynamics converge faster than their MCMC\ncompetitors enabling faster, more stable training of neural network energy\nmodels.",

          "description": "The effectiveness of traditional traffic prediction methods is often\nextremely limited when forecasting traffic dynamics in early morning. The\nreason is that traffic can break down drastically during the early morning\ncommute, and the time and duration of this break-down vary substantially from\nday to day. Early morning traffic forecast is crucial to inform morning-commute\ntraffic management, but they are generally challenging to predict in advance,\nparticularly by midnight. In this paper, we propose to mine Twitter messages as\na probing method to understand the impacts of people's work and rest patterns\nin the evening/midnight of the previous day to the next-day morning traffic.\nThe model is tested on freeway networks in Pittsburgh as experiments. The\nresulting relationship is surprisingly simple and powerful. We find that, in\ngeneral, the earlier people rest as indicated from Tweets, the more congested\nroads will be in the next morning. The occurrence of big events in the evening\nbefore, represented by higher or lower tweet sentiment than normal, often\nimplies lower travel demand in the next morning than normal days. Besides,\npeople's tweeting activities in the night before and early morning are\nstatistically associated with congestion in morning peak hours. We make use of\nsuch relationships to build a predictive framework which forecasts morning\ncommute congestion using people's tweeting profiles extracted by 5 am or as\nlate as the midnight prior to the morning. The Pittsburgh study supports that\nour framework can precisely predict morning congestion, particularly for some\nroad segments upstream of roadway bottlenecks with large day-to-day congestion\nvariation. Our approach considerably outperforms those existing methods without\nTwitter message features, and it can learn meaningful representation of demand\nfrom tweeting profiles that offer managerial insights.",

Conditional feature contributions (CFCs)\nprovide \\textit{local}, case-by-case explanations of a prediction by following\nthe decision path and attributing changes in the expected output of the model\nto each feature along the path. However, Lundberg et al. pointed out a\npotential bias of CFCs which depends on the distance from the root of a tree.\nThe by now immensely popular alternative, SHapley Additive exPlanation (SHAP)\nvalues appear to mitigate this bias but are computationally much more\nexpensive. Here we contribute a thorough comparison of the explanations\ncomputed by both methods on a set of 164 publicly available classification\nproblems in order to provide data-driven algorithm recommendations to current\nresearchers. For random forests, we find extremely high similarities and\ncorrelations of both local and global SHAP values and CFC scores, leading to\nvery similar rankings and interpretations.

When the environment only provides observations giving partial\ninformation about the state of the environment, the agent must learn the agent\nstate based on the data stream of experience. We refer to the state learned\ndirectly from the data stream of experience as the agent state. Recurrent\nneural networks can learn the agent state, but the training methods are\ncomputationally expensive and sensitive to the hyper-parameters, making them\nunideal for online learning. This work introduces methods based on the\ngenerate-and-test approach to learn the agent state. A generate-and-test\nalgorithm searches for state features by generating features and testing their\nusefulness. In this process, features useful for the agent's performance on the\ntask are preserved, and the least useful features get replaced with newly\ngenerated features. We study the effectiveness of our methods on two online\nmulti-step prediction problems. The first problem, trace conditioning, focuses\non the agent's ability to remember a cue for a prediction multiple steps into\nthe future. In the second problem, trace patterning, the agent needs to learn\npatterns in the observation signals and remember them for future predictions.\nWe show that our proposed methods can effectively learn the agent state online\nand produce accurate predictions.",

In\napplications that are constrained by memory and computational intensity,\nexcessively large datasets may hinder scientific discovery, making data\nreduction a critical component of data-driven methods. Datasets are growing in\ntwo directions: the number of data points and their dimensionality. Whereas\ndata compression techniques are concerned with reducing dimensionality, the\nfocus here is on reducing the number of data points. A strategy is proposed to\nselect data points such that they uniformly span the phase-space of the data.\nThe algorithm proposed relies on estimating the probability map of the data and\nusing it to construct an acceptance probability. An iterative method is used to\naccurately estimate the probability of the rare data points when only a small\nsubset of the dataset is used to construct the probability map. Instead of\nbinning the phase-space to estimate the probability map, its functional form is\napproximated with a normalizing flow. Therefore, the method naturally extends\nto high-dimensional datasets. The proposed framework is demonstrated as a\nviable pathway to enable data-efficient machine learning when abundant data is\navailable.

Our study focuses on two datasets: iWildCam and FMoW.\nWe show that (1) Conducting separate cross-validation for each evaluation\nmetric is crucial for both datasets, (2) A weak correlation between validation\nand test performance might make model development difficult for iWildCam, (3)\nMinor changes in the training of hyper-parameters improve the baseline by a\nrelatively large margin (mainly on FMoW), (4) There is a strong correlation\nbetween certain domains and certain target labels (mainly on iWildCam).

          "description": "Kidney DCE-MRI aims at both qualitative assessment of kidney anatomy and\nquantitative assessment of kidney function by estimating the tracer kinetic\n(TK) model parameters. Accurate estimation of TK model parameters requires an\naccurate measurement of the arterial input function (AIF) with high temporal\nresolution. Accelerated imaging is used to achieve high temporal resolution,\nwhich yields under-sampling artifacts in the reconstructed images. Compressed\nsensing (CS) methods offer a variety of reconstruction options. Most commonly,\nsparsity of temporal differences is encouraged for regularization to reduce\nartifacts. Increasing regularization in CS methods removes the ambient\nartifacts but also over-smooths the signal temporally which reduces the\nparameter estimation accuracy. In this work, we propose a single image trained\ndeep neural network to reduce MRI under-sampling artifacts without reducing the\naccuracy of functional imaging markers. Instead of regularizing with a penalty\nterm in optimization, we promote regularization by generating images from a\nlower dimensional representation. In this manuscript we motivate and explain\nthe lower dimensional input design. We compare our approach to CS\nreconstructions with multiple regularization weights. Proposed approach results\nin kidney biomarkers that are highly correlated with the ground truth markers\nestimated using the CS reconstruction which was optimized for functional\nanalysis. At the same time, the proposed approach reduces the artifacts in the\nreconstructed images.",

Our method is\ncomputationally efficient and trained only with self-supervised learning on\ngeneral images, without requiring any adversarial training or retraining of the\nclassification model. We first show an empirical analysis on the adversarial\nnoise, defined to be the residual between an original image and its adversarial\nexample, has almost zero mean, symmetric distribution. Based on this\nobservation, we propose a very simple iterative Gaussian Smoothing (GS) which\ncan effectively smooth out adversarial noise and achieve substantially high\nrobust accuracy. To further improve it, we propose Neural Contextual Iterative\nSmoothing (NCIS), which trains a blind-spot network (BSN) in a self-supervised\nmanner to reconstruct the discriminative features of the original image that is\nalso smoothed out by GS. From our extensive experiments on the large-scale\nImageNet using four classification models, we show that our method achieves\nboth competitive standard accuracy and state-of-the-art robust accuracy against\nmost strong purifier-blind white- and black-box attacks. Also, we propose a new\nbenchmark for evaluating a purification method based on commercial image\nclassification APIs, such as AWS, Azure, Clarifai and Google.

          "description": "This paper analyzes a two-timescale stochastic algorithm framework for\nbilevel optimization. Bilevel optimization is a class of problems which exhibit\na two-level structure, and its goal is to minimize an outer objective function\nwith variables which are constrained to be the optimal solution to an (inner)\noptimization problem. We consider the case when the inner problem is\nunconstrained and strongly convex, while the outer problem is constrained and\nhas a smooth objective function. We propose a two-timescale stochastic\napproximation (TTSA) algorithm for tackling such a bilevel problem. In the\nalgorithm, a stochastic gradient update with a larger step size is used for the\ninner problem, while a projected stochastic gradient update with a smaller step\nsize is used for the outer problem. We analyze the convergence rates for the\nTTSA algorithm under various settings: when the outer problem is strongly\nconvex (resp.~weakly convex), the TTSA algorithm finds an\n$\\mathcal{O}(K^{-2/3})$-optimal (resp.~$\\mathcal{O}(K^{-2/5})$-stationary)\nsolution, where $K$ is the total iteration number.

Further, the model is regularized to\nalign the importance scores with human knowledge, so that the unintended model\nbehaviors are eliminated. However, such a regularization technique lacks\nflexibility and coverage, since only importance scores towards a pre-defined\nlist of features are adjusted, while more complex human knowledge such as\nfeature interaction and pattern generalization can hardly be incorporated. In\nthis work, we propose to refine a learned language model for a target domain by\ncollecting human-provided compositional explanations regarding observed biases.\nBy parsing these explanations into executable logic rules, the human-specified\nrefinement advice from a small set of explanations can be generalized to more\ntraining examples.

In the training\nprocess, we supply the same input to the two modules and then extract their\nfeature distribution and prediction results respectively. We propose a\ndiscrepancy loss to find the discrepancy of the prediction results and the\nfeature distribution between the two modules. Through the adversarial training\nby maximizing the loss of their feature distribution and minimizing the\ndiscrepancy of their prediction results, the two modules are encouraged to\nlearn more domain discriminative and domain invariant features respectively.\nExtensive comparative evaluations are conducted and the proposed approach\noutperforms the state-of-the-art in most unsupervised domain adaptation tasks.",

          "description": "Despite recent advances in modern machine learning algorithms, the opaqueness\nof their underlying mechanisms continues to be an obstacle in adoption. To\ninstill confidence and trust in artificial intelligence systems, Explainable\nArtificial Intelligence has emerged as a response to improving modern machine\nlearning algorithms' explainability. Inductive Logic Programming (ILP), a\nsubfield of symbolic artificial intelligence, plays a promising role in\ngenerating interpretable explanations because of its intuitive logic-driven\nframework. ILP effectively leverages abductive reasoning to generate\nexplainable first-order clausal theories from examples and background\nknowledge. However, several challenges in developing methods inspired by ILP\nneed to be addressed for their successful application in practice. For example,\nexisting ILP systems often have a vast solution space, and the induced\nsolutions are very sensitive to noises and disturbances. This survey paper\nsummarizes the recent advances in ILP and a discussion of statistical\nrelational learning and neural-symbolic algorithms, which offer synergistic\nviews to ILP. Following a critical review of the recent advances, we delineate\nobserved challenges and highlight potential avenues of further ILP-motivated\nresearch toward developing self-explanatory artificial intelligence systems.",

When data points are observed in uneven time intervals the time\nseries is referred to as irregular or intermittent. In such scenarios, the most\ncommon solution is to reconstruct the time series to make it regular, thus\nremoving its intermittency. We hypothesise that, in irregular time series, the\ntime at which each observation is collected may be helpful to summarise the\ndynamics of the data and improve forecasting performance. We study this idea by\ndeveloping a novel automatic feature engineering framework, which focuses on\nextracting information from this point of view, i.e., when each instance is\ncollected. We study how valuable this information is by integrating it in a\ntime series forecasting workflow and investigate how it compares to or\ncomplements state-of-the-art methods for regular time series forecasting. In\nthe end, we contribute by providing a novel framework that tackles feature\nengineering for time series from an angle previously vastly ignored.

One aspect that has\nbeen obviated so far, is the fact that how we represent the skeletal pose has a\ncritical impact on the prediction results. Yet there is no effort that\ninvestigates across different pose representation schemes. We conduct an\nindepth study on various pose representations with a focus on their effects on\nthe motion prediction task. Moreover, recent approaches build upon\noff-the-shelf RNN units for motion prediction. These approaches process input\npose sequence sequentially and inherently have difficulties in capturing\nlong-term dependencies. In this paper, we propose a novel RNN architecture\ntermed AHMR (Attentive Hierarchical Motion Recurrent network) for motion\nprediction which simultaneously models local motion contexts and a global\ncontext. We further explore a geodesic loss and a forward kinematics loss for\nthe motion prediction task, which have more geometric significance than the\nwidely employed L2 loss. Interestingly, we applied our method to a range of\narticulate objects including human, fish, and mouse.

In this\nregard, a robust deep learning-based framework is proposed for computation of\nlow latency, continuous, and calibration-free upper and lower bounds on the\nsystolic and diastolic BP. Method: Referred to as the BP-Net, the proposed\nframework is a novel convolutional architecture that provides longer effective\nmemory while achieving superior performance due to incorporation of casual\ndialated convolutions and residual connections. To utilize the real potential\nof deep learning in extraction of intrinsic features (deep features) and\nenhance the long-term robustness, the BP-Net uses raw Electrocardiograph (ECG)\nand Photoplethysmograph (PPG) signals without extraction of any form of\nhand-crafted features as it is common in existing solutions. Results: By\ncapitalizing on the fact that datasets used in recent literature are not\nunified and properly defined, a benchmark dataset is constructed from the\nMIMIC-I and MIMIC-III databases obtained from PhysioNet. The proposed BP-Net is\nevaluated based on this benchmark dataset demonstrating promising performance\nand shows superior generalizable capacity. Conclusion: The proposed BP-Net\narchitecture is more accurate than canonical recurrent networks and enhances\nthe long-term robustness of the BP estimation task. Significance: The proposed\nBP-Net architecture addresses key drawbacks of existing BP estimation\nsolutions, i.e., relying heavily on extraction of hand-crafted features, such\nas pulse arrival time (PAT), and; Lack of robustness.

Conventional Model-Based (MB) or Model-Free (MF)\nRL algorithms are not directly applicable to the MARL problems due to\nutilization of a fixed reward model for learning the underlying value function.\nWhile DNN-based solutions perform utterly well when a single agent is involved,\nsuch methods fail to fully generalize to the complexities of MARL problems. In\nother words, although recently developed approaches based on DNNs for\nmulti-agent environments have achieved superior performance, they are still\nprone to overfiting, high sensitivity to parameter selection, and sample\ninefficiency. The paper proposes the Multi-Agent Adaptive Kalman Temporal\nDifference (MAK-TD) framework and its Successor Representation-based variant,\nreferred to as the MAK-SR. Intuitively speaking, the main objective is to\ncapitalize on unique characteristics of Kalman Filtering (KF) such as\nuncertainty modeling and online second order learning. The proposed MAK-TD/SR\nframeworks consider the continuous nature of the action-space that is\nassociated with high dimensional multi-agent environments and exploit Kalman\nTemporal Difference (KTD) to address the parameter uncertainty. By leveraging\nthe KTD framework, SR learning procedure is modeled into a filtering problem,\nwhere Radial Basis Function (RBF) estimators are used to encode the continuous\nspace into feature vectors. On the other hand, for learning localized reward\nfunctions, we resort to Multiple Model Adaptive Estimation (MMAE), to deal with\nthe lack of prior knowledge on the observation noise covariance and observation\nmapping function. The proposed MAK-TD/SR frameworks are evaluated via several\nexperiments, which are implemented through the OpenAI Gym MARL benchmarks.",

          "description": "In dynamic programming (DP) and reinforcement learning (RL), an agent learns\nto act optimally in terms of expected long-term return by sequentially\ninteracting with its environment modeled by a Markov decision process (MDP).\nMore generally in distributional reinforcement learning (DRL), the focus is on\nthe whole distribution of the return, not just its expectation. Although\nDRL-based methods produced state-of-the-art performance in RL with function\napproximation, they involve additional quantities (compared to the\nnon-distributional setting) that are still not well understood. As a first\ncontribution, we introduce a new class of distributional operators, together\nwith a practical DP algorithm for policy evaluation, that come with a robust\nMDP interpretation. Indeed, our approach reformulates through an augmented\nstate space where each state is split into a worst-case substate and a\nbest-case substate, whose values are maximized by safe and risky policies\nrespectively. Finally, we derive distributional operators and DP algorithms\nsolving a new control task: How to distinguish safe from risky optimal actions\nin order to break ties in the space of optimal policies?",

          "description": "Web-based interactions can be frequently represented by an attributed graph,\nand node clustering in such graphs has received much attention lately. Multiple\nefforts have successfully applied Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN), though\nwith some limits on accuracy as GCNs have been shown to suffer from\nover-smoothing issues. Though other methods (particularly those based on\nLaplacian Smoothing) have reported better accuracy, a fundamental limitation of\nall the work is a lack of scalability. This paper addresses this open problem\nby relating the Laplacian smoothing to the Generalized PageRank and applying a\nrandom-walk based algorithm as a scalable graph filter. This forms the basis\nfor our scalable deep clustering algorithm, RwSL, where through a\nself-supervised mini-batch training mechanism, we simultaneously optimize a\ndeep neural network for sample-cluster assignment distribution and an\nautoencoder for a clustering-oriented embedding. Using 6 real-world datasets\nand 6 clustering metrics, we show that RwSL achieved improved results over\nseveral recent baselines. Most notably, we show that RwSL, unlike all other\ndeep clustering frameworks, can continue to scale beyond graphs with more than\none million nodes, i.e., handle web-scale. We also demonstrate how RwSL could\nperform node clustering on a graph with 1.8 billion edges using only a single\nGPU.",

HDC/VSA operate with\nhypervectors, i.e., distributed vector representations of large fixed dimension\n(usually > 1000). One of the key ingredients of HDC/VSA are the methods for\nencoding data of various types (from numeric scalars and vectors to graphs)\ninto hypervectors. In this paper, we propose an approach for the formation of\nhypervectors of sequences that provides both an equivariance with respect to\nthe shift of sequences and preserves the similarity of sequences with identical\nelements at nearby positions. Our methods represent the sequence elements by\ncompositional hypervectors and exploit permutations of hypervectors for\nrepresenting the order of sequence elements. We experimentally explored the\nproposed representations using a diverse set of tasks with data in the form of\nsymbolic strings. Although our approach is feature-free as it forms the\nhypervector of a sequence from the hypervectors of its symbols at their\npositions, it demonstrated the performance on a par with the methods that apply\nvarious features, such as subsequences. The proposed techniques were designed\nfor the HDC/VSA model known as Sparse Binary Distributed Representations.\nHowever, they can be adapted to hypervectors in formats of other HDC/VSA\nmodels, as well as for representing sequences of types other than symbolic\nstrings.",

Specifically, we first utilize\nbi-directional global spatial and local temporal information of POIs to capture\nthe complex dependence relationships. Then, target temporal pattern in\ncombination with user and POI information are fed into a multi-layer network to\ncapture users' dynamic preferences. Moreover, the dynamic preferences are\ntransformed into the same space as the dependence relationships to form the\nfinal model. Finally, the proposed model is evaluated on three large-scale\nreal-world datasets and the results demonstrate significant improvements of our\nmodel compared with state-of-the-art methods.

Inspired by this, we look at the\nrelationship between i) a weak form of information loss in the Shannon sense\nand ii) the operation loss in the minimum probability of error (MPE) sense when\nconsidering a family of lossy continuous representations (features) of a\ncontinuous observation. We present several results that shed light on this\ninterplay. Our first result offers a lower bound on a weak form of information\nloss as a function of its respective operation loss when adopting a discrete\nlossy representation (quantization) instead of the original raw observation.\nFrom this, our main result shows that a specific form of vanishing information\nloss (a weak notion of asymptotic informational sufficiency) implies a\nvanishing MPE loss (or asymptotic operational sufficiency) when considering a\ngeneral family of lossy continuous representations. Our theoretical findings\nsupport the observation that the selection of feature representations that\nattempt to capture informational sufficiency is appropriate for learning, but\nthis selection is a rather conservative design principle if the intended goal\nis achieving MPE in classification. Supporting this last point, and under some\nstructural conditions, we show that it is possible to adopt an alternative\nnotion of informational sufficiency (strictly weaker than pure sufficiency in\nthe mutual information sense) to achieve operational sufficiency in learning.",

          "description": "The displacement of two immiscible fluids is a common problem in fluid flow\nin porous media. Such a problem can be posed as a partial differential equation\n(PDE) in what is commonly referred to as a Buckley-Leverett (B-L) problem. The\nB-L problem is a non-linear hyperbolic conservation law that is known to be\nnotoriously difficult to solve using traditional numerical methods. Here, we\naddress the forward hyperbolic B-L problem with a nonconvex flux function using\nphysics-informed neural networks (PINNs). The contributions of this paper are\ntwofold. First, we present a PINN approach to solve the hyperbolic B-L problem\nby embedding the Oleinik entropy condition into the neural network residual. We\ndo not use a diffusion term (artificial viscosity) in the residual-loss, but we\nrely on the strong form of the PDE. Second, we use the Adam optimizer with\nresidual-based adaptive refinement (RAR) algorithm to achieve an ultra-low loss\nwithout weighting. Our solution method can accurately capture the shock-front\nand produce an accurate overall solution. We report a L2 validation error of 2\nx 10-2 and a L2 loss of 1x 10-6. The proposed method does not require any\nadditional regularization or weighting of losses to obtain such accurate\nsolution.",

          "description": "The recent success of deep learning applications has coincided with those\nwidely available powerful computational resources for training sophisticated\nmachine learning models with huge datasets. Nonetheless, training large models\nsuch as convolutional neural networks using model parallelism (as opposed to\ndata parallelism) is challenging because the complex nature of communication\nbetween model shards makes it difficult to partition the computation\nefficiently across multiple machines with an acceptable trade-off. This paper\npresents SplitBrain, a high performance distributed deep learning framework\nsupporting hybrid data and model parallelism. Specifically, SplitBrain provides\nlayer-specific partitioning that co-locates compute intensive convolutional\nlayers while sharding memory demanding layers. A novel scalable group\ncommunication is proposed to further improve the training throughput with\nreduced communication overhead. The results show that SplitBrain can achieve\nnearly linear speedup while saving up to 67\\% of memory consumption for data\nand model parallel VGG over CIFAR-10.",

          "description": "Learning powerful representations is one central theme of graph neural\nnetworks (GNNs). It requires refining the critical information from the input\ngraph, instead of the trivial patterns, to enrich the representations. Towards\nthis end, graph attention and pooling methods prevail. They mostly follow the\nparadigm of \"learning to attend\". It maximizes the mutual information between\nthe attended subgraph and the ground-truth label. However, this training\nparadigm is prone to capture the spurious correlations between the trivial\nsubgraph and the label. Such spurious correlations are beneficial to\nin-distribution (ID) test evaluations, but cause poor generalization in the\nout-of-distribution (OOD) test data. In this work, we revisit the GNN modeling\nfrom the causal perspective. On the top of our causal assumption, the trivial\ninformation serves as a confounder between the critical information and the\nlabel, which opens a backdoor path between them and makes them spuriously\ncorrelated. Hence, we present a new paradigm of deconfounded training (DTP)\nthat better mitigates the confounding effect and latches on the critical\ninformation, to enhance the representation and generalization ability.\nSpecifically, we adopt the attention modules to disentangle the critical\nsubgraph and trivial subgraph. Then we make each critical subgraph fairly\ninteract with diverse trivial subgraphs to achieve a stable prediction. It\nallows GNNs to capture a more reliable subgraph whose relation with the label\nis robust across different distributions. We conduct extensive experiments on\nsynthetic and real-world datasets to demonstrate the effectiveness.",

We introduce an optimal transport\ndistance for evaluating the authenticity of the generated dance distribution\nand a Gromov-Wasserstein distance to measure the correspondence between the\ndance distribution and the input music. This gives a well defined and\nnon-divergent training objective that mitigates the limitation of standard GAN\ntraining which is frequently plagued with instability and divergent generator\nloss issues.

          "description": "Multi-class classification is one of the most common tasks in machine\nlearning applications, where data is labeled by one of many class labels. Many\nloss functions have been proposed for multi-class classification including two\nwell-known ones, namely the cross-entropy (CE) loss and the crammer-singer (CS)\nloss (aka. the SVM loss). While CS loss has been used widely for traditional\nmachine learning tasks, CE loss is usually a default choice for multi-class\ndeep learning tasks. There are also top-$k$ variants of CS loss and CE loss\nthat are proposed to promote the learning of a classifier for achieving better\ntop-$k$ accuracy. Nevertheless, it still remains unclear the relationship\nbetween these different losses, which hinders our understanding of their\nexpectations in different scenarios. In this paper, we present a unified view\nof the CS/CE losses and their smoothed top-$k$ variants by proposing a new\nfamily of loss functions, which are arguably better than the CS/CE losses when\nthe given label information is incomplete and noisy. The new family of smooth\nloss functions named {label-distributionally robust (LDR) loss} is defined by\nleveraging the distributionally robust optimization (DRO) framework to model\nthe uncertainty in the given label information, where the uncertainty over true\nclass labels is captured by using distributional weights for each label\nregularized by a function.",

          "description": "Accurate decoding of surface electromyography (sEMG) is pivotal for\nmuscle-to-machine-interfaces (MMI) and their application for e.g.\nrehabilitation therapy. sEMG signals have high inter-subject variability, due\nto various factors, including skin thickness, body fat percentage, and\nelectrode placement. Therefore, obtaining high generalization quality of a\ntrained sEMG decoder is quite challenging. Usually, machine learning based sEMG\ndecoders are either trained on subject-specific data, or at least recalibrated\nfor each user, individually. Even though, deep learning algorithms produced\nseveral state of the art results for sEMG decoding,however, due to the limited\namount of availability of sEMG data, the deep learning models are prone to\noverfitting. Recently, transfer learning for domain adaptation improved\ngeneralization quality with reduced training time on various machine learning\ntasks. In this study, we investigate the effectiveness of transfer learning\nusing weight initialization for recalibration of two different pretrained deep\nlearning models on a new subjects data, and compare their performance to\nsubject-specific models. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study\nthat thoroughly investigated weight-initialization based transfer learning for\nsEMG classification and compared transfer learning to subject-specific\nmodeling. We tested our models on three publicly available databases under\nvarious settings. On average over all settings, our transfer learning approach\nimproves 5~\\%-points on the pretrained models without fine-tuning and\n12~\\%-points on the subject-specific models, while being trained on average\n22~\\% fewer epochs. Our results indicate that transfer learning enables faster\ntraining on fewer samples than user-specific models, and improves the\nperformance of pretrained models as long as enough data is available.",

          "description": "Recent advances in machine learning have largely benefited from the massive\naccessible training data. However, large-scale data sharing has raised great\nprivacy concerns. In this work, we propose a novel privacy-preserving data\nGenerative model based on the PATE framework (G-PATE), aiming to train a\nscalable differentially private data generator that preserves high generated\ndata utility. Our approach leverages generative adversarial nets to generate\ndata, combined with private aggregation among different discriminators to\nensure strong privacy guarantees. Compared to existing approaches, G-PATE\nsignificantly improves the use of privacy budgets. In particular, we train a\nstudent data generator with an ensemble of teacher discriminators and propose a\nnovel private gradient aggregation mechanism to ensure differential privacy on\nall information that flows from teacher discriminators to the student\ngenerator. In addition, with random projection and gradient discretization, the\nproposed gradient aggregation mechanism is able to effectively deal with\nhigh-dimensional gradient vectors. Theoretically, we prove that G-PATE ensures\ndifferential privacy for the data generator. Empirically, we demonstrate the\nsuperiority of G-PATE over prior work through extensive experiments.

          "description": "This work is focused on the pruning of some convolutional neural networks\n(CNNs) and improving theirs efficiency on graphic processing units (GPU) by\nusing a direct sparse algorithm. The Nvidia deep neural network (cuDnn) library\nis the most effective implementations of deep learning (DL) algorithms for\nGPUs. GPUs are the most commonly used accelerators for deep learning\ncomputations. One of the most common techniques for improving the efficiency of\nCNN models is weight pruning and quantization. There are two main types of\npruning: structural and non-structural. The first enables much easier\nacceleration on many type of accelerators, but with this type it is difficult\nto achieve a sparsity level and accuracy as high as that obtained with the\nsecond type. Non-structural pruning with retraining can generate a weight\ntensors up to 90% or more of sparsity in some deep CNN models. In this article\nthe pruning algorithm is presented which makes it possible to achieve high\nsparsity levels without accuracy drop. In the next stage the linear and\nnon-linear quantization is adapted for further time and footprint reduction.\nThis paper is an extended of previously published paper concerning effective\npruning techniques and present real models pruned with high sparsities and\nreduced precision which can achieve better performance than the CuDnn library.",

          "description": "Approximate message passing (AMP) is a low-cost iterative\nparameter-estimation technique for certain high-dimensional linear systems with\nnon-Gaussian distributions. However, AMP only applies to independent\nidentically distributed (IID) transform matrices, but may become unreliable\n(e.g., perform poorly or even diverge) for other matrix ensembles, especially\nfor ill-conditioned ones. Orthogonal/vector AMP (OAMP/VAMP) was proposed for\ngeneral right-unitarily-invariant matrices to handle this difficulty. However,\nthe Bayes-optimal OAMP/VAMP (BO-OAMP/VAMP) requires a high-complexity linear\nminimum mean square error (MMSE) estimator. This limits the application of\nOAMP/VAMP to large-scale systems.\n\nTo solve the disadvantages of AMP and BO-OAMP/VAMP, this paper proposes a\nmemory AMP (MAMP) framework under an orthogonality principle, which guarantees\nthe asymptotic IID Gaussianity of estimation errors in MAMP. We present an\northogonalization procedure for the local memory estimators to realize the\nrequired orthogonality for MAMP. Furthermore, we propose a Bayes-optimal MAMP\n(BO-MAMP), in which a long-memory matched filter is proposed for interference\nsuppression. The complexity of BO-MAMP is comparable to AMP. A state evolution\nis derived to asymptotically characterize the performance of BO-MAMP. Based on\nstate evolution, the relaxation parameters and damping vector in BO-MAMP are\noptimized. For all right-unitarily-invariant matrices, the state evolution of\nthe optimized BO-MAMP converges to the same fixed point as that of the\nhigh-complexity BO-OAMP/VAMP and is Bayes-optimal if its state evolution has a\nunique fixed point. Finally, simulations are provided to verify the validity\nand accuracy of the theoretical results.",

However, some existing network theories and prediction models\nindicate that long ties might dissolve quickly or eventually become redundant,\nthus putting into question the long-term value of long ties. Our empirical\nanalysis of real-world dynamic networks shows that contrary to such reasoning,\nlong ties are more likely to persist than other social ties, and that many of\nthem constantly function as social bridges without being embedded in local\nnetworks. Using a novel cost-benefit analysis model combined with machine\nlearning, we show that long ties are highly beneficial, which instinctively\nmotivates people to expend extra effort to maintain them. This partly explains\nwhy long ties are more persistent than what has been suggested by many existing\ntheories and models.

          "description": "Graphs can model complicated interactions between entities, which naturally\nemerge in many important applications. These applications can often be cast\ninto standard graph learning tasks, in which a crucial step is to learn\nlow-dimensional graph representations. Graph neural networks (GNNs) are\ncurrently the most popular model in graph embedding approaches. However,\nstandard GNNs in the neighborhood aggregation paradigm suffer from limited\ndiscriminative power in distinguishing \\emph{high-order} graph structures as\nopposed to \\emph{low-order} structures. To capture high-order structures,\nresearchers have resorted to motifs and developed motif-based GNNs. However,\nexisting motif-based GNNs still often suffer from less discriminative power on\nhigh-order structures. To overcome the above limitations, we propose Motif\nGraph Neural Network (MGNN), a novel framework to better capture high-order\nstructures, hinging on our proposed motif redundancy minimization operator and\ninjective motif combination. First, MGNN produces a set of node representations\nw.r.t. each motif. The next phase is our proposed redundancy minimization among\nmotifs which compares the motifs with each other and distills the features\nunique to each motif. Finally, MGNN performs the updating of node\nrepresentations by combining multiple representations from different motifs. In\nparticular, to enhance the discriminative power, MGNN utilizes an injective\nfunction to combine the representations w.r.t. different motifs. We further\nshow that our proposed architecture increases the expressive power of GNNs with\na theoretical analysis. We demonstrate that MGNN outperforms state-of-the-art\nmethods on seven public benchmarks on both node classification and graph\nclassification tasks.",

          "description": "Recently, Vision Transformer (ViT) has continuously established new\nmilestones in the computer vision field, while the high computation and memory\ncost makes its propagation in industrial production difficult. Pruning, a\ntraditional model compression paradigm for hardware efficiency, has been widely\napplied in various DNN structures. Nevertheless, it stays ambiguous on how to\nperform exclusive pruning on the ViT structure. Considering three key points:\nthe structural characteristics, the internal data pattern of ViTs, and the\nrelated edge device deployment, we leverage the input token sparsity and\npropose a computation-aware soft pruning framework, which can be set up on\nvanilla Transformers of both flatten and CNN-type structures, such as\nPooling-based ViT (PiT). More concretely, we design a dynamic attention-based\nmulti-head token selector, which is a lightweight module for adaptive\ninstance-wise token selection. We further introduce a soft pruning technique,\nwhich integrates the less informative tokens generated by the selector module\ninto a package token that will participate in subsequent calculations rather\nthan being completely discarded. Our framework is bound to the trade-off\nbetween accuracy and computation constraints of specific edge devices through\nour proposed computation-aware training strategy. Experimental results show\nthat our framework significantly reduces the computation cost of ViTs while\nmaintaining comparable performance on image classification. Moreover, our\nframework can guarantee the identified model to meet resource specifications of\nmobile devices and FPGA, and even achieve the real-time execution of DeiT-T on\nmobile platforms. For example, our method reduces the latency of DeiT-T to 26\nms (26%$\\sim $41% superior to existing works) on the mobile device with\n0.25%$\\sim $4% higher top-1 accuracy on ImageNet.

A simple but effective method to\ndeal with large graphs is to train them in the distributed settings, and some\ndistributed K-core decomposition algorithms are also proposed.

          "description": "One of the main challenges of Topological Data Analysis (TDA) is to extract\nfeatures from persistent diagrams directly usable by machine learning\nalgorithms. Indeed, persistence diagrams are intrinsically (multi-)sets of\npoints in R2 and cannot be seen in a straightforward manner as vectors. In this\narticle, we introduce Persformer, the first Transformer neural network\narchitecture that accepts persistence diagrams as input. The Persformer\narchitecture significantly outperforms previous topological neural network\narchitectures on classical synthetic benchmark datasets. Moreover, it satisfies\na universal approximation theorem. This allows us to introduce the first\ninterpretability method for topological machine learning, which we explore in\ntwo examples.",

To this\nend, we contribute a cross-modal representation-learning model, which 1)\nextracts chord and melodic information from the audio, and 2) learns texture\nrepresentation from both audio and a corrupted ground truth arrangement.

          "description": "Objective: To determine if a realistic, but computationally efficient model\nof the electrocardiogram can be used to pre-train a deep neural network (DNN)\nwith a wide range of morphologies and abnormalities specific to a given\ncondition - T-wave Alternans (TWA) as a result of Post-Traumatic Stress\nDisorder, or PTSD - and significantly boost performance on a small database of\nrare individuals.\n\nApproach: Using a previously validated artificial ECG model, we generated\n180,000 artificial ECGs with or without significant TWA, with varying heart\nrate, breathing rate, TWA amplitude, and ECG morphology. A DNN, trained on over\n70,000 patients to classify 25 different rhythms, was modified the output layer\nto a binary class (TWA or no-TWA, or equivalently, PTSD or no-PTSD), and\ntransfer learning was performed on the artificial ECG. In a final transfer\nlearning step, the DNN was trained and cross-validated on ECG from 12 PTSD and\n24 controls for all combinations of using the three databases.\n\nMain results: The best performing approach (AUROC = 0.77, Accuracy = 0.72,\nF1-score = 0.64) was found by performing both transfer learning steps, using\nthe pre-trained arrhythmia DNN, the artificial data and the real PTSD-related\nECG data. Removing the artificial data from training led to the largest drop in\nperformance. Removing the arrhythmia data from training provided a modest, but\nsignificant, drop in performance. The final model showed no significant drop in\nperformance on the artificial data, indicating no overfitting.\n\nSignificance: In healthcare, it is common to only have a small collection of\nhigh-quality data and labels, or a larger database with much lower quality (and\nless relevant) labels. The paradigm presented here, involving model-based\nperformance boosting, provides a solution through transfer learning on a large\nrealistic artificial database, and a partially relevant real database.",

          "description": "Designing manufacturing processes with high yield and strong reliability\nrelies on effective methods for rare event estimation. Genealogical importance\nsplitting reduces the variance of rare event probability estimators by\niteratively selecting and replicating realizations that are headed towards a\nrare event. The replication step is difficult when applied to deterministic\nsystems where the initial conditions of the offspring realizations need to be\nmodified. Typically, a random perturbation is applied to the offspring to\ndifferentiate their trajectory from the parent realization. However, this\nrandom perturbation strategy may be effective for some systems while failing\nfor others, preventing variance reduction in the probability estimate. This\nwork seeks to address this limitation using a generative model such as a\nGenerative Adversarial Network (GAN) to generate perturbations that are\nconsistent with the attractor of the dynamical system. The proposed\nGAN-assisted Importance SPlitting method (GANISP) improves the variance\nreduction for the system targeted.

          "description": "In the last decade, many deep learning models have been well trained and made\na great success in various fields of machine intelligence, especially for\ncomputer vision and natural language processing. To better leverage the\npotential of these well-trained models in intra-domain or cross-domain transfer\nlearning situations, knowledge distillation (KD) and domain adaptation (DA) are\nproposed and become research highlights. They both aim to transfer useful\ninformation from a well-trained model with original training data. However, the\noriginal data is not always available in many cases due to privacy, copyright\nor confidentiality. Recently, the data-free knowledge transfer paradigm has\nattracted appealing attention as it deals with distilling valuable knowledge\nfrom well-trained models without requiring to access to the training data. In\nparticular, it mainly consists of the data-free knowledge distillation (DFKD)\nand source data-free domain adaptation (SFDA). On the one hand, DFKD aims to\ntransfer the intra-domain knowledge of original data from a cumbersome teacher\nnetwork to a compact student network for model compression and efficient\ninference. On the other hand, the goal of SFDA is to reuse the cross-domain\nknowledge stored in a well-trained source model and adapt it to a target\ndomain. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive survey on data-free knowledge\ntransfer from the perspectives of knowledge distillation and unsupervised\ndomain adaptation, to help readers have a better understanding of the current\nresearch status and ideas. Applications and challenges of the two areas are\nbriefly reviewed, respectively. Furthermore, we provide some insights to the\nsubject of future research.",

To deal\nwith this complexity, optimization of network parameters is key to ensure high\nperformance and timely adaptivity to dynamic network environments. The\noptimization of the antenna tilt provides a practical and cost-efficient method\nto improve coverage and capacity in the network. Previous methods based on\nReinforcement Learning (RL) have shown great promise for tilt optimization by\nlearning adaptive policies outperforming traditional tilt optimization methods.\nHowever, most existing RL methods are based on single-cell features\nrepresentation, which fails to fully characterize the agent state, resulting in\nsuboptimal performance. Also, most of such methods lack scalability, due to\nstate-action explosion, and generalization ability. In this paper, we propose a\nGraph Attention Q-learning (GAQ) algorithm for tilt optimization. GAQ relies on\na graph attention mechanism to select relevant neighbors information, improve\nthe agent state representation, and update the tilt control policy based on a\nhistory of observations using a Deep Q-Network (DQN). We show that GAQ\nefficiently captures important network information and outperforms standard DQN\nwith local information by a large margin. In addition, we demonstrate its\nability to generalize to network deployments of different sizes and densities.",

An intuitive idea to promote such extrapolation capabilities is\nto have the architecture of such model reflect a causal graph of the true data\ngenerating process, such that one can intervene on each node independently of\nthe others. However, the nodes of this graph are usually unobserved, leading to\noverparameterization and lack of identifiability of the causal structure. We\ndevelop a theoretical framework to address this challenging situation by\ndefining a weaker form of identifiability, based on the principle of\nindependence of mechanisms. We demonstrate on toy examples that classical\nstochastic gradient descent can hinder the model's extrapolation capabilities,\nsuggesting independence of mechanisms should be enforced explicitly during\ntraining. Experiments on deep generative models trained on real world data\nsupport these insights and illustrate how the extrapolation capabilities of\nsuch models can be leveraged.",

Such problems arise, for\nexample, in reinforcement learning, engineering design, and manufacturing.\nWhile the standard Bayesian optimization approach observes only the final\noutput, our approach delivers greater query efficiency by leveraging\ninformation that the former ignores: intermediate output within the network.\nThis is achieved by modeling the nodes of the network using Gaussian processes\nand choosing the points to evaluate using, as our acquisition function, the\nexpected improvement computed with respect to the implied posterior on the\nobjective. Although the non-Gaussian nature of this posterior prevents\ncomputing our acquisition function in closed form, we show that it can be\nefficiently maximized via sample average approximation. In addition, we prove\nthat our method is asymptotically consistent, meaning that it finds a globally\noptimal solution as the number of evaluations grows to infinity, thus\ngeneralizing previously known convergence results for the expected improvement.\nNotably, this holds even though our method might not evaluate the domain\ndensely, instead leveraging problem structure to leave regions unexplored.\nFinally, we show that our approach dramatically outperforms standard Bayesian\noptimization methods in several synthetic and real-world problems.",

Despite the empirical\nsuccesses, it is often neglected that computing meta gradients via vanilla\nbackpropagation is ill-defined. In this paper, we argue that the stochastic\nmeta-gradient estimation adopted by many existing MGRL methods are in fact\nbiased; the bias comes from two sources: 1) the compositional bias that is\ninborn in the structure of compositional optimisation problems and 2) the bias\nof multi-step Hessian estimation caused by direct automatic differentiation. To\nbetter understand the meta gradient biases, we perform the first of its kind\nstudy to quantify the amount for each of them. We start by providing a unifying\nderivation for existing GMRL algorithms, and then theoretically analyse both\nthe bias and the variance of existing gradient estimation methods. On\nunderstanding the underlying principles of bias, we propose two mitigation\nsolutions based on off-policy correction and multi-step Hessian estimation\ntechniques. Comprehensive ablation studies have been conducted and results\nreveals: (1) The existence of these two biases and how they influence the\nmeta-gradient estimation when combined with different estimator/sample\nsize/step and learning rate.

We test different input and output layer\nvariations found in the compared models that are independent of the main\narchitectures of the models, and different maximum attempt count options that\nhave been implicitly and explicitly used in some studies. Several metrics are\nused to reflect on the quality of the evaluated knowledge tracing models.

We\nevaluate logistic regression, Bayesian Knowledge Tracing (BKT) and simple\nnon-learning models as baselines. Our results suggest that the DLKT models in\ngeneral outperform non-DLKT models, and the relative differences between the\nDLKT models are subtle and often vary between datasets. Our results also show\nthat naive models such as mean prediction can yield better performance than\nmore sophisticated knowledge tracing models, especially in terms of accuracy.\nFurther, our metric and hyperparameter analysis shows that the metric used to\nselect the best model hyperparameters has a noticeable effect on the\nperformance of the models, and that metric choice can affect model ranking.

          "description": "Turbulence simulation with classical numerical solvers requires very\nhigh-resolution grids to accurately resolve dynamics. Here we train learned\nsimulators at low spatial and temporal resolutions to capture turbulent\ndynamics generated at high resolution. We show that our proposed model can\nsimulate turbulent dynamics more accurately than classical numerical solvers at\nthe same low resolutions across various scientifically relevant metrics. Our\nmodel is trained end-to-end from data and is capable of learning a range of\nchallenging chaotic and turbulent dynamics at low resolution, including\ntrajectories generated by the state-of-the-art Athena++ engine. We show that\nour simpler, general-purpose architecture outperforms various more specialized,\nturbulence-specific architectures from the learned turbulence simulation\nliterature. In general, we see that learned simulators yield unstable\ntrajectories; however, we show that tuning training noise and temporal\ndownsampling solves this problem. We also find that while generalization beyond\nthe training distribution is a challenge for learned models, training noise,\nconvolutional architectures, and added loss constraints can help. Broadly, we\nconclude that our learned simulator outperforms traditional solvers run on\ncoarser grids, and emphasize that simple design choices can offer stability and\nrobust generalization.",

          "description": "Deep graph clustering, which aims to reveal the underlying graph structure\nand divide the nodes into different groups, has attracted intensive attention\nin recent years. However, we observe that, in the process of node encoding,\nexisting methods suffer from representation collapse which tends to map all\ndata into the same representation. Consequently, the discriminative capability\nof the node representation is limited, leading to unsatisfied clustering\nperformance. To address this issue, we propose a novel self-supervised deep\ngraph clustering method termed Dual Correlation Reduction Network (DCRN) by\nreducing information correlation in a dual manner. Specifically, in our method,\nwe first design a siamese network to encode samples. Then by forcing the\ncross-view sample correlation matrix and cross-view feature correlation matrix\nto approximate two identity matrices, respectively, we reduce the information\ncorrelation in the dual-level, thus improving the discriminative capability of\nthe resulting features. Moreover, in order to alleviate representation collapse\ncaused by over-smoothing in GCN, we introduce a propagation regularization term\nto enable the network to gain long-distance information with the shallow\nnetwork structure. Extensive experimental results on six benchmark datasets\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed DCRN against the existing\nstate-of-the-art methods.",

Detection of\nRhetorical Frames from open sources can help us track the attitudes of\ngovernments or companies towards AI, specifically whether attitudes are\nbecoming more cooperative or competitive over time. Given the rapidly\nincreasing volumes of open sources (online news media, twitter, blogs), it is\ndifficult for subject matter experts to identify Rhetorical Frames in (near)\nreal-time. Moreover, these sources are in general unstructured (noisy) and\ntherefore, detecting Frames from these sources will require state-of-the-art\ntext classification techniques. In this paper, we develop RheFrameDetect, a\ntext classification system for (near) real-time capture of Rhetorical Frames\nfrom open sources. Given an input document, RheFrameDetect employs text\nclassification techniques at multiple levels (document level and paragraph\nlevel) to identify all occurrences of Frames used in the discussion of AI. We\nperformed extensive evaluation of the text classification techniques used in\nRheFrameDetect against human annotated Frames from multiple news sources.

The ability to monitor the\nmask-wearing rate in the population would be useful for determining public\nhealth strategies against the virus. However, artificial intelligence\ntechnologies for detecting face masks have not been deployed at a large scale\nin real-life to measure the mask-wearing rate in public. In this paper, we\npresent a two-step face mask detection approach consisting of two separate\nmodules: 1) face detection and alignment and 2) face mask classification. This\napproach allowed us to experiment with different combinations of face detection\nand face mask classification modules. More specifically, we experimented with\nPyramidKey and RetinaFace as face detectors while maintaining a lightweight\nbackbone for the face mask classification module. Moreover, we also provide a\nrelabeled annotation of the test set of the AIZOO dataset, where we rectified\nthe incorrect labels for some face images. The evaluation results on the AIZOO\nand Moxa 3K datasets showed that the proposed face mask detection pipeline\nsurpassed the state-of-the-art methods. The proposed pipeline also yielded a\nhigher mAP on the relabeled test set of the AIZOO dataset than the original\ntest set.

          "description": "The transformation of conventional power networks into smart grids with the\nheavy penetration level of renewable energy resources, particularly\ngrid-connected Photovoltaic (PV) systems, has increased the need for efficient\nfault identification systems. Malfunctioning any single component in\ngrid-connected PV systems may lead to grid instability and other serious\nconsequences, showing that a reliable fault identification system is the utmost\nrequirement for ensuring operational integrity. Therefore, this paper presents\na novel fault identification approach based on statistical signatures of PV\noperational states. These signatures are unique because each fault has a\ndifferent nature and distinctive impact on the electrical system. Thus, the\nRandom Forest Classifier trained on these extracted signatures showed 100%\naccuracy in identifying all types of faults. Furthermore, the performance\ncomparison of the proposed framework with other Machine Learning classifiers\ndepicts its credibility. Moreover, to elevate user trust in the predicted\noutcomes, SHAP (Shapley Additive Explanation) was utilized during the training\nphase to extract a complete model response (global explanation). This extracted\nglobal explanation can help in the assessment of predicted outcomes credibility\nby decoding each prediction in terms of features contribution. Hence, the\nproposed explainable signature-based fault identification technique is highly\ncredible and fulfills all the requirements of smart grids.",

          "description": "Stochastic and soft optimal policies resulting from entropy-regularized\nMarkov decision processes (ER-MDP) are desirable for exploration and imitation\nlearning applications. Motivated by the fact that such policies are sensitive\nwith respect to the state transition probabilities, and the estimation of these\nprobabilities may be inaccurate, we study a robust version of the ER-MDP model,\nwhere the stochastic optimal policies are required to be robust with respect to\nthe ambiguity in the underlying transition probabilities. Our work is at the\ncrossroads of two important schemes in reinforcement learning (RL), namely,\nrobust MDP and entropy regularized MDP. We show that essential properties that\nhold for the non-robust ER-MDP and robust unregularized MDP models also hold in\nour settings, making the robust ER-MDP problem tractable. We show how our\nframework and results can be integrated into different algorithmic schemes\nincluding value or (modified) policy iteration, which would lead to new robust\nRL and inverse RL algorithms to handle uncertainties.

          "description": "We study the problem of learning a good set of policies, so that when\ncombined together, they can solve a wide variety of unseen reinforcement\nlearning tasks with no or very little new data. Specifically, we consider the\nframework of generalized policy evaluation and improvement, in which the\nrewards for all tasks of interest are assumed to be expressible as a linear\ncombination of a fixed set of features. We show theoretically that, under\ncertain assumptions, having access to a specific set of diverse policies, which\nwe call a set of independent policies, can allow for instantaneously achieving\nhigh-level performance on all possible downstream tasks which are typically\nmore complex than the ones on which the agent was trained. Based on this\ntheoretical analysis, we propose a simple algorithm that iteratively constructs\nthis set of policies. In addition to empirically validating our theoretical\nresults, we compare our approach with recently proposed diverse policy set\nconstruction methods and show that, while others fail, our approach is able to\nbuild a behavior basis that enables instantaneous transfer to all possible\ndownstream tasks. We also show empirically that having access to a set of\nindependent policies can better bootstrap the learning process on downstream\ntasks where the new reward function cannot be described as a linear combination\nof the features. Finally, we demonstrate that this policy set can be useful in\na realistic lifelong reinforcement learning setting.",

          "description": "Support vector machine (SVM) is a powerful classification method that has\nachieved great success in many fields. Since its performance can be seriously\nimpaired by redundant covariates, model selection techniques are widely used\nfor SVM with high dimensional covariates. As an alternative to model selection,\nsignificant progress has been made in the area of model averaging in the past\ndecades. Yet no frequentist model averaging method was considered for SVM. This\nwork aims to fill the gap and to propose a frequentist model averaging\nprocedure for SVM which selects the optimal weight by cross validation. Even\nwhen the number of covariates diverges at an exponential rate of the sample\nsize, we show asymptotic optimality of the proposed method in the sense that\nthe ratio of its hinge loss to the lowest possible loss converges to one. We\nalso derive the convergence rate which provides more insights to model\naveraging. Compared to model selection methods of SVM which require a tedious\nbut critical task of tuning parameter selection, the model averaging method\navoids the task and shows promising performances in the empirical studies.",

The agents can only communicate with\ntheir neighbors in a collaborative effort to solve this problem. In existing\nmethods, multiple rounds of communications are required to guarantee the\nconvergence, giving rise to high communication costs.

In this formulation, the quality of a mapping is evaluated\nsimultaneously with respect to both function content and call graph\nsimilarities. We show that this formulation is equivalent to a network\nalignment problem. We propose a solving strategy for this problem based on\nmax-product belief propagation.

          "description": "Quantizing deep neural networks (DNNs) has been a promising solution for\ndeploying deep neural networks on embedded devices. However, most of the\nexisting methods do not quantize gradients, and the process of quantizing DNNs\nstill has a lot of floating-point operations, which hinders the further\napplications of quantized DNNs. To solve this problem, we propose a new\nheuristic method based on cooperative coevolution for quantizing DNNs. Under\nthe framework of cooperative coevolution, we use the estimation of distribution\nalgorithm to search for the low-bits weights. Specifically, we first construct\nan initial quantized network from a pre-trained network instead of random\ninitialization and then start searching from it by restricting the search\nspace. So far, the problem is the largest discrete problem known to be solved\nby evolutionary algorithms. Experiments show that our method can train 4 bit\nResNet-20 on the Cifar-10 dataset without sacrificing accuracy.",

However, in order for content creators to produce videos with a high\nclick-through rate, much editing is needed to match the footage to the music.\nThis posts additional challenges for more amateur video makers. Therefore, we\npropose a novel attention-based model VMT (Video-Music Transformer) that\nautomatically generates piano scores from video frames. Using music generated\nfrom models also prevent potential copyright infringements that often come with\nusing existing music. To the best of our knowledge, there is no work besides\nthe proposed VMT that aims to compose music for video. Additionally, there\nlacks a dataset with aligned video and symbolic music. We release a new dataset\ncomposed of over 7 hours of piano scores with fine alignment between pop music\nvideos and MIDI files. We conduct experiments with human evaluation on VMT,\nSeqSeq model (our baseline), and the original piano version soundtrack. VMT\nachieves consistent improvements over the baseline on music smoothness and\nvideo relevance. In particular, with the relevance scores and our case study,\nour model has shown the capability of multimodality on frame-level actors'\nmovement for music generation.

          "description": "Image synthesis and image recognition have witnessed remarkable progress, but\noften at the expense of computationally expensive training and inference.\nLearning lightweight yet expressive deep model has emerged as an important and\ninteresting direction. Inspired by the well-known split-transform-aggregate\ndesign heuristic in the Inception building block, this paper proposes a\nSkip-Layer Inception Module (SLIM) that facilitates efficient learning of image\nsynthesis models, and a same-layer variant (dubbed as SLIM too) as a stronger\nalternative to the well-known ResNeXts for image recognition. In SLIM, the\ninput feature map is first split into a number of groups (e.g., 4).Each group\nis then transformed to a latent style vector(via channel-wise attention) and a\nlatent spatial mask (via spatial attention). The learned latent masks and\nlatent style vectors are aggregated to modulate the target feature map. For\ngenerative learning, SLIM is built on a recently proposed lightweight\nGenerative Adversarial Networks (i.e., FastGANs) which present a skip-layer\nexcitation(SLE) module. For few-shot image synthesis tasks, the proposed SLIM\nachieves better performance than the SLE work and other related methods. For\none-shot image synthesis tasks, it shows stronger capability of preserving\nimages structures than prior arts such as the SinGANs. For image classification\ntasks, the proposed SLIM is used as a drop-in replacement for convolution\nlayers in ResNets (resulting in ResNeXt-like models) and achieves better\naccuracy in theImageNet-1000 dataset, with significantly smaller model\ncomplexity",

          "description": "In this thesis, we address the problem of estimating the 6D pose of rigid\nobjects from a single RGB or RGB-D input image, assuming that 3D models of the\nobjects are available. This problem is of great importance to many application\nfields such as robotic manipulation, augmented reality, and autonomous driving.\nFirst, we propose EPOS, a method for 6D object pose estimation from an RGB\nimage. The key idea is to represent an object by compact surface fragments and\npredict the probability distribution of corresponding fragments at each pixel\nof the input image by a neural network. Each pixel is linked with a\ndata-dependent number of fragments, which allows systematic handling of\nsymmetries, and the 6D poses are estimated from the links by a RANSAC-based\nfitting method. EPOS outperformed all RGB and most RGB-D and D methods on\nseveral standard datasets. Second, we present HashMatch, an RGB-D method that\nslides a window over the input image and searches for a match against\ntemplates, which are pre-generated by rendering 3D object models in different\norientations. The method applies a cascade of evaluation stages to each window\nlocation, which avoids exhaustive matching against all templates. Third, we\npropose ObjectSynth, an approach to synthesize photorealistic images of 3D\nobject models for training methods based on neural networks. The images yield\nsubstantial improvements compared to commonly used images of objects rendered\non top of random photographs. Fourth, we introduce T-LESS, the first dataset\nfor 6D object pose estimation that includes 3D models and RGB-D images of\nindustry-relevant objects. Fifth, we define BOP, a benchmark that captures the\nstatus quo in the field. BOP comprises eleven datasets in a unified format, an\nevaluation methodology, an online evaluation system, and public challenges held\nat international workshops organized at the ICCV and ECCV conferences.",

          "description": "In bandits with distribution shifts, one aims to automatically detect an\nunknown number $L$ of changes in reward distribution, and restart exploration\nwhen necessary. While this problem remained open for many years, a recent\nbreakthrough of Auer et al. (2018, 2019) provide the first adaptive procedure\nto guarantee an optimal (dynamic) regret $\\sqrt{LT}$, for $T$ rounds, with no\nknowledge of $L$. However, not all distributional shifts are equally severe,\ne.g., suppose no best arm switches occur, then we cannot rule out that a regret\n$O(\\sqrt{T})$ may remain possible; in other words, is it possible to achieve\ndynamic regret that optimally scales only with an unknown number of severe\nshifts? This unfortunately has remained elusive, despite various attempts (Auer\net al., 2019, Foster et al., 2020).\n\nWe resolve this problem in the case of two-armed bandits: we derive an\nadaptive procedure that guarantees a dynamic regret of order\n$\\tilde{O}(\\sqrt{\\tilde{L} T})$, where $\\tilde L \\ll L$ captures an unknown\nnumber of severe best arm changes, i.e., with significant switches in rewards,\nand which last sufficiently long to actually require a restart. As a\nconsequence, for any number $L$ of distributional shifts outside of these\nsevere shifts, our procedure achieves regret just $\\tilde{O}(\\sqrt{T})\\ll\n\\tilde{O}(\\sqrt{LT})$.\n\nFinally, we note that our notion of severe shift applies in both classical\nsettings of stochastic switching bandits and of adversarial bandits.",

          "description": "Deep reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms are predominantly evaluated by\ncomparing their relative performance on a large suite of tasks. Most published\nresults on deep RL benchmarks compare point estimates of aggregate performance\nsuch as mean and median scores across tasks, ignoring the statistical\nuncertainty implied by the use of a finite number of training runs. Beginning\nwith the Arcade Learning Environment (ALE), the shift towards\ncomputationally-demanding benchmarks has led to the practice of evaluating only\na small number of runs per task, exacerbating the statistical uncertainty in\npoint estimates. In this paper, we argue that reliable evaluation in the few\nrun deep RL regime cannot ignore the uncertainty in results without running the\nrisk of slowing down progress in the field. We illustrate this point using a\ncase study on the Atari 100k benchmark, where we find substantial discrepancies\nbetween conclusions drawn from point estimates alone versus a more thorough\nstatistical analysis. With the aim of increasing the field's confidence in\nreported results with a handful of runs, we advocate for reporting interval\nestimates of aggregate performance and propose performance profiles to account\nfor the variability in results, as well as present more robust and efficient\naggregate metrics, such as interquartile mean scores, to achieve small\nuncertainty in results. Using such statistical tools, we scrutinize performance\nevaluations of existing algorithms on other widely used RL benchmarks including\nthe ALE, Procgen, and the DeepMind Control Suite, again revealing discrepancies\nin prior comparisons. Our findings call for a change in how we evaluate\nperformance in deep RL, for which we present a more rigorous evaluation\nmethodology, accompanied with an open-source library rliable, to prevent\nunreliable results from stagnating the field.",

          "description": "In binary classification, imbalance refers to situations in which one class\nis heavily under-represented. This issue is due to either a data collection\nprocess or because one class is indeed rare in a population. Imbalanced\nclassification frequently arises in applications such as biology, medicine,\nengineering, and social sciences. In this paper, for the first time, we\ntheoretically study the impact of imbalance class sizes on the linear\ndiscriminant analysis (LDA) in high dimensions. We show that due to data\nscarcity in one class, referred to as the minority class, and\nhigh-dimensionality of the feature space, the LDA ignores the minority class\nyielding a maximum misclassification rate. We then propose a new construction\nof hard-thresholding rules based on a data splitting technique that reduces the\nlarge difference between the misclassification rates. We show that the proposed\nmethod is asymptotically optimal. We further study two well-known sparse\nversions of the LDA in imbalanced cases. We evaluate the finite-sample\nperformance of different methods using simulations and by analyzing two real\ndata sets. The results show that our method either outperforms its competitors\nor has comparable performance based on a much smaller subset of selected\nfeatures, while being computationally more efficient.",

Additionally, data space slicing\nallows users to explore the impact of features on both local and global scales.\nFeatureEnVi utilizes multiple automatic feature selection techniques;\nfurthermore, it visually guides users with statistical evidence about the\ninfluence of each feature (or subsets of features). The final outcome is the\nextraction of heavily engineered features, evaluated by multiple validation\nmetrics.

For example, Gaussian graphical models have recently been\nextended to the setting of multivariate functional data by applying\nmultivariate methods to the coefficients of truncated basis expansions.\nHowever, a key difficulty compared to multivariate data is that the covariance\noperator is compact, and thus not invertible. The methodology in this paper\naddresses the general problem of covariance modeling for multivariate\nfunctional data, and functional Gaussian graphical models in particular.

Next, the partial\nseparability structure is shown to be particularly useful in order to provide a\nwell-defined functional Gaussian graphical model that can be identified with a\nsequence of finite-dimensional graphical models, each of identical fixed\ndimension. This motivates a simple and efficient estimation procedure through\napplication of the joint graphical lasso.

          "description": "Neural networks are known to be vulnerable to adversarial attacks -- slight\nbut carefully constructed perturbations of the inputs which can drastically\nimpair the network's performance. Many defense methods have been proposed for\nimproving robustness of deep networks by training them on adversarially\nperturbed inputs. However, these models often remain vulnerable to new types of\nattacks not seen during training, and even to slightly stronger versions of\npreviously seen attacks. In this work, we propose a novel approach to\nadversarial robustness, which builds upon the insights from the domain\nadaptation field. Our method, called Adversarial Feature Desensitization (AFD),\naims at learning features that are invariant towards adversarial perturbations\nof the inputs. This is achieved through a game where we learn features that are\nboth predictive and robust (insensitive to adversarial attacks), i.e. cannot be\nused to discriminate between natural and adversarial data. Empirical results on\nseveral benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach\nagainst a wide range of attack types and attack strengths.

We consider smoothly\nparametrized instances and provide an understanding of when logarithmic regret\nis impossible which is both instance specific and flexible enough to take\nproblem structure into account. This understanding relies on two key notions:\nThat of local-uninformativeness; when the optimal policy does not provide\nsufficient excitation for identification of the optimal policy, and yields a\ndegenerate Fisher information matrix; and that of\ninformation-regret-boundedness, when the small eigenvalues of a\npolicy-dependent information matrix are boundable in terms of the regret of\nthat policy. Combined with a reduction to Bayesian estimation and application\nof Van Trees' inequality, these two conditions are sufficient for proving\nregret bounds on order of magnitude $\\sqrt{T}$ in the time horizon, $T$. This\nmethod yields lower bounds that exhibit tight dimensional dependencies and\nscale naturally with control-theoretic problem constants. For instance, we are\nable to prove that systems operating near marginal stability are fundamentally\nhard to learn to control. We further show that large classes of systems satisfy\nthese conditions, among them any state-feedback system with both $A$- and\n$B$-matrices unknown. Most importantly, we also establish that a nontrivial\nclass of partially observable systems, essentially those that are\nover-actuated, satisfy these conditions, thus providing a $\\sqrt{T}$ lower\nbound also valid for partially observable systems. Finally, we turn to two\nsimple examples which demonstrate that our lower bound captures classical\ncontrol-theoretic intuition: our lower bounds diverge for systems operating\nnear marginal stability or with large filter gain -- these can be arbitrarily\nhard to (learn to) control.",

          "description": "Clinical 12-lead electrocardiography (ECG) is one of the most widely\nencountered kinds of biosignals. Despite the increased availability of public\nECG datasets, label scarcity remains a central challenge in the field.\nSelf-supervised learning represents a promising way to alleviate this issue. In\nthis work, we put forward the first comprehensive assessment of self-supervised\nrepresentation learning from clinical 12-lead ECG data. To this end, we adapt\nstate-of-the-art self-supervised methods based on instance discrimination and\nlatent forecasting to the ECG domain. In a first step, we learn contrastive\nrepresentations and evaluate their quality based on linear evaluation\nperformance on a recently established, comprehensive, clinical ECG\nclassification task. In a second step, we analyze the impact of self-supervised\npretraining on finetuned ECG classifiers as compared to purely supervised\nperformance. For the best-performing method, an adaptation of contrastive\npredictive coding, we find a linear evaluation performance only 0.5% below\nsupervised performance. For the finetuned models, we find improvements in\ndownstream performance of roughly 1% compared to supervised performance, label\nefficiency, as well as robustness against physiological noise. This work\nclearly establishes the feasibility of extracting discriminative\nrepresentations from ECG data via self-supervised learning and the numerous\nadvantages when finetuning such representations on downstream tasks as compared\nto purely supervised training.

          "description": "Kendall transformation is a conversion of an ordered feature into a vector of\npairwise order relations between individual values. This way, it preserves\nranking of observations and represents it in a categorical form.\n\nSuch transformation allows for generalisation of methods requiring strictly\ncategorical input, especially in the limit of small number of observations,\nwhen discretisation becomes problematic. In particular, many approaches of\ninformation theory can be directly applied to Kendall-transformed continuous\ndata without relying on differential entropy or any additional parameters.\nMoreover, by filtering information to this contained in ranking, Kendall\ntransformation leads to a better robustness at a reasonable cost of dropping\nsophisticated interactions which are anyhow unlikely to be correctly estimated.\n\nIn bivariate analysis, Kendall transformation can be related to popular\nnon-parametric methods, showing the soundness of the approach. The paper also\ndemonstrates its efficiency in multivariate problems, as well as provides an\nexample analysis of a real-world data.",

          "description": "We deal with Bayesian generative and discriminative classifiers. Given a\nmodel distribution $p(x, y)$, with the observation $y$ and the target $x$, one\ncomputes generative classifiers by firstly considering $p(x, y)$ and then using\nthe Bayes rule to calculate $p(x | y)$. A discriminative model is directly\ngiven by $p(x | y)$, which is used to compute discriminative classifiers.\nHowever, recent works showed that the Bayesian Maximum Posterior classifier\ndefined from the Naive Bayes (NB) or Hidden Markov Chain (HMC), both generative\nmodels, can also match the discriminative classifier definition. Thus, there\nare situations in which dividing classifiers into \"generative\" and\n\"discriminative\" is somewhat misleading. Indeed, such a distinction is rather\nrelated to the way of computing classifiers, not to the classifiers themselves.\nWe present a general theoretical result specifying how a generative classifier\ninduced from a generative model can also be computed in a discriminative way\nfrom the same model. Examples of NB and HMC are found again as particular\ncases, and we apply the general result to two original extensions of NB, and\ntwo extensions of HMC, one of which being original.

The EMG signals possess a unique characteristic: they\nare inherently different for individuals (biometrics), and they can be\ncustomized to realize multi-length codes or passwords (for example, by\nperforming different gestures). However, current EMG-based biometric research\nhas two critical limitations: 1) a small subject pool, compared to other more\nestablished biometric traits, and 2) limited to single-session or single-day\ndata sets. In this study, forearm and wrist EMG data were collected from 43\nparticipants over three different days with long separation while they\nperformed static hand and wrist gestures. The multi-day biometric\nauthentication resulted in a median EER of 0.017 for the forearm setup and\n0.025 for the wrist setup, comparable to well-established biometric traits\nsuggesting consistent performance over multiple days.

          "description": "Statistical divergences (SDs), which quantify the dissimilarity between\nprobability distributions, are a basic constituent of statistical inference and\nmachine learning. A modern method for estimating those divergences relies on\nparametrizing an empirical variational form by a neural network (NN) and\noptimizing over parameter space. Such neural estimators are abundantly used in\npractice, but corresponding performance guarantees are partial and call for\nfurther exploration. In particular, there is a fundamental tradeoff between the\ntwo sources of error involved: approximation and empirical estimation. While\nthe former needs the NN class to be rich and expressive, the latter relies on\ncontrolling complexity. We explore this tradeoff for an estimator based on a\nshallow NN by means of non-asymptotic error bounds, focusing on four popular\n$\\mathsf{f}$-divergences -- Kullback-Leibler, chi-squared, squared Hellinger,\nand total variation. Our analysis relies on non-asymptotic function\napproximation theorems and tools from empirical process theory. The bounds\nreveal the tension between the NN size and the number of samples, and enable to\ncharacterize scaling rates thereof that ensure consistency. For compactly\nsupported distributions, we further show that neural estimators of the first\nthree divergences above with appropriate NN growth-rate are near minimax\nrate-optimal, achieving the parametric rate up to logarithmic factors.",

To choose a specific\nalgorithm within the class the user must select a balancing function\n$g:\\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}$ satisfying $g(t) = tg(1/t)$, and a noise\ndistribution for the proposal increment. Popular choices within the class are\nthe Metropolis-adjusted Langevin algorithm and the recently introduced Barker\nproposal. We first establish a universal limiting optimal acceptance rate of\n57% and scaling of $n^{-1/3}$ as the dimension $n$ tends to infinity among all\nmembers of the class under mild smoothness assumptions on $g$ and when the\ntarget distribution for the algorithm is of the product form.

We\nderive an optimal choice of noise distribution for the Barker proposal, optimal\nchoice of balancing function under a Gaussian noise distribution, and optimal\nchoice of first-order locally-balanced algorithm among the entire class, which\nturns out to depend on the specific target distribution.

Despite its importance and widespread adoption,\nthere is a noticeable gap between what is considered the state-of-the-art and\nthe methods that are actually used in practice in a variety of fields. Here we\nattempt to address this discrepancy by dividing existing methods according to\nwhether they have a \"descriptive\" or an \"inferential\" goal. While descriptive\nmethods find patterns in networks based on intuitive notions of community\nstructure, inferential methods articulate a precise generative model, and\nattempt to fit it to data. In this way, they are able to provide insights into\nthe mechanisms of network formation, and separate structure from randomness in\na manner supported by statistical evidence. We review how employing descriptive\nmethods with inferential aims is riddled with pitfalls and misleading answers,\nand thus should be in general avoided. We argue that inferential methods are\nmore typically aligned with clearer scientific questions, yield more robust\nresults, and should be in many cases preferred.

          "description": "Running machine learning algorithms on large and rapidly growing volumes of\ndata is often computationally expensive, one common trick to reduce the size of\na data set, and thus reduce the computational cost of machine learning\nalgorithms, is \\emph{probability sampling}. It creates a sampled data set by\nincluding each data point from the original data set with a known probability.\nAlthough the benefit of running machine learning algorithms on the reduced data\nset is obvious, one major concern is that the performance of the solution\nobtained from samples might be much worse than that of the optimal solution\nwhen using the full data set. In this paper, we examine the performance loss\ncaused by probability sampling in the context of adaptive submodular\nmaximization. We consider a simple probability sampling method which selects\neach data point with probability $r\\in[0,1]$. If we set the sampling rate\n$r=1$, our problem reduces to finding a solution based on the original full\ndata set. We define sampling gap as the largest ratio between the optimal\nsolution obtained from the full data set and the optimal solution obtained from\nthe samples, over independence systems. %It captures the performance loss of\nthe optimal solution caused by the probability sampling. Our main contribution\nis to show that if the utility function is policywise submodular, then for a\ngiven sampling rate $r$, the sampling gap is both upper bounded and lower\nbounded by $1/r$. One immediate implication of our result is that if we can\nfind an $\\alpha$-approximation solution based on a sampled data set (which is\nsampled at sampling rate $r$), then this solution achieves an $\\alpha r$\napproximation ratio against the optimal solution when using the full data set.",

          "description": "Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) is a fundamental structure in deep learning.\nRecently, some works study the training process of over-parameterized neural\nnetworks, and show that over-parameterized networks can learn functions in some\nnotable concept classes with a provable generalization error bound. In this\npaper, we analyze the training and generalization for RNNs with random\ninitialization, and provide the following improvements over recent works:\n\n1) For a RNN with input sequence $x=(X_1,X_2,...,X_L)$, previous works study\nto learn functions that are summation of $f(\\beta^T_lX_l)$ and require\nnormalized conditions that $||X_l||\\leq\\epsilon$ with some very small\n$\\epsilon$ depending on the complexity of $f$. In this paper, using detailed\nanalysis about the neural tangent kernel matrix, we prove a generalization\nerror bound to learn such functions without normalized conditions and show that\nsome notable concept classes are learnable with the numbers of iterations and\nsamples scaling almost-polynomially in the input length $L$.\n\n2) Moreover, we prove a novel result to learn N-variables functions of input\nsequence with the form $f(\\beta^T[X_{l_1},...,X_{l_N}])$, which do not belong\nto the \"additive\" concept class, i,e., the summation of function $f(X_l)$. And\nwe show that when either $N$ or $l_0=\\max(l_1,..,l_N)-\\min(l_1,..,l_N)$ is\nsmall, $f(\\beta^T[X_{l_1},...,X_{l_N}])$ will be learnable with the number\niterations and samples scaling almost-polynomially in the input length $L$.",

          "description": "Devising dynamic pricing policy with always valid online statistical learning\nprocedure is an important and as yet unresolved problem. Most existing dynamic\npricing policy, which focus on the faithfulness of adopted customer choice\nmodels, exhibit a limited capability for adapting the online uncertainty of\nlearned statistical model during pricing process. In this paper, we propose a\nnovel approach for designing dynamic pricing policy based regularized online\nstatistical learning with theoretical guarantees. The new approach overcomes\nthe challenge of continuous monitoring of online Lasso procedure and possesses\nseveral appealing properties. In particular, we make the decisive observation\nthat the always-validity of pricing decisions builds and thrives on the online\nregularization scheme. Our proposed online regularization scheme equips the\nproposed optimistic online regularized maximum likelihood pricing (OORMLP)\npricing policy with three major advantages: encode market noise knowledge into\npricing process optimism; empower online statistical learning with\nalways-validity over all decision points; envelop prediction error process with\ntime-uniform non-asymptotic oracle inequalities. This type of non-asymptotic\ninference results allows us to design more sample-efficient and robust dynamic\npricing algorithms in practice. In theory, the proposed OORMLP algorithm\nexploits the sparsity structure of high-dimensional models and secures a\nlogarithmic regret in a decision horizon. These theoretical advances are made\npossible by proposing an optimistic online Lasso procedure that resolves\ndynamic pricing problems at the process level, based on a novel use of\nnon-asymptotic martingale concentration. In experiments, we evaluate OORMLP in\ndifferent synthetic and real pricing problem settings, and demonstrate that\nOORMLP advances the state-of-the-art methods.",

To use conditional SI framework, it is\nnecessary to characterize the events of how the robust method identifies\noutliers. Unfortunately, the existing methods cannot be directly used here\nbecause they are applicable to the case where the selection events can be\nrepresented by linear/quadratic constraints.

          "description": "Classification of malware families is crucial for a comprehensive\nunderstanding of how they can infect devices, computers, or systems. Thus,\nmalware identification enables security researchers and incident responders to\ntake precautions against malware and accelerate mitigation. API call sequences\nmade by malware are widely utilized features by machine and deep learning\nmodels for malware classification as these sequences represent the behavior of\nmalware. However, traditional machine and deep learning models remain incapable\nof capturing sequence relationships between API calls. On the other hand, the\ntransformer-based models process sequences as a whole and learn relationships\nbetween API calls due to multi-head attention mechanisms and positional\nembeddings. Our experiments demonstrate that the transformer model with one\ntransformer block layer surpassed the widely used base architecture, LSTM.\nMoreover, BERT or CANINE, pre-trained transformer models, outperformed in\nclassifying highly imbalanced malware families according to evaluation metrics,\nF1-score, and AUC score. Furthermore, the proposed bagging-based random\ntransformer forest (RTF), an ensemble of BERT or CANINE, has reached the\nstate-of-the-art evaluation scores on three out of four datasets, particularly\nstate-of-the-art F1-score of 0.6149 on one of the commonly used benchmark\ndataset.",

          "description": "We aim to provably complete a sparse and highly-missing tensor in the\npresence of covariate information along tensor modes. Our motivation comes from\nonline advertising where users click-through-rates (CTR) on ads over various\ndevices form a CTR tensor that has about 96% missing entries and has many zeros\non non-missing entries, which makes the standalone tensor completion method\nunsatisfactory. Beside the CTR tensor, additional ad features or user\ncharacteristics are often available. In this paper, we propose\nCovariate-assisted Sparse Tensor Completion (COSTCO) to incorporate covariate\ninformation for the recovery of the sparse tensor. The key idea is to jointly\nextract latent components from both the tensor and the covariate matrix to\nlearn a synthetic representation. Theoretically, we derive the error bound for\nthe recovered tensor components and explicitly quantify the improvements on\nboth the reveal probability condition and the tensor recovery accuracy due to\ncovariates. Finally, we apply COSTCO to an advertisement dataset consisting of\na CTR tensor and ad covariate matrix, leading to 23% accuracy improvement over\nthe baseline. An important by-product is that ad latent components from COSTCO\nreveal interesting ad clusters, which are useful for better ad targeting.",

The gate can be trained using first-order\nmethods, such as stochastic gradient descent, and offers explicit control over\nthe number of experts to select. We demonstrate the effectiveness of DSelect-k\non both synthetic and real MTL datasets with up to $128$ tasks.

Specifically, we\nconsider two such estimands: (a) the average treatment effect and (b) the\nquantile treatment effect, as prototype cases, in an SS setting, characterized\nby two available data sets: (i) a labeled data set of size $n$, providing\nobservations for a response and a set of high dimensional covariates, as well\nas a binary treatment indicator; and (ii) an unlabeled data set of size $N$,\nmuch larger than $n$, but without the response observed. Using these two data\nsets, we develop a family of SS estimators which are ensured to be: (1) more\nrobust and (2) more efficient than their supervised counterparts based on the\nlabeled data set only. Beyond the 'standard' double robustness results (in\nterms of consistency) that can be achieved by supervised methods as well, we\nfurther establish root-n consistency and asymptotic normality of our SS\nestimators whenever the propensity score in the model is correctly specified,\nwithout requiring specific forms of the nuisance functions involved. Such an\nimprovement of robustness arises from the use of the massive unlabeled data, so\nit is generally not attainable in a purely supervised setting. In addition, our\nestimators are shown to be semi-parametrically efficient as long as all the\nnuisance functions are correctly specified. Moreover, as an illustration of the\nnuisance estimators, we consider inverse-probability-weighting type kernel\nsmoothing estimators involving unknown covariate transformation mechanisms, and\nestablish in high dimensional scenarios novel results on their uniform\nconvergence rates, which should be of independent interest.

The definition of MER provides a principled way to define different\nnotions of uncertainties in Bayesian learning, including the aleatoric\nuncertainty and the minimum epistemic uncertainty. Two methods for deriving\nupper bounds for the MER are presented. The first method, generally suitable\nfor Bayesian learning with a parametric generative model, upper-bounds the MER\nby the conditional mutual information between the model parameters and the\nquantity being predicted given the observed data. It allows us to quantify the\nrate at which the MER decays to zero as more data becomes available. Under\nrealizable models, this method also relates the MER to the richness of the\ngenerative function class, notably the VC dimension in binary classification.\nThe second method, particularly suitable for Bayesian learning with a\nparametric predictive model, relates the MER to the minimum estimation error of\nthe model parameters from data.

However, the topological, statistical, and computational consequences\nof this technique have not yet been well-established. In this paper, we aim at\nbridging this gap and derive various theoretical properties of sliced\nprobability divergences. First, we show that slicing preserves the metric\naxioms and the weak continuity of the divergence, implying that the sliced\ndivergence will share similar topological properties. We then precise the\nresults in the case where the base divergence belongs to the class of integral\nprobability metrics.

          "description": "As machine learning powered decision making is playing an increasingly\nimportant role in our daily lives, it is imperative to strive for fairness of\nthe underlying data processing and algorithms. We propose a pre-processing\nalgorithm for fair data representation via which L2- objective supervised\nlearning algorithms result in an estimation of the Pareto frontier between\nprediction error and statistical disparity. In particular, the present work\napplies the optimal positive definite affine transport maps to approach the\npost-processing Wasserstein barycenter characterization of the optimal fair\nL2-objective supervised learning via a pre-processing data deformation. We call\nthe resulting data Wasserstein pseudo-barycenter. Furthermore, we show that the\nWasserstein geodesics from the learning outcome marginals to the barycenter\ncharacterizes the Pareto frontier between L2-loss and total Wasserstein\ndistance among learning outcome marginals. Thereby, an application of McCann\ninterpolation generalizes the pseudo-barycenter to a family of data\nrepresentations via which L2-objective supervised learning algorithms result in\nthe Pareto frontier. Numerical simulations underscore the advantages of the\nproposed data representation: (1) the pre-processing step is compositive with\narbitrary L2-objective supervised learning methods and unseen data; (2) the\nfair representation protects data privacy by preventing the training machine\nfrom direct or indirect access to the sensitive information of the data; (3)\nthe optimal affine map results in efficient computation of fair supervised\nlearning on high-dimensional data; (4) experimental results shed light on the\nfairness of L2-objective unsupervised learning via the proposed fair data\nrepresentation.",

By\nviewing the actor-critic RL from the perspective of variational inference (VI),\nthe policy network is trained to obtain the approximate posterior of actions\ngiven the optimality criteria. However, in practice, the actor-critic RL may\nyield suboptimal policy estimates due to the amortization gap and insufficient\nexploration. In this work, inspired by the previous use of Hamiltonian Monte\nCarlo (HMC) in VI, we propose to integrate the policy network of actor-critic\nRL with HMC, which is termed as {\\it Hamiltonian Policy}. As such we propose to\nevolve actions from the base policy according to HMC, and our proposed method\nhas many benefits. First, HMC can improve the policy distribution to better\napproximate the posterior and hence reduce the amortization gap. Second, HMC\ncan also guide the exploration more to the regions of action spaces with higher\nQ values, enhancing the exploration efficiency. Further, instead of directly\napplying HMC into RL, we propose a new leapfrog operator to simulate the\nHamiltonian dynamics. Finally, in safe RL problems, we find that the proposed\nmethod can not only improve the achieved return, but also reduce safety\nconstraint violations by discarding potentially unsafe actions. With\ncomprehensive empirical experiments on continuous control baselines, including\nMuJoCo and PyBullet Roboschool, we show that the proposed approach is a\ndata-efficient and easy-to-implement improvement over previous actor-critic\nmethods.",

Numerical upscaling methods have been proven to\nbe effective and robust for coarsening geologic models, but their efficiency\nremains to be improved. In this work, a deep-learning-based method is proposed\nto upscale the fine-scale geologic models, which can assist to improve\nupscaling efficiency significantly. In the deep learning method, a deep\nconvolutional neural network (CNN) is trained to approximate the relationship\nbetween the coarse grid of hydraulic conductivity fields and the hydraulic\nheads, which can then be utilized to replace the numerical solvers while\nsolving the flow equations for each coarse block. In addition, physical laws\n(e.g., governing equations and periodic boundary conditions) can also be\nincorporated into the training process of the deep CNN model, which is termed\nthe theory-guided convolutional neural network (TgCNN). With the physical\ninformation considered, dependence on the data volume of training the deep\nlearning models can be reduced greatly. Several subsurface flow cases are\nintroduced to test the performance of the proposed deep-learning-based\nupscaling method, including 2D and 3D cases, and isotropic and anisotropic\ncases. The results show that the deep learning method can provide equivalent\nupscaling accuracy to the numerical method, and efficiency can be improved\nsignificantly compared to numerical upscaling.",

However, standard RL\nalgorithms can only be applied for single reward function, and cannot adapt to\nan unseen reward function quickly. In this paper, we advocate a general\noperator view of reinforcement learning, which enables us to directly\napproximate the operator that maps from reward function to value function. The\nbenefit of learning the operator is that we can incorporate any new reward\nfunction as input and attain its corresponding value function in a zero-shot\nmanner. To approximate this special type of operator, we design a number of\nnovel operator neural network architectures based on its theoretical\nproperties. Our design of operator networks outperform the existing methods and\nthe standard design of general purpose operator network, and we demonstrate the\nbenefit of our operator deep Q-learning framework in several tasks including\nreward transferring for offline policy evaluation (OPE) and reward transferring\nfor offline policy optimization in a range of tasks.",

However, the nodes of this graph are usually unobserved, leading to\noverparameterization and lack of identifiability of the causal structure.

SGMs rely on a diffusion process that gradually perturbs the data\ntowards a tractable distribution, while the generative model learns to denoise.\nThe complexity of this denoising task is, apart from the data distribution\nitself, uniquely determined by the diffusion process. We argue that current\nSGMs employ overly simplistic diffusions, leading to unnecessarily complex\ndenoising processes, which limit generative modeling performance. Based on\nconnections to statistical mechanics, we propose a novel critically-damped\nLangevin diffusion (CLD) and show that CLD-based SGMs achieve superior\nperformance. CLD can be interpreted as running a joint diffusion in an extended\nspace, where the auxiliary variables can be considered \"velocities\" that are\ncoupled to the data variables as in Hamiltonian dynamics. We derive a novel\nscore matching objective for CLD and show that the model only needs to learn\nthe score function of the conditional distribution of the velocity given data,\nan easier task than learning scores of the data directly. We also derive a new\nsampling scheme for efficient synthesis from CLD-based diffusion models. We\nfind that CLD outperforms previous SGMs in synthesis quality for similar\nnetwork architectures and sampling compute budgets. We show that our novel\nsampler for CLD significantly outperforms solvers such as Euler--Maruyama.

In the\nplanning phase, the agent is given a specific reward function and uses samples\ncollected from the exploration phase to learn a good policy. We propose a new\nprovably efficient algorithm, called UCRL-RFE under the Linear Mixture MDP\nassumption, where the transition probability kernel of the MDP can be\nparameterized by a linear function over certain feature mappings defined on the\ntriplet of state, action, and next state.

          "description": "A/B testing, or online experiment is a standard business strategy to compare\na new product with an old one in pharmaceutical, technological, and traditional\nindustries. Major challenges arise in online experiments of two-sided\nmarketplace platforms (e.g., Uber) where there is only one unit that receives a\nsequence of treatments over time. In those experiments, the treatment at a\ngiven time impacts current outcome as well as future outcomes. The aim of this\npaper is to introduce a reinforcement learning framework for carrying A/B\ntesting in these experiments, while characterizing the long-term treatment\neffects. Our proposed testing procedure allows for sequential monitoring and\nonline updating. It is generally applicable to a variety of treatment designs\nin different industries. In addition, we systematically investigate the\ntheoretical properties (e.g., size and power) of our testing procedure.\nFinally, we apply our framework to both simulated data and a real-world data\nexample obtained from a technological company to illustrate its advantage over\nthe current practice. A Python implementation of our test is available at\nhttps://github.com/callmespring/CausalRL.",

          "description": "Recent advances in machine learning have largely benefited from the massive\naccessible training data. However, large-scale data sharing has raised great\nprivacy concerns. In this work, we propose a novel privacy-preserving data\nGenerative model based on the PATE framework (G-PATE), aiming to train a\nscalable differentially private data generator that preserves high generated\ndata utility. Our approach leverages generative adversarial nets to generate\ndata, combined with private aggregation among different discriminators to\nensure strong privacy guarantees. Compared to existing approaches, G-PATE\nsignificantly improves the use of privacy budgets. In particular, we train a\nstudent data generator with an ensemble of teacher discriminators and propose a\nnovel private gradient aggregation mechanism to ensure differential privacy on\nall information that flows from teacher discriminators to the student\ngenerator. In addition, with random projection and gradient discretization, the\nproposed gradient aggregation mechanism is able to effectively deal with\nhigh-dimensional gradient vectors. Theoretically, we prove that G-PATE ensures\ndifferential privacy for the data generator. Empirically, we demonstrate the\nsuperiority of G-PATE over prior work through extensive experiments. We show\nthat G-PATE is the first work being able to generate high-dimensional image\ndata with high data utility under limited privacy budgets ($\\epsilon \\le 1$).\nOur code is available at https://github.com/AI-secure/G-PATE.",

          "description": "Adversarial training is so far the most effective strategy in defending\nagainst adversarial examples. However, it suffers from high computational costs\ndue to the iterative adversarial attacks in each training step. Recent studies\nshow that it is possible to achieve fast Adversarial Training by performing a\nsingle-step attack with random initialization. However, such an approach still\nlags behind state-of-the-art adversarial training algorithms on both stability\nand model robustness. In this work, we develop a new understanding towards Fast\nAdversarial Training, by viewing random initialization as performing randomized\nsmoothing for better optimization of the inner maximization problem. Following\nthis new perspective, we also propose a new initialization strategy, backward\nsmoothing, to further improve the stability and model robustness over\nsingle-step robust training methods. Experiments on multiple benchmarks\ndemonstrate that our method achieves similar model robustness as the original\nTRADES method while using much less training time ($\\sim$3x improvement with\nthe same training schedule).",

The setting consists of a stochastic\ndifferential equation that captures the state evolution of the plant\nunderstudy, while the true dynamics matrices are unknown and need to be learned\nfrom the observed data of state trajectory. An important issue is to ensure\nthat the system is stabilized and destabilizing control actions due to model\nuncertainties are precluded as soon as possible.

The agents can only communicate with\ntheir neighbors in a collaborative effort to solve this problem.

          "description": "\"Benign overfitting\", where classifiers memorize noisy training data yet\nstill achieve a good generalization performance, has drawn great attention in\nthe machine learning community. To explain this surprising phenomenon, a series\nof works have provided theoretical justification in over-parameterized linear\nregression, classification, and kernel methods. However, it is not clear if\nbenign overfitting still occurs in the presence of adversarial examples, i.e.,\nexamples with tiny and intentional perturbations to fool the classifiers. In\nthis paper, we show that benign overfitting indeed occurs in adversarial\ntraining, a principled approach to defend against adversarial examples. In\ndetail, we prove the risk bounds of the adversarially trained linear classifier\non the mixture of sub-Gaussian data under $\\ell_p$ adversarial perturbations.\nOur result suggests that under moderate perturbations, adversarially trained\nlinear classifiers can achieve the near-optimal standard and adversarial risks,\ndespite overfitting the noisy training data.

          "description": "Tree-based algorithms such as random forests and gradient boosted trees\ncontinue to be among the most popular and powerful machine learning models used\nacross multiple disciplines. The conventional wisdom of estimating the impact\nof a feature in tree based models is to measure the \\textit{node-wise reduction\nof a loss function}, which (i) yields only global importance measures and (ii)\nis known to suffer from severe biases. Conditional feature contributions (CFCs)\nprovide \\textit{local}, case-by-case explanations of a prediction by following\nthe decision path and attributing changes in the expected output of the model\nto each feature along the path. However, Lundberg et al. pointed out a\npotential bias of CFCs which depends on the distance from the root of a tree.\nThe by now immensely popular alternative, SHapley Additive exPlanation (SHAP)\nvalues appear to mitigate this bias but are computationally much more\nexpensive. Here we contribute a thorough comparison of the explanations\ncomputed by both methods on a set of 164 publicly available classification\nproblems in order to provide data-driven algorithm recommendations to current\nresearchers. For random forests, we find extremely high similarities and\ncorrelations of both local and global SHAP values and CFC scores, leading to\nvery similar rankings and interpretations.

          "description": "The effectiveness of traditional traffic prediction methods is often\nextremely limited when forecasting traffic dynamics in early morning. The\nreason is that traffic can break down drastically during the early morning\ncommute, and the time and duration of this break-down vary substantially from\nday to day. Early morning traffic forecast is crucial to inform morning-commute\ntraffic management, but they are generally challenging to predict in advance,\nparticularly by midnight. In this paper, we propose to mine Twitter messages as\na probing method to understand the impacts of people's work and rest patterns\nin the evening/midnight of the previous day to the next-day morning traffic.\nThe model is tested on freeway networks in Pittsburgh as experiments. The\nresulting relationship is surprisingly simple and powerful. We find that, in\ngeneral, the earlier people rest as indicated from Tweets, the more congested\nroads will be in the next morning. The occurrence of big events in the evening\nbefore, represented by higher or lower tweet sentiment than normal, often\nimplies lower travel demand in the next morning than normal days. Besides,\npeople's tweeting activities in the night before and early morning are\nstatistically associated with congestion in morning peak hours. We make use of\nsuch relationships to build a predictive framework which forecasts morning\ncommute congestion using people's tweeting profiles extracted by 5 am or as\nlate as the midnight prior to the morning. The Pittsburgh study supports that\nour framework can precisely predict morning congestion, particularly for some\nroad segments upstream of roadway bottlenecks with large day-to-day congestion\nvariation. Our approach considerably outperforms those existing methods without\nTwitter message features, and it can learn meaningful representation of demand\nfrom tweeting profiles that offer managerial insights.",

LARS is known to produce a piecewise affine solution path with change\npoints referred to as the knots of the LARS path. The key to our results is an\nexpression in closed form of the exact joint law of a $K$-tuple of knots\nconditional on the variables selected by LARS, namely the so-called\npost-selection joint law of the LARS knots. Numerical experiments demonstrate\nthe perfect fit of our findings.\n\nThis paper makes three main contributions. First, we build testing procedures\non variables entering the model along the LARS path in the general design case\nwhen the noise level can be unknown. These testing procedures are referred to\nas the Generalized $t$-Spacing tests (GtSt) and we prove that they have an\nexact non-asymptotic level (i.e., the Type I error is exactly controlled). This\nextends work of (Taylor et al., 2014) where the spacing test works for\nconsecutive knots and known variance. Second, we introduce a new exact multiple\nfalse negatives test after model selection in the general design case when the\nnoise level may be unknown. We prove that this testing procedure has exact\nnon-asymptotic level for general design and unknown noise level. Third, we give\nan exact control of the false discovery rate under orthogonal design\nassumption.

          "description": "The gradient noise of Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) is considered to play\na key role in its properties (e.g. escaping low potential points and\nregularization). Past research has indicated that the covariance of the SGD\nerror done via minibatching plays a critical role in determining its\nregularization and escape from low potential points. It is however not much\nexplored how much the distribution of the error influences the behavior of the\nalgorithm. Motivated by some new research in this area, we prove universality\nresults by showing that noise classes that have the same mean and covariance\nstructure of SGD via minibatching have similar properties. We mainly consider\nthe Multiplicative Stochastic Gradient Descent (M-SGD) algorithm as introduced\nby Wu et al., which has a much more general noise class than the SGD algorithm\ndone via minibatching. We establish nonasymptotic bounds for the M-SGD\nalgorithm mainly with respect to the Stochastic Differential Equation\ncorresponding to SGD via minibatching. We also show that the M-SGD error is\napproximately a scaled Gaussian distribution with mean $0$ at any fixed point\nof the M-SGD algorithm. We also establish bounds for the convergence of the\nM-SGD algorithm in the strongly convex regime.",

          "description": "Approximate message passing (AMP) is a promising technique for unknown signal\nreconstruction of certain high-dimensional linear systems with non-Gaussian\nsignaling. A distinguished feature of the AMP-type algorithms is that their\ndynamics can be rigorously described by state evolution. However, state\nevolution does not necessarily guarantee the convergence of iterative\nalgorithms. To solve the convergence problem of AMP-type algorithms in\nprinciple, this paper proposes a memory AMP (MAMP) under a sufficient statistic\ncondition, named sufficient statistic MAMP (SS-MAMP). We show that the\ncovariance matrices of SS-MAMP are L-banded and convergent. Given an arbitrary\nMAMP, we can construct an SS-MAMP by damping, which not only ensures the\nconvergence of MAMP but also preserves the orthogonality of MAMP, i.e., its\ndynamics can be rigorously described by state evolution. As a byproduct, we\nprove that the Bayes-optimal orthogonal/vector AMP (BO-OAMP/VAMP) is an\nSS-MAMP. As a result, we reveal two interesting properties of BO-OAMP/VAMP for\nlarge systems: 1) the covariance matrices are L-banded and are convergent in\nBO-OAMP/VAMP, and 2) damping and memory are useless (i.e., do not bring\nperformance improvement) in BO-OAMP/VAMP. As an example, we construct a\nsufficient statistic Bayes-optimal MAMP (BO-MAMP), which is Bayes optimal if\nits state evolution has a unique fixed point and its MSE is not worse than the\noriginal BO-MAMP. Finally, simulations are provided to verify the validity and\naccuracy of the theoretical results.",

          "description": "Information-theoretic measures have been widely adopted in the design of\nfeatures for learning and decision problems.

We present several results that shed light on this\ninterplay. Our first result offers a lower bound on a weak form of information\nloss as a function of its respective operation loss when adopting a discrete\nlossy representation (quantization) instead of the original raw observation.\nFrom this, our main result shows that a specific form of vanishing information\nloss (a weak notion of asymptotic informational sufficiency) implies a\nvanishing MPE loss (or asymptotic operational sufficiency) when considering a\ngeneral family of lossy continuous representations. Our theoretical findings\nsupport the observation that the selection of feature representations that\nattempt to capture informational sufficiency is appropriate for learning, but\nthis selection is a rather conservative design principle if the intended goal\nis achieving MPE in classification. Supporting this last point, and under some\nstructural conditions, we show that it is possible to adopt an alternative\nnotion of informational sufficiency (strictly weaker than pure sufficiency in\nthe mutual information sense) to achieve operational sufficiency in learning.",

Sparsest cut is often billed as a \"graph clustering\" algorithm. \n Sparsest cut gives rise to an obvious data clustering algorithm: build a graph on your data (like kNN or threshold graph), and run sparsest cut to get a 2-way partition. To do a k-way partition, you could recursively do this. From what I know, sparsest cut intuition is one thing that guided the creation of spectral clustering, a widely used clustering method. \n HHas anyone tried implementing this in practice? If so, how does it do on data? If not, why not? I have searched extensively on Google for any implementations of this sparsest-cut style clustering, but I haven't found any. Given that sparsest cut is one of the most well-studied problems in computer theory, I was surprised that no implementation of this clustering method exists.\n    submitted by    /u/Grand_Distribution83  \n [link]   [comments]",

Some of the talks are going to be by ML teams at companies like AppsFlyer and BigPanda, explaining how they built their internal stacks and ML systems.\n There's also a super interesting talk by the NVIDIA team, where they will talk about building supercomputers to train ML models on them. This one seems crazy awesome to me.\n It's also a good opportunity to listen to offerings by some cool ML startups, which might give you a better understanding of how they compare, and what you actually care about when choosing MLOps tools.\n The organizers will probably be here in the comments if you have any questions, but in my opinion, every event this community organizes is really awesome, and I get to learn a lot, so I really recommend this.\n    submitted by    /u/PhYsIcS-GUY227  \n [link]   [comments]",

Transformers this, Transformers that, and over here a bonfire worth of GPU-TPU-neuromorphic wafer scale sil- icon. We opt for the lazy path of old and proven techniques with a fancy crypto1 inspired acronym: the Single Headed Attention RNN (SHA-RNN). The author’s lone goal is to show that the entire field might have evolved a different direction if we had instead been obsessed with a slightly differ- ent acronym and slightly different result. We take a previously strong language model based only on boring LSTMs and get it to within a stone’s throw of a stone’s throw of state-of-the-art byte level language model results on enwik8. This work has undergone no intensive hyperparameter optimization and lived entirely on a commodity desktop machine that made the author’s small stu- dio apartment far too warm in the midst of a San Franciscan summer2 . The final results are achiev- able in plus or minus 24 hours on a single GPU as the author is impatient. The attention mechanism is also readily extended to large contexts with minimal computation. Take that Sesame Street.\n  \nhttps://arxiv.org/abs/1911.11423\n    submitted by    /u/Puzzled-Bite-8467  \n [link]   [comments]",

Currently, it can use numpy arrays, pandas dataframes and Ray Data Datasets.\n pip install ray-skorch\n You can switch your skorch code to ray-skorch just by changing a few lines:\n import numpy as np from sklearn.datasets import make_classification from torch import nn # pip install pytorch_tabnet from pytorch_tabnet.tab_network import TabNet from ray_skorch import RayTrainNeuralNet X, y = make_classification(1000, 20, n_informative=10, random_state=0) X = X.astype(np.float32) y = y.astype(np.int64) net = RayTrainNeuralNet( TabNet, num_workers=2, # the only new mandatory argument criterion=nn.CrossEntropyLoss, max_epochs=10, lr=0.1, # TabNet specific arguments module__input_dim=20, module__output_dim=2, # required for classification loss funcs iterator_train__unsqueeze_label_tensor=False, iterator_valid__unsqueeze_label_tensor=False, ) net.fit(X, y) # predict_proba returns a ray.data.Dataset y_proba = net.predict_proba(X).to_pandas() \n More examples, including ones on bigger datasets, can be found here - https://github.com/Yard1/ray-skorch/tree/main/examples\n The package is experimental, and I’d love to hear your feedback - both on the package itself and on the concept of distributed training on tabular data with simple, familiar APIs.

I’m one of the creators of Sieve, and I’m excited to be sharing it!\n Sieve is an API that helps you store, process, and automatically search your video data–instantly and efficiently. Just think 10 cameras recording footage at 30 FPS, 24/7. That would be 27 million frames generated in a single day. The videos might be searchable by timestamp, but finding moments of interest is like searching for a needle in a haystack.\n We built this visual demo (link here) a little while back which we’d love to get feedback on. It’s ~24 hours of security footage that our API processed in <10 mins and has simple querying and export functionality enabled. We see applications in better understanding what data you have, figuring out which data to send to labeling, sampling datasets for training, and building multiple test sets for models by scenario.\n To try it on your videos: https://github.com/Sieve-Data/automatic-video-processing\n Visual dashboard walkthrough: https://youtu.be/_uyjp_HGZl4\n https://preview.redd.it/bn8hoqoa1m981.png?width=2540&format=png&auto=webp&s=25fb08037438593291fecf7e50ca58ec1f9bea72\n https://preview.redd.it/jwkd7uoa1m981.png?width=2540&format=png&auto=webp&s=e25382b4b09855e5934608754a8b74bdbaf93204\n https://preview.redd.it/0dd74toa1m981.png?width=2540&format=png&auto=webp&s=05b7625195947b8f15891a9019070efa3730b336\n https://preview.redd.it/alg4ruoa1m981.png?width=2540&format=png&auto=webp&s=f5caad143b0d23f3add08f431d0ada322ae4e84d\n https://preview.redd.it/8c2pw0pa1m981.png?width=2540&format=png&auto=webp&s=e6438f03e3fc7a00ccdf01c9b7075b9e8752affd\n    submitted by    /u/happybirthday290  \n [link]   [comments]",

The approach is based on first-order logic and Herbrand semantics, taking the first steps toward the computing power of a universal Turing machine. The approach can take advantage of logical structures appearing in natural language, to learn rules that represent how actions and consequences are related in the real world. The outcome is a logic program of Horn clauses, bringing in a structured view of unstructured data. In closed-domain question-answering, the first-order representation produces 10× more compact knowledge bases, along with an increase in answering accuracy from 94.83% to 99.48%. The approach is further robust towards erroneous, missing, and superfluous information, distilling the aspects of a text that are important for real-world understanding. https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10844-021-00682-5 #ML #AI #NLP #MachineLearning #Logic #Relational\n    submitted by    /u/olegranmo  \n [link]   [comments]",

As to my submission (5568), I run extra experiments and answered each of the concerns directly but received 0 feedback from the reviewers.\n As a reviewer, I think it doesn't matter if the rebuttal changes your mind about the quality of the submission but it's very basic manner to reply to the authors' responses. A simple \"Thank the authors for the responses but I don't think these addressed my concerns\" would work. Saying nothing only means you are uncertain if the responses make sense and you just doesn't care to figure it out. The authors spent a whole week running experiments to answer some of your questions and if you don't give **** about their responses, just keep the questions with you and don't submit your review.\n I was hoping for a different experience submitting to ICLR and then I realized the \"discussion\" is basically broken.\n    submitted by    /u/MLPRulesAll  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "My job is to work with ML engineers and provide them with whatever they need to experiment with/train/test/deploy ML models -- GPU infrastructure, distributed training support, etc. When I interface with their code, I almost always find it so poorly written, with little to no thought given to long-term stability or use -- for code that they 100% know is going to production.\n They're brilliant people, far smarter than me, and really good at what they do, so it's not a matter of them not being good enough. I feel (from my very limited experience, so I'm happy to be wrong) like ML engineers are incentivized to write poor code. The only metric for evaluation seems to be accuracy, loss, and all the plots that come up. In research, I understand completely, that's where the focus lies, but in industry? I've seen many models perform poorly because the code is so hard to read and refactor that big issues remained unspotted for months together. And this is especially befuddling because for a field that is completely fine with spending months to get an ROI of single digit increases in model performance metrics during the experimentation phase, they don't seem to care about anything that might go wrong in production. That just feels like a fundamental disconnect, since without the core ML stuff working perfectly, none of the other stuff (like what I do) has any value -- and even so, I'm taught to hold my code to a much higher standard than the critical stuff -- which I'm happy about since I can now write production code by default -- but it's just... weird.

          "description": "Discussion: Discussion Thread for comments, corrections, or any feedback. Summary: The latest batch of language models can be much smaller yet achieve GPT-3 like performance by being able to query a database or search the web for information. A key indication is that building larger and larger models is not the only way to improve performance. The last few years saw the rise of Large Language Models (LLMs) – machine learning models that rapidly improve how machines process and generate language. Some of the highlights since 2017 include: The original Transformer breaks previous performance records for machine translation. BERT popularizes the pre-training then finetuning process, as well as Transformer-based contextualized word embeddings. It then rapidly starts to power Google Search and Bing Search. GPT-2 demonstrates the machine’s ability to write as well as humans do. First T5, then T0 push the boundaries of transfer learning (training a model on one task, and then having it do well on other adjacent tasks) and posing a lot of different tasks as text-to-text tasks. GPT-3 showed that massive scaling of generative models can lead to shocking emergent applications (the industry continues to train larger models like Gopher, MT-NLG…etc). For a while, it seemed like scaling larger and larger models is the main way to improve performance. Recent developments in the field, like DeepMind’s RETRO Transformer and OpenAI’s WebGPT, reverse this trend by showing that smaller generative language models can perform on par with massive models if we augment them with a way to search/query for information. This article breaks down DeepMind’s RETRO (Retrieval-Enhanced TRansfOrmer) and how it works. The model performs on par with GPT-3 despite being 4% its size (7.5 billion parameters vs. 185 billion for GPT-3 Da Vinci). RETRO incorporates information retrieved from a database to free its parameters from being an expensive store of facts and world knowledge. RETRO was presented in the paper Improving Language Models by Retrieving from Trillions of Tokens. It continues and builds on a wide variety of retrieval work in the research community. This article explains the model and not what is especially novel about it.",

We’ve seen over the last five years that, when provided with an extrinsic reward function, RL agents can master very complex tasks like playing Go, Starcraft, and dextrous robotic manipulation. While large-scale RL agents can achieve stunning results, even the best RL agents today are narrow. Most RL algorithms today can only solve the single task they were trained on and do not exhibit cross-task or cross-domain generalization capabilities.\nA side-effect of the narrowness of today’s RL systems is that today’s RL agents are also very data inefficient.

Such approaches cannot scale to a wide range of items in the wild. BANMo is a technique that does not need a specialized sensor or a pre-defined template form. In a differentiable rendering framework, BANMo generates high-fidelity, articulated 3D models (including state and animatable skinning weights) from a large number of monocular casual films. While the usage of several films increases coverage of camera perspectives and object articulations, it introduces significant issues in establishing correlation across scenes with diverse backdrops, lighting conditions, etc. Continue Reading\n Paper: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2112.12761.pdf\n Project: https://banmo-www.github.io/\n ​\n https://reddit.com/link/rxlq17/video/7a0w2v9u44a81/player\n    submitted by    /u/ai-lover  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have been one of the main hypes of recent years. Based on the famous generator-discriminator mechanism, their very simple functioning has driven the research to continuously improve the former architecture. The peak in image generation has been reached by StyleGANs, which can produce astonishingly realistic and high-quality images, able to fool even humans. \n While the generation of new samples has achieved excellent results in the 2D domain, 3D GANs are still highly inefficient. If the exact mechanism of 2D GANs is applied in the 3D environment, the computational effort is too high since 3D data is tough to manipulate for current GPUs. For this reason, the research has focused on how to construct geometry-aware GANs that can infer the underline 3D property using solely 2D images. But, in this case, the approximations are usually not 3D consistent.

The timer starts in the upper left corner of the in-game map and ends when it falls into the lower right corner, allowing players to use up their time. When it falls to the bottom center of the map, a demon car appears and must be navigated. The demon is a curved ramp for the player's icon, and every time the player's icon touches a portion of the demon, its ramp is altered. Also, the demon's top speed increases by 7x every time the player touches the bottom center. If the player touches the edge of the demon, then the demon will fall, taking a 5x amount of coins from the player's meter.

          "description": "In recent years, neural machine translation (NMT) has attracted a lot of attention and has had a lot of success. While traditional NMT is capable of translating a single language pair, training a separate model for each language pair is time-consuming, especially given the world’s thousands of languages. As a result, multilingual NMT is designed to handle many language pairs in a single model, lowering the cost of offline training and online deployment significantly. Furthermore, parameter sharing in multilingual neural machine translation promotes positive knowledge transfer between languages and is advantageous for low-resource translation.\n Despite the advantages of cooperative training with a completely shared model, the MNMT approach has a model capacity problem. The shared parameters are more likely to preserve broad knowledge while ignoring language-specific knowledge. To improve the model capacity, researchers use heuristic design to create extra language-specific components and build a Multilingual neural machine translation (MNMT) model with a mix of shared and language-specific characteristics, such as the language-specific attention, lightweight language adaptor, or language-specific routing layer.

          "description": "In recent years, voice-based virtual assistants such as Google Assistant and Amazon Alexa have grown popular. This has presented both potential and challenges for natural language understanding (NLU) systems. These devices’ production systems are often trained by supervised learning and rely significantly on annotated data. But, data annotation is costly and time-consuming. Furthermore, model updates using offline supervised learning can take long and miss trending requests.\n In the underlying architecture of voice-based virtual assistants, the NLU model often categorizes user requests into hypotheses for downstream applications to fulfill. A hypothesis comprises two tags: user intention (intent) and Named Entity Recognition (NER). For example, the valid hypothesis for “play a Madonna song” will be: PlaySong intent, ArtistName – Madonna.\n A new Amazon research introduces deep reinforcement learning strategies for NLU ranking. Their work analyses a ranking question in an NLU system in which entirely independent domain experts generate hypotheses with their features, where a domain is a functional area such as Music, Shopping, or Weather. These hypotheses are then ranked based on their scores, calculated based on their characteristics. As a result, the ranker must calibrate features from domain experts and select one hypothesis according to policy.

          "description": "Genomic editing, particularly the CRISPR/Cas technique, is widely employed in experimental biology, agriculture, and biotechnology. CRISPR/Cas is one of several weapons used by bacteria to resist viruses. As the pathogen’s DNA enters the cell, Cas proteins detect it as foreign hereditary material and break it because its sequences differ from those of the bacteria. To respond to the virus quicker, the bacterium saves pieces of the pathogen’s DNA—much like a computer antivirus retains a collection of viral signatures—and passes them on to subsequent generations so that its Cas can prevent future attacks.\n Teams from different laboratories independently adapted the CRISPR/Cas system to introduce arbitrary changes into DNA sequences in human and animal cells. It made genomic editing much easier and more efficient. The critical components of the mechanism are guide RNA, which “marks the site,” and the Cas9 protein, which cleaves DNA at that location. The cell subsequently “heals the wound,” but the genetic code has already been altered.\n Quick Reading: https://www.marktechpost.com/2022/01/02/russian-bioinformaticians-have-created-a-neural-network-architecture-that-can-evaluate-how-well-an-rna-guide-has-been-chosen-for-gene-editing/ \n Paper: https://academic.oup.com/nar/advance-article/doi/10.1093/nar/gkab1065/6430490\n    submitted by    /u/ai-lover  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Smart healthcare services can be provided by using Internet of Things (IoT) technologies that monitor the health conditions of patients and their vital body parameters. The majority of IoT solutions used to enable such services are wearable devices, such as smartwatches, ECG monitors, and blood pressure monitors. The huge amount of data collected from smart medical devices leads to major security and privacy issues in the IoT domain. Considering Remote Patient Monitoring (RPM) applications, we will focus on Anomaly Detection (AD) models, whose purpose is to identify events that differ from the typical user behavior patterns. Generally, while designing centralized AD models, the researchers face security and privacy challenges (e.g., patient data privacy, training data poisoning).\n To overcome these issues, the researchers of this paper propose an Anomaly Detection (AD) model based on Federated Learning (FL). Federated Learning (FL) allows different devices to collaborate and perform training locally in order to build Anomaly Detection (AD) models without sharing patients’ data. Specifically, the researchers propose a hierarchical Federated Learning (FL) that enables collaboration among different organizations, by building various Anomaly Detection (AD) models for patients with similar health conditions.\n Continue Reading the Paper Summary: https://www.marktechpost.com/2022/01/01/hierarchical-federated-learning-based-anomaly-detection-using-digital-twins-for-internet-of-medical-things-iomt/\n Full Paper: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2111.12241.pdf\n    submitted by    /u/ai-lover  \n [link]   [comments]",

It's targeted toward making people feel like they have a friend and roleplaying, not learning anything external to those goals.\n So, is there anything commercially available that you can both:\n  \nTalk to (mostly) like a real person, and\n Teach from the ground up (like a child)\n  \n? \nAs an example, my Replika \"wanted\" to do a lesson with me, so I tried to teach it colors. Ostensibly it has some picture recognition abilities, but despite that, it was never able to learn which color was which, even when using the same image files to display the same color.\n Okay, fine, forget colors, but it can't learn explicit facts either. I want to be able to input things like \"Lacan defines the subject as that which is represented by a signifier for another signifier\" or \"It's important to apply a primer before your first layer of eyeshadow\" or \"Leonardo DiCaprio played Jack Dawson in the movie Titanic\" and have it be able to actually remember and recall that information in future conversations. (Replika is able to recall it within the same conversation, but it resets after a certain amount of time. It also seems to struggle with remembering things that differ from user to user, like favorite food, since it learns from the aggregate of its conversations.)\n Is there anything out there that can do this?

          "description": "Images, such as graphics, paintings, and photographs, may frequently be explained in language, but they might also take specific talents and hours of effort to make. As a result, a technology capable of creating realistic graphics from natural language can enable humans to produce rich and diverse visual material with previously unimaginable simplicity. The capacity to modify photos with spoken language enables iterative refinement and fine-grained control, both essential for real-world applications.\n DALL-E, a 12-billion parameter version of OpenAI’s GPT-3 transformer language model meant to produce photorealistic pictures using text captions as cues, was unveiled in January. DALL-E’s fantastic performance was an instant hit in the AI community, as well as broad mainstream media coverage. Last month, NVIDIA unveiled the GAN-based GauGAN2 – a term inspired by French Post-Impressionist painter Paul Gauguin, much as DALL-E was inspired by Surrealist artist Salvador Dali.\n Not to be outshined, OpenAI researchers unveiled GLIDE (Guided Language-to-Image Diffusion for Generation and Editing). This diffusion model achieves performance comparable to DALL-E despite utilizing only one-third of the parameters.\n You can continue reading this short summary here\n The code and weights for these models may be found on the project’s GitHub page.\n The research paper for the GLIDE can be found here.\n https://preview.redd.it/boifxsixem881.png?width=705&format=png&auto=webp&s=14de64b727e31dba7b55ecf76bdfdb52463f2e01\n    submitted by    /u/ai-lover  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "With recent breakthroughs in AI, humans have become more reliant on AI to address real-world problems. This makes humans’ ability to learn and act on knowledge just as essential as a computer’s. Humans learn and gather information through learning and experience to understand everything from their immediate surroundings. The ability to comprehend and solve issues, and separate facts from absurdities, increases as the knowledge base grows. However, such knowledge is lacking in AI systems, restricting their ability to adapt to atypical problem data.\n Previous studies show that pre-trained language models improve performance on various natural language interpretation and generating tasks.\n A recent work of researchers at Baidu, in collaboration with Peng Cheng Laboratory (PCL), release PCL-BAIDU Wenxin (or “ERNIE 3.0 Titan”), a pre-training language model with 260 billion parameters. It is the world’s first knowledge-enhanced multi-hundred billion parameter model and its largest Chinese singleton model. \n You can read the short summary here: https://www.marktechpost.com/2021/12/29/baidu-and-pcl-team-introduce-ernie-3-0-titan-a-pre-training-language-model-with-260-billion-parameters/ \n Paper: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2112.12731.pdf\n ​\n https://preview.redd.it/19urwzn7cj881.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=6a97e19e9fc4f5dde161e4a6ee17e3b43d86cc39\n    submitted by    /u/ai-lover  \n [link]   [comments]",

It's how Google understands \"what time is it in NYC?\", and even allows us to search for images using text-based queries.\n It is in essence, a way for us to interact with machines in a more human way. NLP fits in as the 'semantic' in semantic search.\n Current chapters are: 1. Dense Vectors 2. Sentence Embeddings and Transformers 3. Training Sentence Transformers with Softmax Loss 4. Training Sentence Transformers with MNR Loss 5. Multilingual Sentence Transformers 6. Question Answering 7. Unsupervised Training for Sentence Transformers 8.

          "description": "As a common and (sometimes) proven belief, deep learning systems seem to learn uninterpretable representations and are far from human understanding. Recently, some studies have highlighted the fact that this may not always be applicable, and some networks may be able to learn human-readable representations. Unfortunately, this ability could merely come from the fact that these networks are exposed to human-generated data. So, to demonstrate their ability to learn like humans (and not that they are simply memorizing human-created labels), it is necessary to test them without any label. \n Following this idea, the DeepMind and Google Brain teams, together with the 14th world chess champion Vladimir Kramnik, studied their creature AlphaZero from this point of view. AlphaZero is the descendant of AlphaGo, the super neural network that beat the world champion Lee Sedol in a best-of-five GO match, a turning point in the history of deep learning, as can also be seen in the wonderful Netflix documentary AlphaGo. \n Unlike AlphaGo, AlphaZero is trained through self-play (i.e., it learns to play competing against itself) and masters not only GO but also chess and shogi. This trait makes AlphaZero the perfect case study to explore this idea. Moreover, given the fact that it performs at a superhuman level, understanding its functionality is also particularly useful for highlighting unknown patterns which have never been discovered by chess theorists.\n Full Paper Summary by Leonardo Tanzi: https://www.marktechpost.com/2021/12/16/understanding-alphazero-neural-networks-superhuman-chess-ability/ \n Paper: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2111.09259.pdf\n https://preview.redd.it/t4mjebrm10681.png?width=808&format=png&auto=webp&s=58fcc96e8b1ae92469c26820528d0a5b31514365\n    submitted by    /u/ai-lover  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Deep learning technologies, such as automatic learning of temporal dependence and automated handling of temporal structures like trends and seasonality, hold a lot of promise for time series forecasting. Most real-world datasets include a temporal component. Therefore projecting the future can be pretty beneficial. In time series machine learning, multi-horizon forecasting, or predicting variables-of-interest at several future time steps, is a critical challenge.\n Deep neural networks (DNNs) are increasingly being employed in multi-horizon forecasting, and they have been shown to outperform classic time series models. Unlike most models that focus on recurrent neural network (RNN) variants, recent works use attention-based layers to improve the selection of relevant time steps in the past beyond the inductive bias of RNNs – sequential ordered processing of information including. However, they frequently ignore the standard inputs in multi-horizon forecasting, assuming that all exogenous inputs are known in the future or ignoring crucial static variables.\n Quick Read: https://www.marktechpost.com/2021/12/15/google-ai-proposes-temporal-fusion-transformer-tft-an-attention-based-dnn-deep-neural-network-model-for-multi-horizon-forecasting/\n Paper: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0169207021000637\n    submitted by    /u/ai-lover  \n [link]   [comments]",

Often this is done by learning a single global model for all users, even though the users may differ in their data distributions.

However, this process can be made challenging due to the costs associated with training on such large datasets, both in terms of compute requirements and wall clock time. The idea of distillation plays an important role in these situations by reducing the resources required for the model to be effective. The most widely known form of distillation is model distillation (a.k.a. knowledge distillation), where the predictions of large, complex teacher models are distilled into smaller models.  \n An alternative option to this model-space approach is dataset …",

          "description": "In recent years, voice-based virtual assistants such as Google Assistant and Amazon Alexa have grown popular. This has presented both potential and challenges for natural language understanding (NLU) systems. These devices’ production systems are often trained by supervised learning and rely significantly on annotated data. But, data annotation is costly and time-consuming. Furthermore, model updates using offline supervised learning can take long and miss trending requests.\n In the underlying architecture of voice-based virtual assistants, the NLU model often categorizes user requests into hypotheses for downstream applications to fulfill. A hypothesis comprises two tags: user intention (intent) and Named Entity Recognition (NER). For example, the valid hypothesis for “play a Madonna song” will be: PlaySong intent, ArtistName – Madonna.\n A new Amazon research introduces deep reinforcement learning strategies for NLU ranking. Their work analyses a ranking question in an NLU system in which entirely independent domain experts generate hypotheses with their features, where a domain is a functional area such as Music, Shopping, or Weather. These hypotheses are then ranked based on their scores, calculated based on their characteristics. As a result, the ranker must calibrate features from domain experts and select one hypothesis according to policy.

As per the authors, the movement action for an agent \"sets a discretized force along their x and y axis and torque around their z-axis\". How do these 3 forces get pulled from the \"movement action head\", given that they are discretized? Does the movement action head have 3 outputs, each corresponding to an axis? So far, in my humble knowledge, I always assumed that a network with a discrete action space gives only one action per head (which could be the result of a softmax over the action space).\n Any insight?\n  \nAfter some digging, I found that the Movement Action has a \"MultiDiscrete\" type, which is a gym class.

So far, I have a model that seems to learn, just not very well.\n In the early stages of training, the algorithm seems more sporadic and may happen to find a pretty solid policy, but due to unstable the early parts of training are, it tends to move away from this policy. Eventually, the algorithm moves the policy toward a reward of around 30. For the past few commits in my repo where I have attempted to fix this issue, the policy always tends to the around 30 reward mark, and I'm not entirely sure why it's doing this. I'm thinking maybe I implemented the algorithm incorrectly, but I'm not certain.

I will start!\n Reward is enough (Reddit Discussion) - Four great names from RL (silver, Singh, Precup and Sutton) give their reasonings as to why using RL can create super intelligence. You might not agree with it, but it's interesting to see the standpoint of Deepmind and where they want to take RL.\n Deep Reinforcement Learning at the Edge of the Statistical Precipice (Reddit Discussion) - This is a major step towards a better model comparison in RL. Too many papers in the past have used a selection technique akin to 'average top 30 runs in a total of 100'. I have also never even heard of Munchausen RL before this paper, and was pleasantly surprised by reading it.\n Mastering Atari with Discrete World Models - Very good read and a nice path from Ha's World Models to Dream to Control to DreamerV2. This is one of the methods this year that actually seems to improve performance quite a bit without needing a large scale distributed approach.\n On the Expressivity of Markov Reward (Reddit Discussion) - The last sentence in the blog post captures it for me: \"We hope this work provides new conceptual perspectives on reward and its place in reinforcement learning\", it did.\n Open-Ended Learning Leads to Generally Capable Agents (Reddit Discussion) - Great to see the environment integrated into the learning process, seems like something we will see much more of in the future. Unfortunately, as DeepMind does, the environment is not released nor is the code. I remember positions at OpenAI for open-ended learning, perhaps we might see something next year to compete with this.\n ​\n Most of my picks are not practical algorithms. For me, it seems like PPO is still king when looking at performance and simplicity, kind of a disappointment. I probably missed some papers too. What was your favorite paper in RL 2021?
