          "description": "Some applications of deep learning require not only to provide accurate\nresults but also to quantify the amount of confidence in their prediction. The\nmanagement of an electric power grid is one of these cases: to avoid risky\nscenarios, decision-makers need both precise and reliable forecasts of, for\nexample, power loads. For this reason, point forecasts are not enough hence it\nis necessary to adopt methods that provide an uncertainty quantification.\n\nThis work focuses on reservoir computing as the core time series forecasting\nmethod, due to its computational efficiency and effectiveness in predicting\ntime series. While the RC literature mostly focused on point forecasting, this\nwork explores the compatibility of some popular uncertainty quantification\nmethods with the reservoir setting. Both Bayesian and deterministic approaches\nto uncertainty assessment are evaluated and compared in terms of their\nprediction accuracy, computational resource efficiency and reliability of the\nestimated uncertainty, based on a set of carefully chosen performance metrics.",

          "description": "Vision-Language Pre-training (VLP) shows remarkable progress with the\nassistance of extremely heavy parameters, which challenges deployment in real\napplications. Knowledge distillation is well recognized as the essential\nprocedure in model compression. However, existing knowledge distillation\ntechniques lack an in-depth investigation and analysis of VLP, and practical\nguidelines for VLP-oriented distillation are still not yet explored. In this\npaper, we present DLIP, a simple yet efficient Distilling Language-Image\nPre-training framework, through which we investigate how to distill a light VLP\nmodel. Specifically, we dissect the model distillation from multiple\ndimensions, such as the architecture characteristics of different modules and\nthe information transfer of different modalities. We conduct comprehensive\nexperiments and provide insights on distilling a light but performant VLP\nmodel. Experimental results reveal that DLIP can achieve a state-of-the-art\naccuracy/efficiency trade-off across diverse cross-modal tasks, e.g.,\nimage-text retrieval, image captioning and visual question answering. For\nexample, DLIP compresses BLIP by 1.9x, from 213M to 108M parameters, while\nachieving comparable or better performance. Furthermore, DLIP succeeds in\nretaining more than 95% of the performance with 22.4% parameters and 24.8%\nFLOPs compared to the teacher model and accelerates inference speed by 2.7x.",

Related\nwork in machine learning has translated the concept of equal treatment into\nterms of equal outcome and measured it as demographic parity (also called\nstatistical parity). Our analysis reveals that the two concepts of equal\noutcome and equal treatment diverge; therefore, demographic parity does not\nfaithfully represent the notion of equal treatment. We propose a new\nformalization for equal treatment by (i) considering the influence of feature\nvalues on predictions, such as computed by Shapley values explaining\nclassifications, (ii) defining distributions of explanations, and (iii)\ncomparing explanation distributions between populations with different\nprotected characteristics.

          "description": "Decision-making problems can be represented as mathematical optimization\nmodels, finding wide applications in fields such as economics, engineering and\nmanufacturing, transportation, and health care. Optimization models are\nmathematical abstractions of the problem of making the best decision while\nsatisfying a set of requirements or constraints. One of the primary barriers to\ndeploying these models in practice is the challenge of helping practitioners\nunderstand and interpret such models, particularly when they are infeasible,\nmeaning no decision satisfies all the constraints. Existing methods for\ndiagnosing infeasible optimization models often rely on expert systems,\nnecessitating significant background knowledge in optimization. In this paper,\nwe introduce OptiChat, a first-of-its-kind natural language-based system\nequipped with a chatbot GUI for engaging in interactive conversations about\ninfeasible optimization models. OptiChat can provide natural language\ndescriptions of the optimization model itself, identify potential sources of\ninfeasibility, and offer suggestions to make the model feasible. The\nimplementation of OptiChat is built on GPT-4, which interfaces with an\noptimization solver to identify the minimal subset of constraints that render\nthe entire optimization problem infeasible, also known as the Irreducible\nInfeasible Subset (IIS). We utilize few-shot learning, expert chain-of-thought,\nkey-retrieve, and sentiment prompts to enhance OptiChat's reliability. Our\nexperiments demonstrate that OptiChat assists both expert and non-expert users\nin improving their understanding of the optimization models, enabling them to\nquickly identify the sources of infeasibility.",

We analyze the\npotential causes of the extrapolation step failing in some algorithms, and\nresolve this issue by enhancing the comparison process that evaluates the\ntrade-off between the proximal gradient step and the linear extrapolation step\nin our algorithm. Furthermore, we extends our algorithm to any scenario\ninvolving updating block variables with positive integers, allowing each cycle\nto randomly shuffle the update order of the variable blocks. Additionally,\nunder mild assumptions, we prove that ABPL$^+$ can monotonically decrease the\nfunction value without strictly restricting the extrapolation parameters and\nstep size, demonstrates the viability and effectiveness of updating these\nblocks in a random order, and we also more obviously and intuitively\ndemonstrate that the derivative set of the sequence generated by our algorithm\nis a critical point set. Moreover, we demonstrate the global convergence as\nwell as the linear and sublinear convergence rates of our algorithm by\nutilizing the Kurdyka-Lojasiewicz (K{\\L}) condition. To enhance the\neffectiveness and flexibility of our algorithm, we also expand the study to the\nimprecise version of our algorithm and construct an adaptive extrapolation\nparameter strategy, which improving its overall performance.

          "description": "We consider the problem of simultaneously clustering and learning a linear\nrepresentation of data lying close to a union of low-dimensional manifolds, a\nfundamental task in machine learning and computer vision. When the manifolds\nare assumed to be linear subspaces, this reduces to the classical problem of\nsubspace clustering, which has been studied extensively over the past two\ndecades. Unfortunately, many real-world datasets such as natural images can not\nbe well approximated by linear subspaces. On the other hand, numerous works\nhave attempted to learn an appropriate transformation of the data, such that\ndata is mapped from a union of general non-linear manifolds to a union of\nlinear subspaces (with points from the same manifold being mapped to the same\nsubspace). However, many existing works have limitations such as assuming\nknowledge of the membership of samples to clusters, requiring high sampling\ndensity, or being shown theoretically to learn trivial representations. In this\npaper, we propose to optimize the Maximal Coding Rate Reduction metric with\nrespect to both the data representation and a novel doubly stochastic cluster\nmembership, inspired by state-of-the-art subspace clustering results. We give a\nparameterization of such a representation and membership, allowing efficient\nmini-batching and one-shot initialization. Experiments on CIFAR-10, -20, -100,\nand TinyImageNet-200 datasets show that the proposed method is much more\naccurate and scalable than state-of-the-art deep clustering methods, and\nfurther learns a latent linear representation of the data.",

We employ optimal transport\ntheory to propose the Wasserstein geodesic generator, a new conditional\ngenerator that learns the Wasserstein geodesic. The proposed method learns both\nconditional distributions for observed domains and optimal transport maps\nbetween them. The conditional distributions given unobserved intermediate\ndomains are on the Wasserstein geodesic between conditional distributions given\ntwo observed domain labels. Experiments on face images with light conditions as\ndomain labels demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed method.",

          "description": "Federated learning (FL) is an emerging approach for training machine learning\nmodels collaboratively while preserving data privacy. The need for privacy\nprotection makes it difficult for FL models to achieve global transparency and\nexplainability. To address this limitation, we incorporate logic-based\nexplanations into FL by proposing the Logical Reasoning-based eXplainable\nFederated Learning (LR-XFL) approach. Under LR-XFL, FL clients create local\nlogic rules based on their local data and send them, along with model updates,\nto the FL server. The FL server connects the local logic rules through a proper\nlogical connector that is derived based on properties of client data, without\nrequiring access to the raw data. In addition, the server also aggregates the\nlocal model updates with weight values determined by the quality of the\nclients' local data as reflected by their uploaded logic rules. The results\nshow that LR-XFL outperforms the most relevant baseline by 1.19%, 5.81% and\n5.41% in terms of classification accuracy, rule accuracy and rule fidelity,\nrespectively. The explicit rule evaluation and expression under LR-XFL enable\nhuman experts to validate and correct the rules on the server side, hence\nimproving the global FL model's robustness to errors. It has the potential to\nenhance the transparency of FL models for areas like healthcare and finance\nwhere both data privacy and explainability are important.",

They can\nprocess large volumes of data quickly, but they do not detect all vocalisations\nand they do generate some false positives (vocalisations that are not from the\ntarget species).

Acquiring\nsufficient training data is another challenge limiting models' applications. We\nproposed to leverage the consistency of organs' anatomical shape and position\ninformation in medical images. We introduced a framework leveraging recurring\nanatomical patterns through global binary masks for organ segmentation. Two\nscenarios were studied.1) Global binary masks were the only model's (i.e.\nU-Net) input, forcing exclusively encoding organs' position and shape\ninformation for segmentation/localization.2) Global binary masks were\nincorporated as an additional channel functioning as position/shape clues to\nmitigate training data scarcity. Two datasets of the brain and heart CT images\nwith their ground-truth were split into (26:10:10) and (12:3:5) for training,\nvalidation, and test respectively. Training exclusively on global binary masks\nled to Dice scores of 0.77(0.06) and 0.85(0.04), with the average Euclidian\ndistance of 3.12(1.43)mm and 2.5(0.93)mm relative to the center of mass of the\nground truth for the brain and heart structures respectively. The outcomes\nindicate that a surprising degree of position and shape information is encoded\nthrough global binary masks. Incorporating global binary masks led to\nsignificantly higher accuracy relative to the model trained on only CT images\nin small subsets of training data; the performance improved by 4.3-125.3% and\n1.3-48.1% for 1-8 training cases of the brain and heart datasets respectively.\nThe findings imply the advantages of utilizing global binary masks for building\ngeneralizable models and to compensate for training data scarcity.",

Several\ncloud providers and other enterprises have made substantial plans of growth in\ntheir datacenters to support these new workloads. One of the key bottleneck\nresources in datacenters is power, and given the increasing model sizes of\nLLMs, they are becoming increasingly power intensive. In this paper, we show\nthat there is a significant opportunity to oversubscribe power in LLM clusters.\nPower oversubscription improves the power efficiency of these datacenters,\nallowing more deployable servers per datacenter, and reduces the deployment\ntime, since building new datacenters is slow.\n\nWe extensively characterize the power consumption patterns of a variety of\nLLMs and their configurations. We identify the differences between the\ninference and training power consumption patterns. Based on our analysis of\nthese LLMs, we claim that the average and peak power utilization in LLM\nclusters for inference should not be very high. Our deductions align with the\ndata from production LLM clusters, revealing that inference workloads offer\nsubstantial headroom for power oversubscription. However, the stringent set of\ntelemetry and controls that GPUs offer in a virtualized environment, makes it\nchallenging to have a reliable and robust power oversubscription mechanism.\n\nWe propose POLCA, our framework for power oversubscription that is robust,\nreliable, and readily deployable for GPU clusters. Using open-source models to\nreplicate the power patterns observed in production, we simulate POLCA and\ndemonstrate that we can deploy 30% more servers in the same GPU cluster for\ninference, with minimal performance loss",

          "description": "Deep autoencoders provide an effective tool for learning non-linear\ndimensionality reduction in an unsupervised way. Recently, they have been used\nfor the task of anomaly detection in the visual domain. By optimizing for the\nreconstruction error using anomaly-free examples, the common belief is that a\ncorresponding network should fail to accurately reconstruct anomalous regions\nin the application phase. This goal is typically addressed by controlling the\ncapacity of the network, either by reducing the size of the bottleneck layer or\nby enforcing sparsity constraints on the activations. However, neither of these\ntechniques does explicitly penalize reconstruction of anomalous signals often\nresulting in poor detection. We tackle this problem by adapting a\nself-supervised learning regime that allows the use of discriminative\ninformation during training but focuses on the data manifold of normal\nexamples. We emphasize that inference with our approach is very efficient\nduring training and prediction requiring a single forward pass for each input\nimage. Our experiments on the MVTec AD dataset demonstrate high detection and\nlocalization performance. On the texture-subset, in particular, our approach\nconsistently outperforms recent anomaly detection methods by a significant\nmargin.",

          "description": "Multimedia recommendation involves personalized ranking tasks, where\nmultimedia content is usually represented using a generic encoder. However,\nthese generic representations introduce spurious correlations that fail to\nreveal users' true preferences. Existing works attempt to alleviate this\nproblem by learning invariant representations, but overlook the balance between\nindependent and identically distributed (IID) and out-of-distribution (OOD)\ngeneralization. In this paper, we propose a framework called Pareto Invariant\nRepresentation Learning (PaInvRL) to mitigate the impact of spurious\ncorrelations from an IID-OOD multi-objective optimization perspective, by\nlearning invariant representations (intrinsic factors that attract user\nattention) and variant representations (other factors) simultaneously.\nSpecifically, PaInvRL includes three iteratively executed modules: (i)\nheterogeneous identification module, which identifies the heterogeneous\nenvironments to reflect distributional shifts for user-item interactions; (ii)\ninvariant mask generation module, which learns invariant masks based on the\nPareto-optimal solutions that minimize the adaptive weighted Invariant Risk\nMinimization (IRM) and Empirical Risk (ERM) losses; (iii) convert module, which\ngenerates both variant representations and item-invariant representations for\ntraining a multi-modal recommendation model that mitigates spurious\ncorrelations and balances the generalization performance within and cross the\nenvironmental distributions. We compare the proposed PaInvRL with\nstate-of-the-art recommendation models on three public multimedia\nrecommendation datasets (Movielens, Tiktok, and Kwai), and the experimental\nresults validate the effectiveness of PaInvRL for both within- and\ncross-environmental learning.",

As a\nsimple solution, blur guidance improves the suitability of intermediate samples\nfor their fine-scale information and structures, enabling diffusion models to\ngenerate higher quality samples with a moderate guidance scale. Improving upon\nthis, Self-Attention Guidance (SAG) uses the intermediate self-attention maps\nof diffusion models to enhance their stability and efficacy. Specifically, SAG\nadversarially blurs only the regions that diffusion models attend to at each\niteration and guides them accordingly.

          "description": "Deep learning has achieved impressive performance in many domains, such as\ncomputer vision and natural language processing, but its advantage over\nclassical shallow methods on tabular datasets remains questionable. It is\nespecially challenging to surpass the performance of tree-like ensembles, such\nas XGBoost or Random Forests, on small-sized datasets (less than 1k samples).\nTo tackle this challenge, we introduce HyperTab, a hypernetwork-based approach\nto solving small sample problems on tabular datasets. By combining the\nadvantages of Random Forests and neural networks, HyperTab generates an\nensemble of neural networks, where each target model is specialized to process\na specific lower-dimensional view of the data. Since each view plays the role\nof data augmentation, we virtually increase the number of training samples\nwhile keeping the number of trainable parameters unchanged, which prevents\nmodel overfitting. We evaluated HyperTab on more than 40 tabular datasets of a\nvarying number of samples and domains of origin, and compared its performance\nwith shallow and deep learning models representing the current\nstate-of-the-art. We show that HyperTab consistently outranks other methods on\nsmall data (with a statistically significant difference) and scores comparable\nto them on larger datasets.\n\nWe make a python package with the code available to download at\nhttps://pypi.org/project/hypertab/",

          "description": "Assessing the robustness of deep neural networks against out-of-distribution\ninputs is crucial, especially in safety-critical domains like autonomous\ndriving, but also in safety systems where malicious actors can digitally alter\ninputs to circumvent safety guards. However, designing effective\nout-of-distribution tests that encompass all possible scenarios while\npreserving accurate label information is a challenging task. Existing\nmethodologies often entail a compromise between variety and constraint levels\nfor attacks and sometimes even both. In a first step towards a more holistic\nrobustness evaluation of image classification models, we introduce an attack\nmethod based on image solarization that is conceptually straightforward yet\navoids jeopardizing the global structure of natural images independent of the\nintensity. Through comprehensive evaluations of multiple ImageNet models, we\ndemonstrate the attack's capacity to degrade accuracy significantly, provided\nit is not integrated into the training augmentations. Interestingly, even then,\nno full immunity to accuracy deterioration is achieved. In other settings, the\nattack can often be simplified into a black-box attack with model-independent\nparameters.

          "description": "Conformal prediction is a statistical tool for producing prediction regions\nof machine learning models that are valid with high probability. However,\napplying conformal prediction to time series data leads to conservative\nprediction regions. In fact, to obtain prediction regions over $T$ time steps\nwith confidence $1-\\delta$, {previous works require that each individual\nprediction region is valid} with confidence $1-\\delta/T$. We propose an\noptimization-based method for reducing this conservatism to enable long horizon\nplanning and verification when using learning-enabled time series predictors.\nInstead of considering prediction errors individually at each time step, we\nconsider a parameterized prediction error over multiple time steps. By\noptimizing the parameters over an additional dataset, we find prediction\nregions that are not conservative. We show that this problem can be cast as a\nmixed integer linear complementarity program (MILCP), which we then relax into\na linear complementarity program (LCP). Additionally, we prove that the relaxed\nLP has the same optimal cost as the original MILCP. Finally, we demonstrate the\nefficacy of our method on case studies using pedestrian trajectory predictors\nand F16 fighter jet altitude predictors.",

          "description": "Deep learning-based surrogate models have been widely applied in geological\ncarbon storage (GCS) problems to accelerate the prediction of reservoir\npressure and CO2 plume migration. Large amounts of data from physics-based\nnumerical simulators are required to train a model to accurately predict the\ncomplex physical behaviors associated with this process. In practice, the\navailable training data are always limited in large-scale 3D problems due to\nthe high computational cost. Therefore, we propose to use a multi-fidelity\nFourier Neural Operator to solve large-scale GCS problems with more affordable\nmulti-fidelity training datasets. The Fourier Neural Operator has a desirable\ngrid-invariant property, which simplifies the transfer learning procedure\nbetween datasets with different discretization. We first test the model\nefficacy on a GCS reservoir model being discretized into 110k grid cells. The\nmulti-fidelity model can predict with accuracy comparable to a high-fidelity\nmodel trained with the same amount of high-fidelity data with 81% less data\ngeneration costs. We further test the generalizability of the multi-fidelity\nmodel on a same reservoir model with a finer discretization of 1 million grid\ncells. This case was made more challenging by employing high-fidelity and\nlow-fidelity datasets generated by different geostatistical models and\nreservoir simulators. We observe that the multi-fidelity FNO model can predict\npressure fields with reasonable accuracy even when the high-fidelity data are\nextremely limited.",

          "description": "The wide application of deep neural networks (DNNs) demands an increasing\namount of attention to their real-world robustness, i.e., whether a DNN resists\nblack-box adversarial attacks, among which score-based query attacks (SQAs) are\nmost threatening since they can effectively hurt a victim network with the only\naccess to model outputs. Defending against SQAs requires a slight but artful\nvariation of outputs due to the service purpose for users, who share the same\noutput information with SQAs. In this paper, we propose a real-world defense by\nUnifying Gradients (UniG) of different data so that SQAs could only probe a\nmuch weaker attack direction that is similar for different samples. Since such\nuniversal attack perturbations have been validated as less aggressive than the\ninput-specific perturbations, UniG protects real-world DNNs by indicating\nattackers a twisted and less informative attack direction. We implement UniG\nefficiently by a Hadamard product module which is plug-and-play. According to\nextensive experiments on 5 SQAs, 2 adaptive attacks and 7 defense baselines,\nUniG significantly improves real-world robustness without hurting clean\naccuracy on CIFAR10 and ImageNet. For instance, UniG maintains a model of\n77.80% accuracy under 2500-query Square attack while the state-of-the-art\nadversarially-trained model only has 67.34% on CIFAR10. Simultaneously, UniG\noutperforms all compared baselines in terms of clean accuracy and achieves the\nsmallest modification of the model output.

Assessment of the kinetic parameters\nalso raises challenges, as reactive coefficients are critical parameters that\ncan cover a wide range of values. We account for these two issues and ensure\nreliable calibration of pore-scale modeling, based on dynamical microCT images,\nby integrating uncertainty quantification in the workflow.\n\nThe present method is based on a multitasking formulation of reactive inverse\nproblems combining data-driven and physics-informed techniques in calcite\ndissolution. This allows quantifying morphological uncertainties on the\nporosity field and estimating reactive parameter ranges through prescribed PDE\nmodels with a latent concentration field and dynamical microCT. The data\nassimilation strategy relies on sequential reinforcement incorporating\nsuccessively additional PDE constraints. We guarantee robust and unbiased\nuncertainty quantification by straightforward adaptive weighting of Bayesian\nPhysics-Informed Neural Networks (BPINNs), ensuring reliable micro-porosity\nchanges during geochemical transformations. We demonstrate successful Bayesian\nInference in 1D+Time and 2D+Time calcite dissolution based on synthetic microCT\nimages with meaningful posterior distribution on the reactive parameters and\ndimensionless numbers.",

We\ncall this the Minimum Intrinsic Dimension scaling (MID scaling) phenomenon, and\nestablish MID scaling with no assumptions on the data distributions so long as\nthe cost is bounded and Lipschitz, and for various entropic optimal transport\nquantities beyond just values, with stronger analogs when one distribution is\nsupported on a manifold.

          "description": "Federated learning (FL) enables multiple parties to collaboratively train a\nmachine learning model without sharing their data; rather, they train their own\nmodel locally and send updates to a central server for aggregation. Depending\non how the data is distributed among the participants, FL can be classified\ninto Horizontal (HFL) and Vertical (VFL). In VFL, the participants share the\nsame set of training instances but only host a different and non-overlapping\nsubset of the whole feature space. Whereas in HFL, each participant shares the\nsame set of features while the training set is split into locally owned\ntraining data subsets.\n\nVFL is increasingly used in applications like financial fraud detection;\nnonetheless, very little work has analyzed its security. In this paper, we\nfocus on robustness in VFL, in particular, on backdoor attacks, whereby an\nadversary attempts to manipulate the aggregate model during the training\nprocess to trigger misclassifications. Performing backdoor attacks in VFL is\nmore challenging than in HFL, as the adversary i) does not have access to the\nlabels during training and ii) cannot change the labels as she only has access\nto the feature embeddings. We present a first-of-its-kind clean-label backdoor\nattack in VFL, which consists of two phases: a label inference and a backdoor\nphase. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the attack on three different\ndatasets, investigate the factors involved in its success, and discuss\ncountermeasures to mitigate its impact.",

          "description": "Deep learning based recommendation models (DLRM) are widely used in several\nbusiness critical applications. Training such recommendation models efficiently\nis challenging because they contain billions of embedding-based parameters,\nleading to significant overheads from embedding access. By profiling existing\nsystems for DLRM training, we observe that around 75\\% of the iteration time is\nspent on embedding access and model synchronization. Our key insight in this\npaper is that embedding access has a specific structure which can be used to\naccelerate training. We observe that embedding accesses are heavily skewed,\nwith around 1\\% of embeddings representing more than 92\\% of total accesses.\nFurther, we observe that during offline training we can lookahead at future\nbatches to determine exactly which embeddings will be needed at what iteration\nin the future. Based on these insights, we develop Bagpipe, a system for\ntraining deep recommendation models that uses caching and prefetching to\noverlap remote embedding accesses with the computation. We design an Oracle\nCacher, a new component that uses a lookahead algorithm to generate optimal\ncache update decisions while providing strong consistency guarantees against\nstaleness. We also design a logically replicated, physically partitioned cache\nand show that our design can reduce synchronization overheads in a distributed\nsetting. Finally, we propose a disaggregated system architecture and show that\nour design can enable low-overhead fault tolerance. Our experiments using three\ndatasets and four models show that Bagpipe provides a speed up of up to 5.6x\ncompared to state of the art baselines, while providing the same convergence\nand reproducibility guarantees as synchronous training.",

          "description": "This paper introduces a novel data-driven motion in-betweening system to\nreach target poses of characters by making use of phases variables learned by a\nPeriodic Autoencoder. Our approach utilizes a mixture-of-experts neural network\nmodel, in which the phases cluster movements in both space and time with\ndifferent expert weights. Each generated set of weights then produces a\nsequence of poses in an autoregressive manner between the current and target\nstate of the character. In addition, to satisfy poses which are manually\nmodified by the animators or where certain end effectors serve as constraints\nto be reached by the animation, a learned bi-directional control scheme is\nimplemented to satisfy such constraints. The results demonstrate that using\nphases for motion in-betweening tasks sharpen the interpolated movements, and\nfurthermore stabilizes the learning process. Moreover, using phases for motion\nin-betweening tasks can also synthesize more challenging movements beyond\nlocomotion behaviors. Additionally, style control is enabled between given\ntarget keyframes. Our proposed framework can compete with popular\nstate-of-the-art methods for motion in-betweening in terms of motion quality\nand generalization, especially in the existence of long transition durations.\nOur framework contributes to faster prototyping workflows for creating animated\ncharacter sequences, which is of enormous interest for the game and film\nindustry.",

          "description": "Logs are valuable information for oil and gas fields as they help to\ndetermine the lithology of the formations surrounding the borehole and the\nlocation and reserves of subsurface oil and gas reservoirs. However, important\nlogs are often missing in horizontal or old wells, which poses a challenge in\nfield applications. In this paper, we utilize data from the 2020 machine\nlearning competition of the SPWLA, which aims to predict the missing\ncompressional wave slowness and shear wave slowness logs using other logs in\nthe same borehole. We employ the NGBoost algorithm to construct an Ensemble\nLearning model that can predicate the results as well as their uncertainty.\nFurthermore, we combine the SHAP method to investigate the interpretability of\nthe machine learning model. We compare the performance of the NGBosst model\nwith four other commonly used Ensemble Learning methods, including Random\nForest, GBDT, XGBoost, LightGBM. The results show that the NGBoost model\nperforms well in the testing set and can provide a probability distribution for\nthe prediction results. In addition, the variance of the probability\ndistribution of the predicted log can be used to justify the quality of the\nconstructed log. Using the SHAP explainable machine learning model, we\ncalculate the importance of each input log to the predicted results as well as\nthe coupling relationship among input logs. Our findings reveal that the\nNGBoost model tends to provide greater slowness prediction results when the\nneutron porosity and gamma ray are large, which is consistent with the\ncognition of petrophysical models. Furthermore, the machine learning model can\ncapture the influence of the changing borehole caliper on slowness, where the\ninfluence of borehole caliper on slowness is complex and not easy to establish\na direct relationship. These findings are in line with the physical principle\nof borehole acoustics.",

          "description": "Deep learning models achieve excellent performance in numerous machine\nlearning tasks. Yet, they suffer from security-related issues such as\nadversarial examples and poisoning (backdoor) attacks. A deep learning model\nmay be poisoned by training with backdoored data or by modifying inner network\nparameters. Then, a backdoored model performs as expected when receiving a\nclean input, but it misclassifies when receiving a backdoored input stamped\nwith a pre-designed pattern called \"trigger\". Unfortunately, it is difficult to\ndistinguish between clean and backdoored models without prior knowledge of the\ntrigger. This paper proposes a backdoor detection method by utilizing a special\ntype of adversarial attack, universal adversarial perturbation (UAP), and its\nsimilarities with a backdoor trigger. We observe an intuitive phenomenon: UAPs\ngenerated from backdoored models need fewer perturbations to mislead the model\nthan UAPs from clean models. UAPs of backdoored models tend to exploit the\nshortcut from all classes to the target class, built by the backdoor trigger.\nWe propose a novel method called Universal Soldier for Backdoor detection (USB)\nand reverse engineering potential backdoor triggers via UAPs. Experiments on\n345 models trained on several datasets show that USB effectively detects the\ninjected backdoor and provides comparable or better results than\nstate-of-the-art methods.",

          "description": "As the feature size of integrated circuits continues to decrease, optical\nproximity correction (OPC) has emerged as a crucial resolution enhancement\ntechnology for ensuring high printability in the lithography process. Recently,\nlevel set-based inverse lithography technology (ILT) has drawn considerable\nattention as a promising OPC solution, showcasing its powerful pattern\nfidelity, especially in advanced process. However, massive computational time\nconsumption of ILT limits its applicability to mainly correcting partial layers\nand hotspot regions. Deep learning (DL) methods have shown great potential in\naccelerating ILT. However, lack of domain knowledge of inverse lithography\nlimits the ability of DL-based algorithms in process window (PW) enhancement\nand etc. In this paper, we propose an inverse lithography physics-informed deep\nneural level set (ILDLS) approach for mask optimization. This approach utilizes\nlevel set based-ILT as a layer within the DL framework and iteratively conducts\nmask prediction and correction to significantly enhance printability and PW in\ncomparison with results from pure DL and ILT. With this approach, computation\ntime is reduced by a few orders of magnitude versus ILT.

Most works use variable symmetries and several signatures, mainly based\non the cofactor, to simplify the canonical form construction and computation.\nThis paper describes a novel canonical form and its computation algorithm by\nintroducing Boolean influence to NPN classification, which is a basic concept\nin analysis of Boolean functions. We show that influence is\ninput-negation-independent, input-permutation-dependent, and has other\nstructural information than previous signatures for NPN classification.\nTherefore, it is a significant ingredient in speeding up NPN classification.\nExperimental results prove that influence plays an important role in reducing\nthe transformation enumeration in computing the canonical form.

One of the effective approaches is to offer some attractive incentive\nor additional services or money to the subscribers for keeping them engaged and\nmake sure they stay in the operator's network for longer time.

The\ndifficult part of this campaign is the selection of a set of customers from a\nlarge subscriber-base and deciding the amount that should be offered to an\nindividual so that operator's objective is achieved.

          "description": "Early sensory systems in the brain rapidly adapt to fluctuating input\nstatistics, which requires recurrent communication between neurons.\nMechanistically, such recurrent communication is often indirect and mediated by\nlocal interneurons. In this work, we explore the computational benefits of\nmediating recurrent communication via interneurons compared with direct\nrecurrent connections. To this end, we consider two mathematically tractable\nrecurrent linear neural networks that statistically whiten their inputs -- one\nwith direct recurrent connections and the other with interneurons that mediate\nrecurrent communication. By analyzing the corresponding continuous synaptic\ndynamics and numerically simulating the networks, we show that the network with\ninterneurons is more robust to initialization than the network with direct\nrecurrent connections in the sense that the convergence time for the synaptic\ndynamics in the network with interneurons (resp. direct recurrent connections)\nscales logarithmically (resp. linearly) with the spectrum of their\ninitialization. Our results suggest that interneurons are computationally\nuseful for rapid adaptation to changing input statistics. Interestingly, the\nnetwork with interneurons is an overparameterized solution of the whitening\nobjective for the network with direct recurrent connections, so our results can\nbe viewed as a recurrent linear neural network analogue of the implicit\nacceleration phenomenon observed in overparameterized feedforward linear neural\nnetworks.",

          "description": "Recent implicit neural representations have shown great results for novel\nview synthesis. However, existing methods require expensive per-scene\noptimization from many views hence limiting their application to real-world\nunbounded urban settings where the objects of interest or backgrounds are\nobserved from very few views. To mitigate this challenge, we introduce a new\napproach called NeO 360, Neural fields for sparse view synthesis of outdoor\nscenes. NeO 360 is a generalizable method that reconstructs 360{\\deg} scenes\nfrom a single or a few posed RGB images. The essence of our approach is in\ncapturing the distribution of complex real-world outdoor 3D scenes and using a\nhybrid image-conditional triplanar representation that can be queried from any\nworld point. Our representation combines the best of both voxel-based and\nbird's-eye-view (BEV) representations and is more effective and expressive than\neach. NeO 360's representation allows us to learn from a large collection of\nunbounded 3D scenes while offering generalizability to new views and novel\nscenes from as few as a single image during inference. We demonstrate our\napproach on the proposed challenging 360{\\deg} unbounded dataset, called NeRDS\n360, and show that NeO 360 outperforms state-of-the-art generalizable methods\nfor novel view synthesis while also offering editing and composition\ncapabilities.

          "description": "In order to coordinate energy interactions among various communities and\nenergy conversions among multi-energy subsystems within the multi-community\nintegrated energy system under uncertain conditions, and achieve overall\noptimization and scheduling of the comprehensive energy system, this paper\nproposes a comprehensive scheduling model that utilizes a multi-agent deep\nreinforcement learning algorithm to learn load characteristics of different\ncommunities and make decisions based on this knowledge. In this model, the\nscheduling problem of the integrated energy system is transformed into a Markov\ndecision process and solved using a data-driven deep reinforcement learning\nalgorithm, which avoids the need for modeling complex energy coupling\nrelationships between multi-communities and multi-energy subsystems. The\nsimulation results show that the proposed method effectively captures the load\ncharacteristics of different communities and utilizes their complementary\nfeatures to coordinate reasonable energy interactions among them. This leads to\na reduction in wind curtailment rate from 16.3% to 0% and lowers the overall\noperating cost by 5445.6 Yuan, demonstrating significant economic and\nenvironmental benefits.",

          "description": "Multimodal large-scale pretraining has shown impressive performance for\nunstructured data including language, image, audio, and video. However, a\nprevalent real-world scenario involves the combination of structured data types\n(tabular, time-series) with unstructured data which has so far been\nunderstudied. To bridge this gap, we propose LANISTR, an attention-based\nframework to learn from LANguage, Image, and STRuctured data. The core of\nLANISTR's methodology is rooted in \\textit{masking-based} training applied\nacross both unimodal and multimodal levels. In particular, we introduce a new\nsimilarity-based multimodal masking loss that enables it to learn cross-modal\nrelations from large-scale multimodal data with missing modalities. On two\nreal-world datastes, MIMIC-IV (healthcare) and Amazon Product Review (retail),\nLANISTR demonstrates remarkable absolute improvements of 6.6\\% (AUROC) and up\nto 14\\% (accuracy) when fine-tuned on 0.1\\% and 0.01\\% of labeled data,\nrespectively, compared to the state-of-the-art alternatives.

          "description": "Most existing classical artificial neural networks (ANN) are designed as a\ntree structure to imitate neural networks. In this paper, we argue that the\nconnectivity of a tree is not sufficient to characterize a neural network. The\nnodes of the same level of a tree cannot be connected with each other, i.e.,\nthese neural unit cannot share information with each other, which is a major\ndrawback of ANN. Although ANN has been significantly improved in recent years\nto more complex structures, such as the directed acyclic graph (DAG), these\nmethods also have unidirectional and acyclic bias for ANN. In this paper, we\npropose a method to build a bidirectional complete graph for the nodes in the\nsame level of an ANN, which yokes the nodes of the same level to formulate a\nneural module. We call our model as YNN in short. YNN promotes the information\ntransfer significantly which obviously helps in improving the performance of\nthe method. Our YNN can imitate neural networks much better compared with the\ntraditional ANN. In this paper, we analyze the existing structural bias of ANN\nand propose a model YNN to efficiently eliminate such structural bias. In our\nmodel, nodes also carry out aggregation and transformation of features, and\nedges determine the flow of information. We further impose auxiliary sparsity\nconstraint to the distribution of connectedness, which promotes the learned\nstructure to focus on critical connections. Finally, based on the optimized\nstructure, we also design small neural module structure based on the minimum\ncut technique to reduce the computational burden of the YNN model. This\nlearning process is compatible with the existing networks and different tasks.\nThe obtained quantitative experimental results reflect that the learned\nconnectivity is superior to the traditional NN structure.",

          "description": "Graphs are omnipresent and GNNs are a powerful family of neural networks for\nlearning over graphs. Despite their popularity, scaling GNNs either by\ndeepening or widening suffers from prevalent issues of unhealthy gradients,\nover-smoothening, information squashing, which often lead to sub-standard\nperformance. In this work, we are interested in exploring a principled way to\nscale GNNs capacity without deepening or widening, which can improve its\nperformance across multiple small and large graphs. Motivated by the recent\nintriguing phenomenon of model soups, which suggest that fine-tuned weights of\nmultiple large-language pre-trained models can be merged to a better minima, we\nargue to exploit the fundamentals of model soups to mitigate the aforementioned\nissues of memory bottleneck and trainability during GNNs scaling. More\nspecifically, we propose not to deepen or widen current GNNs, but instead\npresent a data-centric perspective of model soups tailored for GNNs, i.e., to\nbuild powerful GNNs. By dividing giant graph data, we build multiple\nindependently and parallelly trained weaker GNNs (soup ingredient) without any\nintermediate communication, and combine their strength using a greedy\ninterpolation soup procedure to achieve state-of-the-art performance. Compared\nto concurrent distributed GNN training works such as Jiong et. al. 2023, we\ntrain each soup ingredient by sampling different subgraphs per epoch and their\nrespective sub-models are merged only after being fully trained (rather than\nintermediately so). Moreover, we provide a wide variety of model soup\npreparation techniques by leveraging state-of-the-art graph sampling and graph\npartitioning approaches that can handle large graphs.

          "description": "The rapid growth of deep learning (DL) has spurred interest in enhancing\nlog-based anomaly detection. This approach aims to extract meaning from log\nevents (log message templates) and develop advanced DL models for anomaly\ndetection. However, these DL methods face challenges like heavy reliance on\ntraining data, labels, and computational resources due to model complexity. In\ncontrast, traditional machine learning and data mining techniques are less\ndata-dependent and more efficient but less effective than DL. To make log-based\nanomaly detection more practical, the goal is to enhance traditional techniques\nto match DL's effectiveness. Previous research in a different domain (linking\nquestions on Stack Overflow) suggests that optimized traditional techniques can\nrival state-of-the-art DL methods. Drawing inspiration from this concept, we\nconducted an empirical study. We optimized the unsupervised PCA (Principal\nComponent Analysis), a traditional technique, by incorporating lightweight\nsemantic-based log representation. This addresses the issue of unseen log\nevents in training data, enhancing log representation. Our study compared seven\nlog-based anomaly detection methods, including four DL-based, two traditional,\nand the optimized PCA technique, using public and industrial datasets. Results\nindicate that the optimized unsupervised PCA technique achieves similar\neffectiveness to advanced supervised/semi-supervised DL methods while being\nmore stable with limited training data and resource-efficient.

As with most data-driven systems, DRL\nsystems can exhibit undesirable behaviors due to environmental drifts, which\noften occur in constantly-changing production settings. Continual Learning (CL)\nis the inherent self-healing approach for adapting the DRL agent in response to\nthe environment's conditions shifts. However, successive shifts of considerable\nmagnitude may cause the production environment to drift from its original\nstate. Recent studies have shown that these environmental drifts tend to drive\nCL into long, or even unsuccessful, healing cycles, which arise from\ninefficiencies such as catastrophic forgetting, warm-starting failure, and slow\nconvergence. In this paper, we propose Dr. DRL, an effective self-healing\napproach for DRL systems that integrates a novel mechanism of intentional\nforgetting into vanilla CL to overcome its main issues. Dr. DRL deliberately\nerases the DRL system's minor behaviors to systematically prioritize the\nadaptation of the key problem-solving skills. Using well-established DRL\nalgorithms, Dr. DRL is compared with vanilla CL on various drifted\nenvironments. Dr. DRL is able to reduce, on average, the healing time and\nfine-tuning episodes by, respectively, 18.74% and 17.72%. Dr. DRL successfully\nhelps agents to adapt to 19.63% of drifted environments left unsolved by\nvanilla CL while maintaining and even enhancing by up to 45% the obtained\nrewards for drifted environments that are resolved by both approaches.",

          "description": "Accurate classification of white blood cells in peripheral blood is essential\nfor diagnosing hematological diseases. Due to constantly evolving clinical\nsettings, data sources, and disease classifications, it is necessary to update\nmachine learning classification models regularly for practical real-world use.\nSuch models significantly benefit from sequentially learning from incoming data\nstreams without forgetting previously acquired knowledge. However, models can\nsuffer from catastrophic forgetting, causing a drop in performance on previous\ntasks when fine-tuned on new data. Here, we propose a rehearsal-based continual\nlearning approach for class incremental and domain incremental scenarios in\nwhite blood cell classification. To choose representative samples from previous\ntasks, we employ exemplar set selection based on the model's predictions. This\ninvolves selecting the most confident samples and the most challenging samples\nidentified through uncertainty estimation of the model. We thoroughly evaluated\nour proposed approach on three white blood cell classification datasets that\ndiffer in color, resolution, and class composition, including scenarios where\nnew domains or new classes are introduced to the model with every task. We also\ntest a long class incremental experiment with both new domains and new classes.\nOur results demonstrate that our approach outperforms established baselines in\ncontinual learning, including existing iCaRL and EWC methods for classifying\nwhite blood cells in cross-domain environments.",

          "description": "Variational Information Pursuit (V-IP) is a framework for making\ninterpretable predictions by design by sequentially selecting a short chain of\ntask-relevant, user-defined and interpretable queries about the data that are\nmost informative for the task. While this allows for built-in interpretability\nin predictive models, applying V-IP to any task requires data samples with\ndense concept-labeling by domain experts, limiting the application of V-IP to\nsmall-scale tasks where manual data annotation is feasible. In this work, we\nextend the V-IP framework with Foundational Models (FMs) to address this\nlimitation. More specifically, we use a two-step process, by first leveraging\nLarge Language Models (LLMs) to generate a sufficiently large candidate set of\ntask-relevant interpretable concepts, then using Large Multimodal Models to\nannotate each data sample by semantic similarity with each concept in the\ngenerated concept set. While other interpretable-by-design frameworks such as\nConcept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) require an additional step of removing\nrepetitive and non-discriminative concepts to have good interpretability and\ntest performance, we mathematically and empirically justify that, with a\nsufficiently informative and task-relevant query (concept) set, the proposed\nFM+V-IP method does not require any type of concept filtering. In addition, we\nshow that FM+V-IP with LLM generated concepts can achieve better test\nperformance than V-IP with human annotated concepts, demonstrating the\neffectiveness of LLMs at generating efficient query sets. Finally, when\ncompared to other interpretable-by-design frameworks such as CBMs, FM+V-IP can\nachieve competitive test performance using fewer number of concepts/queries in\nboth cases with filtered or unfiltered concept sets.",

Omics-based cancer\nsubtyping has emerged as a revolutionary approach, as different level of omics\nrecords the biochemical products of multistep processes in cancers. This paper\nfocuses on fully exploiting the potential of multi-omics data to improve cancer\nsubtyping outcomes, and hence developed MoCLIM, a representation learning\nframework. MoCLIM independently extracts the informative features from distinct\nomics modalities. Using a unified representation informed by contrastive\nlearning of different omics modalities, we can well-cluster the subtypes, given\ncancer, into a lower latent space. This contrast can be interpreted as a\nprojection of inter-omics inference observed in biological networks.\nExperimental results on six cancer datasets demonstrate that our approach\nsignificantly improves data fit and subtyping performance in fewer\nhigh-dimensional cancer instances.

          "description": "Federated Learning (FL) aggregates locally trained models from individual\nclients to construct a global model. While FL enables learning a model with\ndata privacy, it often suffers from significant performance degradation when\nclient data distributions are heterogeneous. Many previous FL algorithms have\naddressed this issue by introducing various proximal restrictions. These\nrestrictions aim to encourage global alignment by constraining the deviation of\nlocal learning from the global objective. However, they inherently limit local\nlearning by interfering with the original local objectives. Recently, an\nalternative approach has emerged to improve local learning generality. By\nobtaining local models within a smooth loss landscape, this approach mitigates\nconflicts among different local objectives of the clients. Yet, it does not\nensure stable global alignment, as local learning does not take the global\nobjective into account. In this study, we propose Federated Stability on\nLearning (FedSoL), which combines both the concepts of global alignment and\nlocal generality. In FedSoL, the local learning seeks a parameter region robust\nagainst proximal perturbations. This strategy introduces an implicit proximal\nrestriction effect in local learning while maintaining the original local\nobjective for parameter update. Our experiments show that FedSoL consistently\nachieves state-of-the-art performance on various setups.",

More specifically, we develop a\nmotion planning model based on Time To Collision (TTC), which enables a\nquadrotor UAV to navigate around obstacles while ensuring the manipulator's\nreachability. Additionally, we utilize a model-based Q-learning model to\nindependently track and control the desired trajectory of the manipulator's\nend-effector, given an arbitrary baseline trajectory for the UAV platform. Such\na combination enables a variety of actuation tasks such as high-altitude\nwelding, structural monitoring and repair, battery replacement, gutter\ncleaning, sky scrapper cleaning, and power line maintenance in hard-to-reach\nand risky environments while retaining compatibility with flight control\nfirmware. Our RL-based control mechanism results in a robust control strategy\nthat can handle uncertainties in the motion of the UAV, offering promising\nperformance. Specifically, our method achieves 92\\% accuracy in terms of\naverage displacement error (i.e. the mean distance between the target and\nobtained trajectory points) using Q-learning with 15,000 episodes",

In this paper, we study the local\ndifferential privacy guarantees of discrete-valued mechanisms with finite\noutput space through the lens of $f$-differential privacy (DP). More\nspecifically, we advance the existing literature by deriving tight $f$-DP\nguarantees for a variety of discrete-valued mechanisms, including the binomial\nnoise and the binomial mechanisms that are proposed for privacy preservation,\nand the sign-based methods that are proposed for data compression, in\nclosed-form expressions. We further investigate the amplification in privacy by\nsparsification and propose a ternary stochastic compressor. By leveraging\ncompression for privacy amplification, we improve the existing methods by\nremoving the dependency of accuracy (in terms of mean square error) on\ncommunication cost in the popular use case of distributed mean estimation,\ntherefore breaking the three-way tradeoff between privacy, communication, and\naccuracy.

          "description": "Recently, foundation models have exhibited remarkable advancements in\nmulti-modal learning. These models, equipped with millions (or billions) of\nparameters, typically require a substantial amount of data for finetuning.\nHowever, collecting and centralizing training data from diverse sectors becomes\nchallenging due to distinct privacy regulations. Federated Learning (FL)\nemerges as a promising solution, enabling multiple clients to collaboratively\ntrain neural networks without centralizing their local data. To alleviate\nclient computation burdens and communication overheads, previous works have\nadapted Parameter-efficient Finetuning (PEFT) methods for FL. Hereby, only a\nsmall fraction of the model parameters are optimized and communicated during\nfederated communications. Nevertheless, most previous works have focused on a\nsingle modality and neglected one common phenomenon, i.e., the presence of data\nheterogeneity across the clients. Therefore, in this work, we propose a\nfinetuning framework tailored to heterogeneous multi-modal FL, called Federated\nDual-Aadapter Teacher (FedDAT). Specifically, our approach leverages a\nDual-Adapter Teacher (DAT) to address data heterogeneity by regularizing the\nclient local updates and applying Mutual Knowledge Distillation (MKD) for an\nefficient knowledge transfer. FedDAT is the first approach that enables an\nefficient distributed finetuning of foundation models for a variety of\nheterogeneous Vision-Language tasks. To demonstrate its effectiveness, we\nconduct extensive experiments on four multi-modality FL benchmarks with\ndifferent types of data heterogeneity, where FedDAT substantially outperforms\nthe existing centralized PEFT methods adapted for FL.",

Alternatively, a promising approach utilizes\ngenerative methods to handle the tracer distribution changes to assist existing\nregistration methods. To improve frame-wise registration and parametric\nquantification, we propose a Temporally and Anatomically Informed Generative\nAdversarial Network (TAI-GAN) to transform the early frames into the late\nreference frame using an all-to-one mapping. Specifically, a feature-wise\nlinear modulation layer encodes channel-wise parameters generated from temporal\ntracer kinetics information, and rough cardiac segmentations with local shifts\nserve as the anatomical information.

Although previous methods\nproduce realistic images, they suffer from unstable training or degenerate\nsolutions where the 3D geometry is unnatural.

To solve this\nproblem, we propose to approximate the background as a spherical surface and\nrepresent a scene as a union of the foreground placed in the sphere and the\nthin spherical background. It reduces the degree of freedom in the background\nfield. Accordingly, we modify the volume rendering equation and incorporate\ndedicated constraints to design a novel 3D-aware GAN framework named BallGAN.\nBallGAN has multiple advantages as follows. 1) It produces more reasonable 3D\ngeometry; the images of a scene across different viewpoints have better\nphotometric consistency and fidelity than the state-of-the-art methods. 2) The\ntraining becomes much more stable. 3) The foreground can be separately rendered\non top of different arbitrary backgrounds.",

Existing cloth simulators\nproduce realistic cloth deformations that obey different types of boundary\nconditions. Nevertheless, their operational principle remains limited in\nseveral ways: They operate on explicit surface representations with a fixed\nspatial resolution, perform a series of discretised updates (which bounds their\ntemporal resolution), and require comparably large amounts of storage.\nMoreover, back-propagating gradients through the existing solvers is often not\nstraightforward, which poses additional challenges when integrating them into\nmodern neural architectures.

          "description": "Accurately estimating parameters in complex nonlinear systems is crucial\nacross scientific and engineering fields. We present a novel approach for\nparameter estimation using a neural network with the Huber loss function. This\nmethod taps into deep learning's abilities to uncover parameters governing\nintricate behaviors in nonlinear equations. We validate our approach using\nsynthetic data and predefined functions that model system dynamics. By training\nthe neural network with noisy time series data, it fine-tunes the Huber loss\nfunction to converge to accurate parameters. We apply our method to damped\noscillators, Van der Pol oscillators, Lotka-Volterra systems, and Lorenz\nsystems under multiplicative noise. The trained neural network accurately\nestimates parameters, evident from closely matching latent dynamics. Comparing\ntrue and estimated trajectories visually reinforces our method's precision and\nrobustness. Our study underscores the Huber loss-guided neural network as a\nversatile tool for parameter estimation, effectively uncovering complex\nrelationships in nonlinear systems. The method navigates noise and uncertainty\nadeptly, showcasing its adaptability to real-world challenges.",

However, these\nrecordings often suffer from degradation such as noise and reverberation, which\nnegatively impact the listening experience. Consequently, the necessity for\nmusic audio enhancement (referred to as music enhancement from this point\nonward), involving the transformation of degraded audio recordings into\npristine high-quality music, has surged to augment the auditory experience. To\naddress this issue, we propose a music enhancement system based on the\nConformer architecture that has demonstrated outstanding performance in speech\nenhancement tasks. Our approach explores the attention mechanisms of the\nConformer and examines their performance to discover the best approach for the\nmusic enhancement task. Our experimental results show that our proposed model\nachieves state-of-the-art performance on single-stem music enhancement.\nFurthermore, our system can perform general music enhancement with multi-track\nmixtures, which has not been examined in previous work.",

          "description": "Handling entirely unknown data is a challenge for any deployed classifier.\nClassification models are typically trained on a static pre-defined dataset and\nare kept in the dark for the open unassigned feature space. As a result, they\nstruggle to deal with out-of-distribution data during inference. Addressing\nthis task on the class-level is termed open-set recognition (OSR). However,\nmost OSR methods are inherently limited, as they train closed-set classifiers\nand only adapt the downstream predictions to OSR. This work presents LORD, a\nframework to Leverage Open-set Recognition by exploiting unknown Data. LORD\nexplicitly models open space during classifier training and provides a\nsystematic evaluation for such approaches. We identify three model-agnostic\ntraining strategies that exploit background data and applied them to\nwell-established classifiers. Due to LORD's extensive evaluation protocol, we\nconsistently demonstrate improved recognition of unknown data. The benchmarks\nfacilitate in-depth analysis across various requirement levels. To mitigate\ndependency on extensive and costly background datasets, we explore mixup as an\noff-the-shelf data generation technique. Our experiments highlight mixup's\neffectiveness as a substitute for background datasets. Lightweight constraints\non mixup synthesis further improve OSR performance.",

          "description": "This paper reports on the GENEA Challenge 2023, in which participating teams\nbuilt speech-driven gesture-generation systems using the same speech and motion\ndataset, followed by a joint evaluation. This year's challenge provided data on\nboth sides of a dyadic interaction, allowing teams to generate full-body motion\nfor an agent given its speech (text and audio) and the speech and motion of the\ninterlocutor. We evaluated 12 submissions and 2 baselines together with\nheld-out motion-capture data in several large-scale user studies. The studies\nfocused on three aspects: 1) the human-likeness of the motion, 2) the\nappropriateness of the motion for the agent's own speech whilst controlling for\nthe human-likeness of the motion, and 3) the appropriateness of the motion for\nthe behaviour of the interlocutor in the interaction, using a setup that\ncontrols for both the human-likeness of the motion and the agent's own speech.\nWe found a large span in human-likeness between challenge submissions, with a\nfew systems rated close to human mocap. Appropriateness seems far from being\nsolved, with most submissions performing in a narrow range slightly above\nchance, far behind natural motion. The effect of the interlocutor is even more\nsubtle, with submitted systems at best performing barely above chance.\nInterestingly, a dyadic system being highly appropriate for agent speech does\nnot necessarily imply high appropriateness for the interlocutor.

          "description": "CNNs have been widely applied for medical image analysis. However, limited\nmemory capacity is one of the most common drawbacks of processing\nhigh-resolution 3D volumetric data. 3D volumes are usually cropped or downsized\nfirst before processing, which can result in a loss of resolution, increase\nclass imbalance, and affect the performance of the segmentation algorithms. In\nthis paper, we propose an end-to-end deep learning approach called IP-UNet.\nIP-UNet is a UNet-based model that performs multi-class segmentation on\nIntensity Projection (IP) of 3D volumetric data instead of the memory-consuming\n3D volumes. IP-UNet uses limited memory capability for training without losing\nthe original 3D image resolution. We compare the performance of three models in\nterms of segmentation accuracy and computational cost: 1) Slice-by-slice 2D\nsegmentation of the CT scan images using a conventional 2D UNet model. 2)\nIP-UNet that operates on data obtained by merging the extracted Maximum\nIntensity Projection (MIP), Closest Vessel Projection (CVP), and Average\nIntensity Projection (AvgIP) representations of the source 3D volumes, then\napplying the UNet model on the output IP images. 3) 3D-UNet model directly\nreads the 3D volumes constructed from a series of CT scan images and outputs\nthe 3D volume of the predicted segmentation. We test the performance of these\nmethods on 3D volumetric images for automatic breast calcification detection.\nExperimental results show that IP-Unet can achieve similar segmentation\naccuracy with 3D-Unet but with much better performance. It reduces the training\ntime by 70\\% and memory consumption by 92\\%.",

          "description": "White matter bundle segmentation is a cornerstone of modern tractography to\nstudy the brain's structural connectivity in domains such as neurological\ndisorders, neurosurgery, and aging. In this study, we present FIESTA (FIbEr\nSegmentation in Tractography using Autoencoders), a reliable and robust, fully\nautomated, and easily semi-automatically calibrated pipeline based on deep\nautoencoders that can dissect and fully populate white matter bundles. This\npipeline is built upon previous works that demonstrated how autoencoders can be\nused successfully for streamline filtering, bundle segmentation, and streamline\ngeneration in tractography. Our proposed method improves bundle segmentation\ncoverage by recovering hard-to-track bundles with generative sampling through\nthe latent space seeding of the subject bundle and the atlas bundle. A latent\nspace of streamlines is learned using autoencoder-based modeling combined with\ncontrastive learning. Using an atlas of bundles in standard space (MNI), our\nproposed method segments new tractograms using the autoencoder latent distance\nbetween each tractogram streamline and its closest neighbor bundle in the atlas\nof bundles. Intra-subject bundle reliability is improved by recovering\nhard-to-track streamlines, using the autoencoder to generate new streamlines\nthat increase the spatial coverage of each bundle while remaining anatomically\ncorrect. Results show that our method is more reliable than state-of-the-art\nautomated virtual dissection methods such as RecoBundles, RecoBundlesX,\nTractSeg, White Matter Analysis and XTRACT. Our framework allows for the\ntransition from one anatomical bundle definition to another with marginal\ncalibration efforts.

We first probe the results\nfrom previous works on this setting. We show that the empirical risk defined in\nprevious works and matching the definition in the classical theory fails to\nsatisfy the uniform convergence property enjoyed in the classical setting for\nsome learnable classes. Moreover, we show that VC dimension generalization\nupper bounds in previous work are frequently infinite, even for\nfinite-dimensional POVM classes. To surmount the failure of the standard ERM to\nsatisfy uniform convergence, we define a new learning rule -- denoised ERM. We\nshow this to be a universal learning rule for POVM and probabilistically\nobserved concept classes, and the condition for it to satisfy uniform\nconvergence is finite fat shattering dimension of the class. We give\nquantitative sample complexity upper and lower bounds for learnability in terms\nof finite fat-shattering dimension and a notion of approximate finite\npartitionability into approximately jointly measurable subsets, which allow for\nsample reuse. We then show that finite fat shattering dimension implies finite\ncoverability by approximately jointly measurable subsets, leading to our\nmatching conditions.

          "description": "Common explanations for shortcut learning assume that the shortcut improves\nprediction under the training distribution but not in the test distribution.\nThus, models trained via the typical gradient-based optimization of\ncross-entropy, which we call default-ERM, utilize the shortcut. However, even\nwhen the stable feature determines the label in the training distribution and\nthe shortcut does not provide any additional information, like in perception\ntasks, default-ERM still exhibits shortcut learning. Why are such solutions\npreferred when the loss for default-ERM can be driven to zero using the stable\nfeature alone? By studying a linear perception task, we show that default-ERM's\npreference for maximizing the margin leads to models that depend more on the\nshortcut than the stable feature, even without overparameterization. This\ninsight suggests that default-ERM's implicit inductive bias towards max-margin\nis unsuitable for perception tasks. Instead, we develop an inductive bias\ntoward uniform margins and show that this bias guarantees dependence only on\nthe perfect stable feature in the linear perception task. We develop loss\nfunctions that encourage uniform-margin solutions, called margin control\n(MARG-CTRL). MARG-CTRL mitigates shortcut learning on a variety of vision and\nlanguage tasks, showing that better inductive biases can remove the need for\nexpensive two-stage shortcut-mitigating methods in perception tasks.",

In response to this vital need, we introduce PromptBench, a robustness\nbenchmark designed to measure LLMs' resilience to adversarial prompts. This\nstudy uses a plethora of adversarial textual attacks targeting prompts across\nmultiple levels: character, word, sentence, and semantic. These prompts are\nthen employed in diverse tasks, such as sentiment analysis, natural language\ninference, reading comprehension, machine translation, and math\nproblem-solving. Our study generates 4,032 adversarial prompts, meticulously\nevaluated over 8 tasks and 13 datasets, with 567,084 test samples in total. Our\nfindings demonstrate that contemporary LLMs are vulnerable to adversarial\nprompts. Furthermore, we present comprehensive analysis to understand the\nmystery behind prompt robustness and its transferability. We then offer\ninsightful robustness analysis and pragmatic recommendations for prompt\ncomposition, beneficial to both researchers and everyday users. We make our\ncode, prompts, and methodologies to generate adversarial prompts publicly\naccessible, thereby enabling and encouraging collaborative exploration in this\npivotal field: https://github.com/microsoft/promptbench.",

While these approximations respect the\nsymplectic nature of Hamiltonian systems, linear basis approximations can\nsuffer from slowly decaying Kolmogorov $N$-width, especially in wave-type\nproblems, which then requires a large basis size. We propose two different\nmodel reduction methods based on recently developed quadratic manifolds, each\npresenting its own advantages and limitations. The addition of quadratic terms\nto the state approximation, which sits at the heart of the proposed\nmethodologies, enables us to better represent intrinsic low-dimensionality in\nthe problem at hand.

          "description": "Deep reinforcement learning (DRL), leveraging Deep Learning (DL) in\nreinforcement learning, has shown significant potential in achieving\nhuman-level autonomy in a wide range of domains, including robotics, computer\nvision, and computer games. This potential justifies the enthusiasm and growing\ninterest in DRL in both academia and industry. However, the community currently\nfocuses mostly on the development phase of DRL systems, with little attention\ndevoted to DRL deployment. In this paper, we propose an empirical study on\nStack Overflow (SO), the most popular Q&A forum for developers, to uncover and\nunderstand the challenges practitioners faced when deploying DRL systems.\nSpecifically, we categorized relevant SO posts by deployment platforms:\nserver/cloud, mobile/embedded system, browser, and game engine. After filtering\nand manual analysis, we examined 357 SO posts about DRL deployment,\ninvestigated the current state, and identified the challenges related to\ndeploying DRL systems. Then, we investigate the prevalence and difficulty of\nthese challenges. Results show that the general interest in DRL deployment is\ngrowing, confirming the study's relevance and importance. Results also show\nthat DRL deployment is more difficult than other DRL issues. Additionally, we\nbuilt a taxonomy of 31 unique challenges in deploying DRL to different\nplatforms. On all platforms, RL environment-related challenges are the most\npopular, and communication-related challenges are the most difficult among\npractitioners. We hope our study inspires future research and helps the\ncommunity overcome the most common and difficult challenges practitioners face\nwhen deploying DRL systems.",

In such cases researchers need to infer gender from\nreadily available information, primarily from persons' names.

          "description": "Sparsity is a highly desired feature in deep neural networks (DNNs) since it\nensures numerical efficiency, improves the interpretability of models (due to\nthe smaller number of relevant features), and robustness. In machine learning\napproaches based on linear models, it is well known that there exists a\nconnecting path between the sparsest solution in terms of the $\\ell^1$ norm\n(i.e., zero weights) and the non-regularized solution, which is called the\nregularization path. Very recently, there was a first attempt to extend the\nconcept of regularization paths to DNNs by means of treating the empirical loss\nand sparsity ($\\ell^1$ norm) as two conflicting criteria and solving the\nresulting multiobjective optimization problem. However, due to the\nnon-smoothness of the $\\ell^1$ norm and the high number of parameters, this\napproach is not very efficient from a computational perspective. To overcome\nthis limitation, we present an algorithm that allows for the approximation of\nthe entire Pareto front for the above-mentioned objectives in a very efficient\nmanner. We present numerical examples using both deterministic and stochastic\ngradients. We furthermore demonstrate that knowledge of the regularization path\nallows for a well-generalizing network parametrization.",

The time series anomaly detection\ncommunity currently lacks explicit tooling and processes to model and reliably\ndetect anomalies in these settings. We address this gap by introducing a novel\ngenerative procedure for creating benchmark datasets comprising of low-count\ntime series with anomalous segments.

          "description": "Synthetic electronic health records (EHRs) that are both realistic and\npreserve privacy can serve as an alternative to real EHRs for machine learning\n(ML) modeling and statistical analysis. However, generating high-fidelity and\ngranular electronic health record (EHR) data in its original,\nhighly-dimensional form poses challenges for existing methods due to the\ncomplexities inherent in high-dimensional data. In this paper, we propose\nHierarchical Autoregressive Language mOdel (HALO) for generating longitudinal\nhigh-dimensional EHR, which preserve the statistical properties of real EHR and\ncan be used to train accurate ML models without privacy concerns. Our HALO\nmethod, designed as a hierarchical autoregressive model, generates a\nprobability density function of medical codes, clinical visits, and patient\nrecords, allowing for the generation of realistic EHR data in its original,\nunaggregated form without the need for variable selection or aggregation.\nAdditionally, our model also produces high-quality continuous variables in a\nlongitudinal and probabilistic manner. We conducted extensive experiments and\ndemonstrate that HALO can generate high-fidelity EHR data with high-dimensional\ndisease code probabilities (d > 10,000), disease co-occurrence probabilities\nwithin visits (d > 1,000,000), and conditional probabilities across consecutive\nvisits (d > 5,000,000) and achieve above 0.9 R2 correlation in comparison to\nreal EHR data. This performance then enables downstream ML models trained on\nits synthetic data to achieve comparable accuracy to models trained on real\ndata (0.938 AUROC with HALO data vs. 0.943 with real data). Finally, using a\ncombination of real and synthetic data enhances the accuracy of ML models\nbeyond that achieved by using only real EHR data.",

Recent advances in mesh neural networks turn to remeshing and\npush the boundary of pioneer methods that solely take the raw meshes as input.\nAlthough the remeshing offers a regular topology that significantly facilitates\nthe design of mesh network architectures, features extracted from such remeshed\nproxies may struggle to retain the underlying geometry faithfully, limiting the\nsubsequent neural network's capacity. To address this issue, we propose\nSieveNet, a novel paradigm that takes into account both the regular topology\nand the exact geometry. Specifically, this method utilizes structured mesh\ntopology from remeshing and accurate geometric information from\ndistortion-aware point sampling on the surface of the original mesh.\nFurthermore, our method eliminates the need for hand-crafted feature\nengineering and can leverage off-the-shelf network architectures such as the\nvision transformer. Comprehensive experimental results on classification and\nsegmentation tasks well demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our\nmethod.",

          "description": "Digitalizing real-world analog signals typically involves sampling in time\nand discretizing in amplitude. Subsequent signal reconstructions inevitably\nincur an error that depends on the amplitude resolution and the temporal\ndensity of the acquired samples. From an implementation viewpoint, consistent\nsignal reconstruction methods have proven a profitable error-rate decay as the\nsampling rate increases. Despite that, these results are obtained under offline\nsettings. Therefore, a research gap exists regarding methods for consistent\nsignal reconstruction from data streams. This paper presents a method that\nconsistently reconstructs streamed multivariate time series of quantization\nintervals under a zero-delay response requirement. On the other hand, previous\nwork has shown that the temporal dependencies within univariate time series can\nbe exploited to reduce the roughness of zero-delay signal reconstructions. This\nwork shows that the spatiotemporal dependencies within multivariate time series\ncan also be exploited to achieve improved results. Specifically, the\nspatiotemporal dependencies of the multivariate time series are learned, with\nthe assistance of a recurrent neural network, to reduce the roughness of the\nsignal reconstruction on average while ensuring consistency.

          "description": "Customer lifetime value (LTV) prediction is essential for mobile game\npublishers trying to optimize the advertising investment for each user\nacquisition based on the estimated worth. In mobile games, deploying\nmicrotransactions is a simple yet effective monetization strategy, which\nattracts a tiny group of game whales who splurge on in-game purchases. The\npresence of such game whales may impede the practicality of existing LTV\nprediction models, since game whales' purchase behaviours always exhibit varied\ndistribution from general users. Consequently, identifying game whales can open\nup new opportunities to improve the accuracy of LTV prediction models. However,\nlittle attention has been paid to applying game whale detection in LTV\nprediction, and existing works are mainly specialized for the long-term LTV\nprediction with the assumption that the high-quality user features are\navailable, which is not applicable in the UA stage. In this paper, we propose\nExpLTV, a novel multi-task framework to perform LTV prediction and game whale\ndetection in a unified way. In ExpLTV, we first innovatively design a deep\nneural network-based game whale detector that can not only infer the intrinsic\norder in accordance with monetary value, but also precisely identify high\nspenders (i.e., game whales) and low spenders. Then, by treating the game whale\ndetector as a gating network to decide the different mixture patterns of LTV\nexperts assembling, we can thoroughly leverage the shared information and\nscenario-specific information (i.e., game whales modelling and low spenders\nmodelling). Finally, instead of separately designing a purchase rate estimator\nfor two tasks, we design a shared estimator that can preserve the inner task\nrelationships. The superiority of ExpLTV is further validated via extensive\nexperiments on three industrial datasets.",

          "description": "Post-training quantization attracts increasing attention due to its\nconvenience in deploying quantized neural networks. Although\nrounding-to-nearest remains the prevailing method for DNN quantization, prior\nresearch has demonstrated its suboptimal nature when applied to weight\nquantization. They propose optimizing weight rounding schemes by leveraging\noutput error rather than the traditional weight quantization error. Our study\nreveals that similar rounding challenges also extend to activation\nquantization. Despite the easy generalization, the challenges lie in the\ndynamic nature of activation. Adaptive rounding is expected for varying\nactivations and the method is subjected to runtime overhead. To tackle this, we\npropose the AQuant quantization framework with a novel perspective to reduce\noutput error by adjusting rounding schemes of activations. Instead of using the\nconstant rounding border 0.5 of the rounding-to-nearest operation, we make the\nborder become a function w.r.t. the activation value to change the activation\nrounding by the adaptive border. To deal with the runtime overhead, we use a\ncoarse-grained version of the border function. Finally, we introduce our\nframework to optimize the border function. Extensive experiments show that\nAQuant achieves notable improvements compared to state-of-the-art works and\npushes the accuracy of ResNet-18 up to 60.31% under the 2-bit weight and\nactivation quantization.",

          "description": "Robotics and automation offer massive accelerations for solving intractable,\nmultivariate scientific problems such as materials discovery, but the available\nsearch spaces can be dauntingly large. Bayesian optimization (BO) has emerged\nas a popular sample-efficient optimization engine, thriving in tasks where no\nanalytic form of the target function/property is known. Here we exploit expert\nhuman knowledge in the form of hypotheses to direct Bayesian searches more\nquickly to promising regions of chemical space. Previous methods have used\nunderlying distributions derived from existing experimental measurements, which\nis unfeasible for new, unexplored scientific tasks. Also, such distributions\ncannot capture intricate hypotheses. Our proposed method, which we call HypBO,\nuses expert human hypotheses to generate an improved seed of samples.\nUnpromising seeds are automatically discounted, while promising seeds are used\nto augment the surrogate model data, thus achieving better-informed sampling.\nThis process continues in a global versus local search fashion, organized in a\nbilevel optimization framework. We validate the performance of our method on a\nrange of synthetic functions and demonstrate its practical utility on a real\nchemical design task where the use of expert hypotheses accelerates the search\nperformance significantly.",

To achieve reliability, we\nintroduce the Comprehensive Assessment of Language Model bias (CALM), a\nbenchmark dataset to quantify bias in LMs across three tasks. We integrate 16\nexisting datasets across different domains, such as Wikipedia and news\narticles, to filter 224 templates from which we construct a dataset of 78,400\nexamples. We compare the diversity of CALM with prior datasets on metrics such\nas average semantic similarity, and variation in template length, and test the\nsensitivity to small perturbations. We show that our dataset is more diverse\nand reliable than previous datasets, thus better capture the breadth of\nlinguistic variation required to reliably evaluate model bias. We evaluate 20\nlarge language models including six prominent families of LMs such as Llama-2.\nIn two LM series, OPT and Bloom, we found that larger parameter models are more\nbiased than lower parameter models. We found the T0 series of models to be the\nleast biased. Furthermore, we noticed a tradeoff between gender and racial bias\nwith increasing model size in some model series.

          "description": "We present a novel defense, against backdoor attacks on Deep Neural Networks\n(DNNs), wherein adversaries covertly implant malicious behaviors (backdoors)\ninto DNNs. Our defense falls within the category of post-development defenses\nthat operate independently of how the model was generated. The proposed defense\nis built upon a novel reverse engineering approach that can directly extract\nbackdoor functionality of a given backdoored model to a backdoor expert model.\nThe approach is straightforward -- finetuning the backdoored model over a small\nset of intentionally mislabeled clean samples, such that it unlearns the normal\nfunctionality while still preserving the backdoor functionality, and thus\nresulting in a model (dubbed a backdoor expert model) that can only recognize\nbackdoor inputs. Based on the extracted backdoor expert model, we show the\nfeasibility of devising highly accurate backdoor input detectors that filter\nout the backdoor inputs during model inference. Further augmented by an\nensemble strategy with a finetuned auxiliary model, our defense, BaDExpert\n(Backdoor Input Detection with Backdoor Expert), effectively mitigates 16 SOTA\nbackdoor attacks while minimally impacting clean utility. The effectiveness of\nBaDExpert has been verified on multiple datasets (CIFAR10, GTSRB and ImageNet)\nacross various model architectures (ResNet, VGG, MobileNetV2 and Vision\nTransformer).",

          "description": "Imitation Learning (IL) is an important paradigm within the broader\nreinforcement learning (RL) methodology. Unlike most of RL, it does not assume\navailability of reward-feedback. Reward inference and shaping are known to be\ndifficult and error-prone methods particularly when the demonstration data\ncomes from human experts. Classical methods such as behavioral cloning and\ninverse reinforcement learning are highly sensitive to estimation errors, a\nproblem that is particularly acute in continuous state space problems.\nMeanwhile, state-of-the-art IL algorithms convert behavioral policy learning\nproblems into distribution-matching problems which often require additional\nonline interaction data to be effective. In this paper, we consider the problem\nof imitation learning in continuous state space environments based solely on\nobserved behavior, without access to transition dynamics information, reward\nstructure, or, most importantly, any additional interactions with the\nenvironment. Our approach is based on the Markov balance equation and\nintroduces a novel conditional kernel density estimation-based imitation\nlearning framework. It involves estimating the environment's transition\ndynamics using conditional kernel density estimators and seeks to satisfy the\nprobabilistic balance equations for the environment. We establish that our\nestimators satisfy basic asymptotic consistency requirements. Through a series\nof numerical experiments on continuous state benchmark environments, we show\nconsistently superior empirical performance over many state-of-the-art IL\nalgorithms.",

          "description": "We explain how to use diffusion models to learn inverse renormalization group\nflows of statistical and quantum field theories. Diffusion models are a class\nof machine learning models which have been used to generate samples from\ncomplex distributions, such as the distribution of natural images, by learning\nthe inverse process to a diffusion process which adds noise to the data until\nthe distribution of the data is pure noise. Nonperturbative renormalization\ngroup schemes can naturally be written as diffusion processes in the space of\nfields. We combine these observations in a concrete framework for building\nML-based models for studying field theories, in which the models learn the\ninverse process to an explicitly-specified renormalization group scheme. We\ndetail how these models define a class of adaptive bridge (or parallel\ntempering) samplers for lattice field theory. Because renormalization group\nschemes have a physical meaning, we provide explicit prescriptions for how to\ncompare results derived from models associated to several different\nrenormalization group schemes of interest. We also explain how to use diffusion\nmodels in a variational method to find ground states of quantum systems. We\napply some of our methods to numerically find RG flows of interacting\nstatistical field theories. From the perspective of machine learning, our work\nprovides an interpretation of multiscale diffusion models, and gives\nphysically-inspired suggestions for diffusion models which should have novel\nproperties.",

Although some previous studies have explored the unsupervised\nfine-tuning of CLIP, they often rely on prior knowledge in the form of class\nnames associated with ground truth labels. In this paper, we delve into a\nrealistic unsupervised fine-tuning scenario by assuming that the unlabeled data\nmight contain out-of-distribution samples from unknown classes. Furthermore, we\nemphasize the importance of simultaneously enhancing out-of-distribution\ndetection capabilities alongside the recognition of instances associated with\npredefined class labels.\n\nTo tackle this problem, we present a simple, efficient, and effective\nfine-tuning approach called Universal Entropy Optimization (UEO).

Apart from optimizing the textual prompts, UEO also incorporates\noptimization of channel-wise affine transformations within the visual branch of\nCLIP.

          "description": "Robot control using reinforcement learning has become popular, but its\nlearning process generally terminates halfway through an episode for safety and\ntime-saving reasons. This study addresses the problem of the most popular\nexception handling that temporal-difference (TD) learning performs at such\ntermination. That is, by forcibly assuming zero value after termination,\nunintentionally implicit underestimation or overestimation occurs, depending on\nthe reward design in the normal states. When the episode is terminated due to\ntask failure, the failure may be highly valued with the unintentional\noverestimation, and the wrong policy may be acquired. Although this problem can\nbe avoided by paying attention to the reward design, it is essential in\npractical use of TD learning to review the exception handling at termination.\nThis paper therefore proposes a method to intentionally underestimate the value\nafter termination to avoid learning failures due to the unintentional\noverestimation. In addition, the degree of underestimation is adjusted\naccording to the degree of stationarity at termination, thereby preventing\nexcessive exploration due to the intentional underestimation. Simulations and\nreal robot experiments showed that the proposed method can stably obtain the\noptimal policies for various tasks and reward designs.\nhttps://youtu.be/AxXr8uFOe7M",

Although reinforcement learning (RL)-based decision-making\nscheme is promising to handle urban driving scenarios, it suffers from low\nsample efficiency and poor adaptability. In this paper, we propose Scene-Rep\nTransformer to improve the RL decision-making capabilities with better scene\nrepresentation encoding and sequential predictive latent distillation.\nSpecifically, a multi-stage Transformer (MST) encoder is constructed to model\nnot only the interaction awareness between the ego vehicle and its neighbors\nbut also intention awareness between the agents and their candidate routes. A\nsequential latent Transformer (SLT) with self-supervised learning objectives is\nemployed to distill the future predictive information into the latent scene\nrepresentation, in order to reduce the exploration space and speed up training.\nThe final decision-making module based on soft actor-critic (SAC) takes as\ninput the refined latent scene representation from the Scene-Rep Transformer\nand outputs driving actions. The framework is validated in five challenging\nsimulated urban scenarios with dense traffic, and its performance is manifested\nquantitatively by the substantial improvements in data efficiency and\nperformance in terms of success rate, safety, and efficiency.

          "description": "Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) have emerged as a hardware efficient\narchitecture for classification tasks. The challenge of spike-based encoding\nhas been the lack of a universal training mechanism performed entirely using\nspikes. There have been several attempts to adopt the powerful backpropagation\n(BP) technique used in non-spiking artificial neural networks (ANN): (1) SNNs\ncan be trained by externally computed numerical gradients. (2) A major\nadvancement towards native spike-based learning has been the use of approximate\nBackpropagation using spike-time dependent plasticity (STDP) with phased\nforward/backward passes. However, the transfer of information between such\nphases for gradient and weight update calculation necessitates external memory\nand computational access. This is a challenge for standard neuromorphic\nhardware implementations. In this paper, we propose a stochastic SNN based\nBack-Prop (SSNN-BP) algorithm that utilizes a composite neuron to\nsimultaneously compute the forward pass activations and backward pass gradients\nexplicitly with spikes. Although signed gradient values are a challenge for\nspike-based representation, we tackle this by splitting the gradient signal\ninto positive and negative streams. We show that our method approaches BP ANN\nbaseline with sufficiently long spike-trains. Finally, we show that the\nwell-performing softmax cross-entropy loss function can be implemented through\ninhibitory lateral connections enforcing a Winner Take All (WTA) rule. Our SNN\nwith a 2-layer network shows excellent generalization through comparable\nperformance to ANNs with equivalent architecture and regularization parameters\non static image datasets like MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, Extended MNIST, and\ntemporally encoded image datasets like Neuromorphic MNIST datasets. Thus,\nSSNN-BP enables BP compatible with purely spike-based neuromorphic hardware.",

          "description": "Several earlier studies have shown impressive control performance in complex\nrobotic systems by designing the controller using a neural network and training\nit with model-free reinforcement learning. However, these outstanding\ncontrollers with natural motion style and high task performance are developed\nthrough extensive reward engineering, which is a highly laborious and\ntime-consuming process of designing numerous reward terms and determining\nsuitable reward coefficients. In this work, we propose a novel reinforcement\nlearning framework for training neural network controllers for complex robotic\nsystems consisting of both rewards and constraints. To let the engineers\nappropriately reflect their intent to constraints and handle them with minimal\ncomputation overhead, two constraint types and an efficient policy optimization\nalgorithm are suggested. The learning framework is applied to train locomotion\ncontrollers for several legged robots with different morphology and physical\nattributes to traverse challenging terrains. Extensive simulation and\nreal-world experiments demonstrate that performant controllers can be trained\nwith significantly less reward engineering, by tuning only a single reward\ncoefficient. Furthermore, a more straightforward and intuitive engineering\nprocess can be utilized, thanks to the interpretability and generalizability of\nconstraints.

In this paper, we\nperform an empirical analysis of the behavior of PINN predictions outside their\ntraining domain. The primary goal is to investigate the scenarios in which a\nPINN can provide consistent predictions outside the training area.\nThereinafter, we assess whether the algorithmic setup of PINNs can influence\ntheir potential for generalization and showcase the respective effect on the\nprediction.

          "description": "Deep neural networks (NNs) are known for their high-prediction performances.\nHowever, NNs are prone to yield unreliable predictions when encountering\ncompletely new situations without indicating their uncertainty. Bayesian\nvariants of NNs (BNNs), such as Monte Carlo (MC) dropout BNNs, do provide\nuncertainty measures and simultaneously increase the prediction performance.\nThe only disadvantage of BNNs is their higher computation time during test time\nbecause they rely on a sampling approach. Here we present a single-shot MC\ndropout approximation that preserves the advantages of BNNs while being as fast\nas NNs. Our approach is based on moment propagation (MP) and allows to\nanalytically approximate the expected value and the variance of the MC dropout\nsignal for commonly used layers in NNs, i.e. convolution, max pooling, dense,\nsoftmax, and dropout layers. The MP approach can convert an NN into a BNN\nwithout re-training given the NN has been trained with standard dropout. We\nevaluate our approach on different benchmark datasets and a simulated toy\nexample in a classification and regression setting. We demonstrate that our\nsingle-shot MC dropout approximation resembles the point estimate and the\nuncertainty estimate of the predictive distribution that is achieved with an MC\napproach, while being fast enough for real-time deployments of BNNs.

          "description": "Offshore wind structures are subject to deterioration mechanisms throughout\ntheir operational lifetime. Even if the deterioration evolution of structural\nelements can be estimated through physics-based deterioration models, the\nuncertainties involved in the process hurdle the selection of lifecycle\nmanagement decisions. In this scenario, the collection of relevant information\nthrough an efficient monitoring system enables the reduction of uncertainties,\nultimately driving more optimal lifecycle decisions. However, a full monitoring\ninstrumentation implemented on all wind turbines in a farm might become\nunfeasible due to practical and economical constraints. Besides, certain load\nmonitoring systems often become defective after a few years of marine\nenvironment exposure. Addressing the aforementioned concerns, a farm-wide\nvirtual load monitoring scheme directed by a fleet-leader wind turbine offers\nan attractive solution. Fetched with data retrieved from a fully-instrumented\nwind turbine, a model can be trained and then deployed, thus yielding load\npredictions of non-fully monitored wind turbines, from which only standard data\nremains available. In this paper, we propose a virtual load monitoring\nframework formulated via Bayesian neural networks (BNNs) and we provide\nrelevant implementation details needed for the construction, training, and\ndeployment of BNN data-based virtual monitoring models. As opposed to their\ndeterministic counterparts, BNNs intrinsically announce the uncertainties\nassociated with generated load predictions and allow to detect inaccurate load\nestimations generated for non-fully monitored wind turbines. The proposed\nvirtual load monitoring is thoroughly tested through an experimental campaign\nin an operational offshore wind farm and the results demonstrate the\neffectiveness of BNN models for fleet-leader-based farm-wide virtual\nmonitoring.",

          "description": "With the growing use of machine learning (ML) models in critical domains such\nas finance and healthcare, the need to offer recourse for those adversely\naffected by the decisions of ML models has become more important; individuals\nought to be provided with recommendations on actions to take for improving\ntheir situation and thus receive a favorable decision. Prior work on sequential\nalgorithmic recourse -- which recommends a series of changes -- focuses on\naction feasibility and uses the proximity of feature changes to determine\naction costs. However, the uncertainties of feature changes and the risk of\nhigher than average costs in recourse have not been considered.

It is essential\nto incorporate risks when computing and evaluating recourse. We call the\nrecourse computed with such risk considerations as Safer Algorithmic Recourse\n(SafeAR). The objective is to empower people to choose a recourse based on\ntheir risk tolerance. In this work, we discuss and show how existing recourse\ndesiderata can fail to capture the risk of higher costs. We present a method to\ncompute recourse policies that consider variability in cost and connect\nalgorithmic recourse literature with risk-sensitive reinforcement learning. We\nalso adopt measures ``Value at Risk'' and ``Conditional Value at Risk'' from\nthe financial literature to summarize risk concisely. We apply our method to\ntwo real-world datasets and compare policies with different levels of\nrisk-aversion using risk measures and recourse desiderata (sparsity and\nproximity).",

          "description": "Nucleus image segmentation is a crucial step in the analysis, pathological\ndiagnosis, and classification, which heavily relies on the quality of nucleus\nsegmentation. However, the complexity of issues such as variations in nucleus\nsize, blurred nucleus contours, uneven staining, cell clustering, and\noverlapping cells poses significant challenges. Current methods for nucleus\nsegmentation primarily rely on nuclear morphology or contour-based approaches.\nNuclear morphology-based methods exhibit limited generalization ability and\nstruggle to effectively predict irregular-shaped nuclei, while contour-based\nextraction methods face challenges in accurately segmenting overlapping nuclei.\nTo address the aforementioned issues, we propose a dual-branch network using\nhybrid attention based residual U-blocks for nucleus instance segmentation. The\nnetwork simultaneously predicts target information and target contours.\nAdditionally, we introduce a post-processing method that combines the target\ninformation and target contours to distinguish overlapping nuclei and generate\nan instance segmentation image. Within the network, we propose a context fusion\nblock (CF-block) that effectively extracts and merges contextual information\nfrom the network. Extensive quantitative evaluations are conducted to assess\nthe performance of our method. Experimental results demonstrate the superior\nperformance of the proposed method compared to state-of-the-art approaches on\nthe BNS, MoNuSeg, CoNSeg, and CPM-17 datasets.",

          "description": "Lesion segmentation of ultrasound medical images based on deep learning\ntechniques is a widely used method for diagnosing diseases. Although there is a\nlarge amount of ultrasound image data in medical centers and other places,\nlabeled ultrasound datasets are a scarce resource, and it is likely that no\ndatasets are available for new tissues/organs. Transfer learning provides the\npossibility to solve this problem, but there are too many features in natural\nimages that are not related to the target domain. As a source domain, redundant\nfeatures that are not conducive to the task will be extracted. Migration\nbetween ultrasound images can avoid this problem, but there are few types of\npublic datasets, and it is difficult to find sufficiently similar source\ndomains. Compared with natural images, ultrasound images have less information,\nand there are fewer transferable features between different ultrasound images,\nwhich may cause negative transfer. To this end, a multi-source adversarial\ntransfer learning network for ultrasound image segmentation is proposed.\nSpecifically, to address the lack of annotations, the idea of adversarial\ntransfer learning is used to adaptively extract common features between a\ncertain pair of source and target domains, which provides the possibility to\nutilize unlabeled ultrasound data. To alleviate the lack of knowledge in a\nsingle source domain, multi-source transfer learning is adopted to fuse\nknowledge from multiple source domains. In order to ensure the effectiveness of\nthe fusion and maximize the use of precious data, a multi-source domain\nindependent strategy is also proposed to improve the estimation of the target\ndomain data distribution, which further increases the learning ability of the\nmulti-source adversarial migration learning network in multiple domains.",

          "description": "This paper asks whether current self-supervised learning methods, if\nsufficiently scaled up, would be able to reach human-level visual object\nrecognition capabilities with the same type and amount of visual experience\nhumans learn from. Previous work on this question only considered the scaling\nof data size. Here, we consider the simultaneous scaling of data size, model\nsize, and image resolution. We perform a scaling experiment with vision\ntransformers up to 633M parameters in size (ViT-H/14) trained with up to 5K\nhours of human-like video data (long, continuous, mostly egocentric videos)\nwith image resolutions of up to 476x476 pixels. The efficiency of masked\nautoencoders (MAEs) as a self-supervised learning algorithm makes it possible\nto run this scaling experiment on an unassuming academic budget. We find that\nit is feasible to reach human-level object recognition capacity at sub-human\nscales of model size, data size, and image size, if these factors are scaled up\nsimultaneously. To give a concrete example, we estimate that a 2.5B parameter\nViT model trained with 20K hours (2.3 years) of human-like video data with a\nspatial resolution of 952x952 pixels should be able to reach roughly\nhuman-level accuracy on ImageNet.

          "description": "Unsupervised domain adaptation (DA) with the aid of pseudo labeling\ntechniques has emerged as a crucial approach for domain-adaptive 3D object\ndetection. While effective, existing DA methods suffer from a substantial drop\nin performance when applied to a multi-class training setting, due to the\nco-existence of low-quality pseudo labels and class imbalance issues. In this\npaper, we address this challenge by proposing a novel ReDB framework tailored\nfor learning to detect all classes at once. Our approach produces Reliable,\nDiverse, and class-Balanced pseudo 3D boxes to iteratively guide the\nself-training on a distributionally different target domain. To alleviate\ndisruptions caused by the environmental discrepancy (e.g., beam numbers), the\nproposed cross-domain examination (CDE) assesses the correctness of pseudo\nlabels by copy-pasting target instances into a source environment and measuring\nthe prediction consistency. To reduce computational overhead and mitigate the\nobject shift (e.g., scales and point densities), we design an overlapped boxes\ncounting (OBC) metric that allows to uniformly downsample pseudo-labeled\nobjects across different geometric characteristics. To confront the issue of\ninter-class imbalance, we progressively augment the target point clouds with a\nclass-balanced set of pseudo-labeled target instances and source objects, which\nboosts recognition accuracies on both frequently appearing and rare classes.\nExperimental results on three benchmark datasets using both voxel-based (i.e.,\nSECOND) and point-based 3D detectors (i.e., PointRCNN) demonstrate that our\nproposed ReDB approach outperforms existing 3D domain adaptation methods by a\nlarge margin, improving 23.15% mAP on the nuScenes $\\rightarrow$ KITTI task.\nThe code is available at https://github.com/zhuoxiao-chen/ReDB-DA-3Ddet.",

Here,\nwe report the design and implementation of an autonomous workflow for sputter\ndeposition of thin films with controlled composition, leveraging a highly\nautomated sputtering reactor custom-controlled by Python, optical emission\nspectroscopy (OES), and a Bayesian optimization algorithm.

We\nvalidated our approach by autonomously fabricating Zn$_x$Ti$_{1-x}$N$_y$ films\nwith deviations from the targeted cation composition within relative 3.5 %,\neven for 15 nm thin films, demonstrating that the proposed approach can\nreliably synthesize thin films with specific composition and minimal human\ninterference.

This paper focuses on\npromotions with response-dependent costs, where expenses are incurred only when\na purchase is made. Such promotions include discounts and coupons. While\nexisting uplift model approaches aim to address this challenge, these\napproaches often necessitate training multiple models, like meta-learners, or\nencounter complications when estimating profit due to zero-inflated values\nstemming from non-converted individuals with zero cost and profit.\n\nTo address these challenges, we introduce Incremental Profit per Conversion\n(IPC), a novel uplift measure of promotional campaigns' efficiency in unit\neconomics. Through a proposed response transformation, we demonstrate that IPC\nrequires only converted data, its propensity, and a single model to be\nestimated. As a result, IPC resolves the issues mentioned above while\nmitigating the noise typically associated with the class imbalance in\nconversion datasets and biases arising from the many-to-one mapping between\nsearch and purchase data. Lastly, we validate the efficacy of our approach by\npresenting results obtained from a synthetic simulation of a discount coupon\ncampaign.",

          "description": "Random Search is one of the most widely-used method for Hyperparameter\nOptimization, and is critical to the success of deep learning models. Despite\nits astonishing performance, little non-heuristic theory has been developed to\ndescribe the underlying working mechanism. This paper gives a theoretical\naccounting of Random Search. We introduce the concept of \\emph{scattering\ndimension} that describes the landscape of the underlying function, and\nquantifies the performance of random search. We show that, when the environment\nis noise-free, the output of random search converges to the optimal value in\nprobability at rate $ \\widetilde{\\mathcal{O}} \\left( \\left( \\frac{1}{T}\n\\right)^{ \\frac{1}{d_s} } \\right) $, where $ d_s \\ge 0 $ is the scattering\ndimension of the underlying function.

In addition, based on the\nprinciples of random search, we introduce an algorithm, called BLiN-MOS, for\nLipschitz bandits in doubling metric spaces that are also endowed with a\nprobability measure, and show that BLiN-MOS achieves a regret rate of order $\n\\widetilde{\\mathcal{O}} \\left( T^{ \\frac{d_z}{d_z + 1} } \\right) $, where $d_z$\nis the zooming dimension of the problem instance.",

          "description": "Large pre-trained transformers are show-stealer in modern-day deep learning,\nand it becomes crucial to comprehend the parsimonious patterns that exist\nwithin them as they grow in scale. With exploding parameter counts, Lottery\nTicket Hypothesis (LTH) and its variants, have lost their pragmatism in\nsparsifying them due to high computation and memory bottleneck of repetitive\ntrain-prune-retrain routine of iterative magnitude pruning (IMP) which worsens\nwith increasing model size. This paper comprehensively studies induced sparse\npatterns across multiple large pre-trained vision and language transformers. We\npropose the existence of -- essential sparsity defined with a sharp dropping\npoint beyond which the performance declines much faster w.r.t the rise of\nsparsity level, when we directly remove weights with the smallest magnitudes in\none-shot without re-training. We also find essential sparsity to hold valid for\nN:M sparsity patterns as well as on modern-scale large language models\n(Vicuna-7B). We also present an intriguing emerging phenomenon of abrupt\nsparsification during the pre-training of BERT, i.e., BERT suddenly becomes\nheavily sparse in pre-training after certain iterations. Moreover, our\nobservations also indicate a counter-intuitive finding that BERT trained with a\nlarger amount of pre-training data tends to have a better ability to condense\nknowledge in comparatively relatively fewer parameters. Lastly, we investigate\nthe effect of the pre-training loss on essential sparsity and discover that\nself-supervised learning (SSL) objectives trigger stronger emergent\nsparsification properties than supervised learning (SL).

          "description": "This paper uses symmetry to make Convolutional Neural Network classifiers\n(CNNs) robust against adversarial perturbation attacks. Such attacks add\nperturbation to original images to generate adversarial images that fool\nclassifiers such as road sign classifiers of autonomous vehicles. Although\nsymmetry is a pervasive aspect of the natural world, CNNs are unable to handle\nsymmetry well. For example, a CNN can classify an image differently from its\nmirror image. For an adversarial image that misclassifies with a wrong label\n$l_w$, CNN inability to handle symmetry means that a symmetric adversarial\nimage can classify differently from the wrong label $l_w$. Further than that,\nwe find that the classification of a symmetric adversarial image reverts to the\ncorrect label. To classify an image when adversaries are unaware of the\ndefense, we apply symmetry to the image and use the classification label of the\nsymmetric image. To classify an image when adversaries are aware of the\ndefense, we use mirror symmetry and pixel inversion symmetry to form a symmetry\ngroup. We apply all the group symmetries to the image and decide on the output\nlabel based on the agreement of any two of the classification labels of the\nsymmetry images. Adaptive attacks fail because they need to rely on loss\nfunctions that use conflicting CNN output values for symmetric images. Without\nattack knowledge, the proposed symmetry defense succeeds against both\ngradient-based and random-search attacks, with up to near-default accuracies\nfor ImageNet. The defense even improves the classification accuracy of original\nimages.",

          "description": "The state-of-the-art predictive maintenance (PdM) techniques have shown great\nsuccess in reducing maintenance costs and downtime of complicated machines\nwhile increasing overall productivity through extensive utilization of\nInternet-of-Things (IoT) and Deep Learning (DL). Unfortunately, IoT sensors and\nDL algorithms are both prone to cyber-attacks. For instance, DL algorithms are\nknown for their susceptibility to adversarial examples. Such adversarial\nattacks are vastly under-explored in the PdM domain. This is because the\nadversarial attacks in the computer vision domain for classification tasks\ncannot be directly applied to the PdM domain for multivariate time series (MTS)\nregression tasks. In this work, we propose an end-to-end methodology to design\nadversarially robust PdM systems by extensively analyzing the effect of\ndifferent types of adversarial attacks and proposing a novel adversarial\ndefense technique for DL-enabled PdM models. First, we propose novel MTS\nProjected Gradient Descent (PGD) and MTS PGD with random restarts (PGD_r)\nattacks. Then, we evaluate the impact of MTS PGD and PGD_r along with MTS Fast\nGradient Sign Method (FGSM) and MTS Basic Iterative Method (BIM) on Long\nShort-Term Memory (LSTM), Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU), Convolutional Neural\nNetwork (CNN), and Bi-directional LSTM based PdM system. Our results using\nNASA's turbofan engine dataset show that adversarial attacks can cause a severe\ndefect (up to 11X) in the RUL prediction, outperforming the effectiveness of\nthe state-of-the-art PdM attacks by 3X. Furthermore, we present a novel\napproximate adversarial training method to defend against adversarial attacks.\nWe observe that approximate adversarial training can significantly improve the\nrobustness of PdM models (up to 54X) and outperforms the state-of-the-art PdM\ndefense methods by offering 3X more robustness.",

          "description": "Here, we show that the InfoNCE objective is equivalent to the ELBO in a new\nclass of probabilistic generative model, the recognition parameterised model\n(RPM). When we learn the optimal prior, the RPM ELBO becomes equal to the\nmutual information (MI; up to a constant), establishing a connection to\npre-existing self-supervised learning methods such as InfoNCE. However,\npractical InfoNCE methods do not use the MI as an objective; the MI is\ninvariant to arbitrary invertible transformations, so using an MI objective can\nlead to highly entangled representations (Tschannen et al., 2019). Instead, the\nactual InfoNCE objective is a simplified lower bound on the MI which is loose\neven in the infinite sample limit. Thus, an objective that works (i.e. the\nactual InfoNCE objective) appears to be motivated as a loose bound on an\nobjective that does not work (i.e. the true MI which gives arbitrarily\nentangled representations). We give an alternative motivation for the actual\nInfoNCE objective. In particular, we show that in the infinite sample limit,\nand for a particular choice of prior, the actual InfoNCE objective is equal to\nthe ELBO (up to a constant); and the ELBO is equal to the marginal likelihood\nwith a deterministic recognition model. Thus, we argue that our VAE perspective\ngives a better motivation for InfoNCE than MI, as the actual InfoNCE objective\nis only loosely bounded by the MI, but is equal to the ELBO/marginal likelihood\n(up to a constant).",

The use of deep learning for image segmentation has become a\nprevalent trend. The widely adopted approach currently is U-Net and its\nvariants. Additionally, with the remarkable success of pre-trained models in\nnatural language processing tasks, transformer-based models like TransUNet have\nachieved desirable performance on multiple medical image segmentation datasets.\nIn this paper, we conduct a survey of the most representative four medical\nimage segmentation models in recent years. We theoretically analyze the\ncharacteristics of these models and quantitatively evaluate their performance\non two benchmark datasets (i.e., Tuberculosis Chest X-rays and ovarian tumors).\nFinally, we discuss the main challenges and future trends in medical image\nsegmentation.

          "description": "Quality-Diversity (QD) methods are algorithms that aim to generate a set of\ndiverse and high-performing solutions to a given problem. Originally developed\nfor evolutionary robotics, most QD studies are conducted on a limited set of\ndomains - mainly applied to locomotion, where the fitness and the behavior\nsignal are dense. Grasping is a crucial task for manipulation in robotics.\nDespite the efforts of many research communities, this task is yet to be\nsolved. Grasping cumulates unprecedented challenges in QD literature: it\nsuffers from reward sparsity, behavioral sparsity, and behavior space\nmisalignment. The present work studies how QD can address grasping. Experiments\nhave been conducted on 15 different methods on 10 grasping domains,\ncorresponding to 2 different robot-gripper setups and 5 standard objects. An\nevaluation framework that distinguishes the evaluation of an algorithm from its\ninternal components has also been proposed for a fair comparison. The obtained\nresults show that MAP-Elites variants that select successful solutions in\npriority outperform all the compared methods on the studied metrics by a large\nmargin. We also found experimental evidence that sparse interaction can lead to\ndeceptive novelty. To our knowledge, the ability to efficiently produce\nexamples of grasping trajectories demonstrated in this work has no precedent in\nthe literature.",

Our proposed\nframework, ZeroGrads, automates this process by learning a neural approximation\nof the objective function, the surrogate, which in turn can be used to\ndifferentiate through arbitrary black-box graphics pipelines. We train the\nsurrogate on an actively smoothed version of the objective and encourage\nlocality, focusing the surrogate's capacity on what matters at the current\ntraining episode. The fitting is performed online, alongside the parameter\noptimization, and self-supervised, without pre-computed data or pre-trained\nmodels.

We\ndemonstrate optimizing diverse non-convex, non-differentiable black-box\nproblems in graphics, such as visibility in rendering, discrete parameter\nspaces in procedural modelling or optimal control in physics-driven animation.\nIn contrast to more traditional algorithms, our approach scales well to higher\ndimensions, which we demonstrate on problems with up to 35k interlinked\nvariables.",

          "description": "Neural networks (NN) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in various\ntasks, but their computation-intensive nature demands faster and more\nenergy-efficient hardware implementations. Optics-based platforms, using\ntechnologies such as silicon photonics and spatial light modulators, offer\npromising avenues for achieving this goal. However, training multiple trainable\nlayers in tandem with these physical systems poses challenges, as they are\ndifficult to fully characterize and describe with differentiable functions,\nhindering the use of error backpropagation algorithm. The recently introduced\nForward-Forward Algorithm (FFA) eliminates the need for perfect\ncharacterization of the learning system and shows promise for efficient\ntraining with large numbers of programmable parameters. The FFA does not\nrequire backpropagating an error signal to update the weights, rather the\nweights are updated by only sending information in one direction. The local\nloss function for each set of trainable weights enables low-power analog\nhardware implementations without resorting to metaheuristic algorithms or\nreinforcement learning. In this paper, we present an experiment utilizing\nmultimode nonlinear wave propagation in an optical fiber demonstrating the\nfeasibility of the FFA approach using an optical system. The results show that\nincorporating optical transforms in multilayer NN architectures trained with\nthe FFA, can lead to performance improvements, even with a relatively small\nnumber of trainable weights. The proposed method offers a new path to the\nchallenge of training optical NNs and provides insights into leveraging\nphysical transformations for enhancing NN performance.",

In this work, we extend NMFk by adding\nsupport for dense and sparse matrix operation on multi-node, multi-GPU systems.\nThe resulting algorithm is optimized for out-of-memory (OOM) problems where the\nmemory required to factorize a given matrix is greater than the available GPU\nmemory. Memory complexity is reduced by batching/tiling strategies, and sparse\nand dense matrix operations are significantly accelerated with GPU cores (or\ntensor cores when available). Input/Output (I/O) latency associated with batch\ncopies between host and device is hidden using CUDA streams to overlap data\ntransfers and compute asynchronously, and latency associated with collective\ncommunications (both intra-node and inter-node) is reduced using optimized\nNVIDIA Collective Communication Library NCCL based communicators.

          "description": "Node classification is the task of predicting the labels of unlabeled nodes\nin a graph. State-of-the-art methods based on graph neural networks achieve\nexcellent performance when all labels are available during training. But in\nreal-life, models are often applied on data with new classes, which can lead to\nmassive misclassification and thus significantly degrade performance. Hence,\ndeveloping open-set classification methods is crucial to determine if a given\nsample belongs to a known class. Existing methods for open-set node\nclassification generally use transductive learning with part or all of the\nfeatures of real unseen class nodes to help with open-set classification. In\nthis paper, we propose a novel generative open-set node classification method,\ni.e. $\\mathcal{G}^2Pxy$, which follows a stricter inductive learning setting\nwhere no information about unknown classes is available during training and\nvalidation. Two kinds of proxy unknown nodes, inter-class unknown proxies and\nexternal unknown proxies are generated via mixup to efficiently anticipate the\ndistribution of novel classes. Using the generated proxies, a closed-set\nclassifier can be transformed into an open-set one, by augmenting it with an\nextra proxy classifier. Under the constraints of both cross entropy loss and\ncomplement entropy loss, $\\mathcal{G}^2Pxy$ achieves superior effectiveness for\nunknown class detection and known class classification, which is validated by\nexperiments on benchmark graph datasets.

          "description": "Automated medical report generation has become increasingly important in\nmedical analysis. It can produce computer-aided diagnosis descriptions and thus\nsignificantly alleviate the doctors' work. Inspired by the huge success of\nneural machine translation and image captioning, various deep learning methods\nhave been proposed for medical report generation. However, due to the inherent\nproperties of medical data, including data imbalance and the length and\ncorrelation between report sequences, the generated reports by existing methods\nmay exhibit linguistic fluency but lack adequate clinical accuracy. In this\nwork, we propose an image-to-indicator hierarchical transformer (IIHT)\nframework for medical report generation. It consists of three modules, i.e., a\nclassifier module, an indicator expansion module and a generator module. The\nclassifier module first extracts image features from the input medical images\nand produces disease-related indicators with their corresponding states. The\ndisease-related indicators are subsequently utilised as input for the indicator\nexpansion module, incorporating the \"data-text-data\" strategy. The\ntransformer-based generator then leverages these extracted features along with\nimage features as auxiliary information to generate final reports. Furthermore,\nthe proposed IIHT method is feasible for radiologists to modify disease\nindicators in real-world scenarios and integrate the operations into the\nindicator expansion module for fluent and accurate medical report generation.\nExtensive experiments and comparisons with state-of-the-art methods under\nvarious evaluation metrics demonstrate the great performance of the proposed\nmethod.",

          "description": "Ensuring alignment, which refers to making models behave in accordance with\nhuman intentions [1,2], has become a critical task before deploying large\nlanguage models (LLMs) in real-world applications. For instance, OpenAI devoted\nsix months to iteratively aligning GPT-4 before its release [3]. However, a\nmajor challenge faced by practitioners is the lack of clear guidance on\nevaluating whether LLM outputs align with social norms, values, and\nregulations. This obstacle hinders systematic iteration and deployment of LLMs.\nTo address this issue, this paper presents a comprehensive survey of key\ndimensions that are crucial to consider when assessing LLM trustworthiness. The\nsurvey covers seven major categories of LLM trustworthiness: reliability,\nsafety, fairness, resistance to misuse, explainability and reasoning, adherence\nto social norms, and robustness. Each major category is further divided into\nseveral sub-categories, resulting in a total of 29 sub-categories.\nAdditionally, a subset of 8 sub-categories is selected for further\ninvestigation, where corresponding measurement studies are designed and\nconducted on several widely-used LLMs. The measurement results indicate that,\nin general, more aligned models tend to perform better in terms of overall\ntrustworthiness. However, the effectiveness of alignment varies across the\ndifferent trustworthiness categories considered. This highlights the importance\nof conducting more fine-grained analyses, testing, and making continuous\nimprovements on LLM alignment. By shedding light on these key dimensions of LLM\ntrustworthiness, this paper aims to provide valuable insights and guidance to\npractitioners in the field. Understanding and addressing these concerns will be\ncrucial in achieving reliable and ethically sound deployment of LLMs in various\napplications.",

          "description": "The ability to cope accurately and fast with Out-Of-Distribution (OOD)\nsamples is crucial in real-world safety demanding applications. In this work we\nfirst study the interplay between critical points of 3D point clouds and OOD\nsamples. Our findings are that common corruptions and outliers are often\ninterpreted as critical points. We generalize the notion of critical points\ninto importance measures. We show that training a classification network based\nonly on less important points dramatically improves robustness, at a cost of\nminor performance loss on the clean set. We observe that normalized entropy is\nhighly informative for corruption analysis. An adaptive threshold based on\nnormalized entropy is suggested for selecting the set of uncritical points. Our\nproposed importance measure is extremely fast to compute. We show it can be\nused for a variety of applications, such as Explainable AI (XAI), Outlier\nRemoval, Uncertainty Estimation, Robust Classification and Adversarial Defense.\nWe reach SOTA results on the two latter tasks.",

          "description": "Deep learning classifiers achieve state-of-the-art performance in various\nrisk detection applications. They explore rich semantic representations and are\nsupposed to automatically discover risk behaviors. However, due to the lack of\ntransparency, the behavioral semantics cannot be conveyed to downstream\nsecurity experts to reduce their heavy workload in security analysis. Although\nfeature attribution (FA) methods can be used to explain deep learning, the\nunderlying classifier is still blind to what behavior is suspicious, and the\ngenerated explanation cannot adapt to downstream tasks, incurring poor\nexplanation fidelity and intelligibility. In this paper, we propose FINER, the\nfirst framework for risk detection classifiers to generate high-fidelity and\nhigh-intelligibility explanations. The high-level idea is to gather explanation\nefforts from model developer, FA designer, and security experts. To improve\nfidelity, we fine-tune the classifier with an explanation-guided multi-task\nlearning strategy. To improve intelligibility, we engage task knowledge to\nadjust and ensemble FA methods. Extensive evaluations show that FINER improves\nexplanation quality for risk detection. Moreover, we demonstrate that FINER\noutperforms a state-of-the-art tool in facilitating malware analysis.",

          "description": "Environmental perception is a key element of autonomous driving because the\ninformation received from the perception module influences core driving\ndecisions. An outstanding challenge in real-time perception for autonomous\ndriving lies in finding the best trade-off between detection quality and\nlatency. Major constraints on both computation and power have to be taken into\naccount for real-time perception in autonomous vehicles. Larger object\ndetection models tend to produce the best results, but are also slower at\nruntime. Since the most accurate detectors cannot run in real-time locally, we\ninvestigate the possibility of offloading computation to edge and cloud\nplatforms, which are less resource-constrained. We create a synthetic dataset\nto train object detection models and evaluate different offloading strategies.\nUsing real hardware and network simulations, we compare different trade-offs\nbetween prediction quality and end-to-end delay. Since sending raw frames over\nthe network implies additional transmission delays, we also explore the use of\nJPEG and H.265 compression at varying qualities and measure their impact on\nprediction metrics.

          "description": "Optics is an exciting route for the next generation of computing hardware for\nmachine learning, promising several orders of magnitude enhancement in both\ncomputational speed and energy efficiency. However, to reach the full capacity\nof an optical neural network it is necessary that the computing not only for\nthe inference, but also for the training be implemented optically. The primary\nalgorithm for training a neural network is backpropagation, in which the\ncalculation is performed in the order opposite to the information flow for\ninference. While straightforward in a digital computer, optical implementation\nof backpropagation has so far remained elusive, particularly because of the\nconflicting requirements for the optical element that implements the nonlinear\nactivation function. In this work, we address this challenge for the first time\nwith a surprisingly simple and generic scheme. Saturable absorbers are employed\nfor the role of the activation units, and the required properties are achieved\nthrough a pump-probe process, in which the forward propagating signal acts as\nthe pump and backward as the probe. Our approach is adaptable to various analog\nplatforms, materials, and network structures, and it demonstrates the\npossibility of constructing neural networks entirely reliant on analog optical\nprocesses for both training and inference tasks.",

          "description": "Graph clustering is a fundamental task in graph analysis, and recent advances\nin utilizing graph neural networks (GNNs) have shown impressive results.\nDespite the success of existing GNN-based graph clustering methods, they often\noverlook the quality of graph structure, which is inherent in real-world graphs\ndue to their sparse and multifarious nature, leading to subpar performance.\nGraph structure learning allows refining the input graph by adding missing\nlinks and removing spurious connections. However, previous endeavors in graph\nstructure learning have predominantly centered around supervised settings, and\ncannot be directly applied to our specific clustering tasks due to the absence\nof ground-truth labels. To bridge the gap, we propose a novel method called\n\\textbf{ho}mophily-enhanced structure \\textbf{le}arning for graph clustering\n(HoLe). Our motivation stems from the observation that subtly enhancing the\ndegree of homophily within the graph structure can significantly improve GNNs\nand clustering outcomes. To realize this objective, we develop two\nclustering-oriented structure learning modules, i.e., hierarchical correlation\nestimation and cluster-aware sparsification. The former module enables a more\naccurate estimation of pairwise node relationships by leveraging guidance from\nlatent and clustering spaces, while the latter one generates a sparsified\nstructure based on the similarity matrix and clustering assignments.\nAdditionally, we devise a joint optimization approach alternating between\ntraining the homophily-enhanced structure learning and GNN-based clustering,\nthereby enforcing their reciprocal effects. Extensive experiments on seven\nbenchmark datasets of various types and scales, across a range of clustering\nmetrics, demonstrate the superiority of HoLe against state-of-the-art\nbaselines.",

          "description": "Recently, methods for skeleton-based human activity recognition have been\nshown to be vulnerable to adversarial attacks. However, these attack methods\nrequire either the full knowledge of the victim (i.e. white-box attacks),\naccess to training data (i.e. transfer-based attacks) or frequent model queries\n(i.e. black-box attacks). All their requirements are highly restrictive,\nraising the question of how detrimental the vulnerability is. In this paper, we\nshow that the vulnerability indeed exists. To this end, we consider a new\nattack task: the attacker has no access to the victim model or the training\ndata or labels, where we coin the term hard no-box attack. Specifically, we\nfirst learn a motion manifold where we define an adversarial loss to compute a\nnew gradient for the attack, named skeleton-motion-informed (SMI) gradient. Our\ngradient contains information of the motion dynamics, which is different from\nexisting gradient-based attack methods that compute the loss gradient assuming\neach dimension in the data is independent. The SMI gradient can augment many\ngradient-based attack methods, leading to a new family of no-box attack\nmethods. Extensive evaluation and comparison show that our method imposes a\nreal threat to existing classifiers. They also show that the SMI gradient\nimproves the transferability and imperceptibility of adversarial samples in\nboth no-box and transfer-based black-box settings.",

          "description": "Automated driving has the potential to revolutionize personal, public, and\nfreight mobility. Besides the enormous challenge of perception, i.e. accurately\nperceiving the environment using available sensor data, automated driving\ncomprises planning a safe, comfortable, and efficient motion trajectory. To\npromote safety and progress, many works rely on modules that predict the future\nmotion of surrounding traffic. Modular automated driving systems commonly\nhandle prediction and planning as sequential separate tasks. While this\naccounts for the influence of surrounding traffic on the ego-vehicle, it fails\nto anticipate the reactions of traffic participants to the ego-vehicle's\nbehavior. Recent works suggest that integrating prediction and planning in an\ninterdependent joint step is necessary to achieve safe, efficient, and\ncomfortable driving. While various models implement such integrated systems, a\ncomprehensive overview and theoretical understanding of different principles\nare lacking. We systematically review state-of-the-art deep learning-based\nprediction, planning, and integrated prediction and planning models. Different\nfacets of the integration ranging from model architecture and model design to\nbehavioral aspects are considered and related to each other.

Thanks\nto our large-scale dataset, the performance of an existing agent can be pushed\nup (+11% absolute with regard to previous SoTA) to a significantly new best of\n80% single-run success rate on the R2R test split by simple imitation learning.\nThe long-lasting generalization gap between navigating in seen and unseen\nenvironments is also reduced to less than 1% (versus 8% in the previous best\nmethod).

Furthermore, we show that the commonly used single-step\nretrosynthesis benchmark dataset USPTO-50k is insufficient as this evaluation\ntask does not represent model performance and scalability on larger and more\ndiverse datasets. For multi-step synthesis planning, we show that the choice of\nthe single-step model can improve the overall success rate of synthesis\nplanning by up to +28% compared to the commonly used baseline model. Finally,\nwe show that each single-step model finds unique synthesis routes, and differs\nin aspects such as route-finding success, the number of found synthesis routes,\nand chemical validity, making the combination of single-step retrosynthesis\nprediction and multi-step synthesis planning a crucial aspect when developing\nfuture methods.",

This paper fills this gap by (i) creating a\nnovel dataset to enable research on cross-lingual retrieval of already debunked\nnarratives, using tweets as queries to a database of fact-checking articles;\n(ii) presenting an extensive experiment to benchmark fine-tuned and\noff-the-shelf multilingual pre-trained Transformer models for this task; and\n(iii) proposing a novel multistage framework that divides this cross-lingual\ndebunk retrieval task into refinement and re-ranking stages. Results show that\nthe task of cross-lingual retrieval of already debunked narratives is\nchallenging and off-the-shelf Transformer models fail to outperform a strong\nlexical-based baseline (BM25). Nevertheless, our multistage retrieval framework\nis robust, outperforming BM25 in most scenarios and enabling cross-domain and\nzero-shot learning, without significantly harming the model's performance.",

In our proposed SegMatch, the unlabelled\nimages are weakly augmented and fed into the segmentation model to generate a\npseudo-label to enforce the unsupervised loss against the output of the model\nfor the adversarial augmented image on the pixels with a high confidence score.\nOur adaptation for segmentation tasks includes carefully considering the\nequivariance and invariance properties of the augmentation functions we rely\non. To increase the relevance of our augmentations, we depart from using only\nhandcrafted augmentations and introduce a trainable adversarial augmentation\nstrategy. Our algorithm was evaluated on the MICCAI Instrument Segmentation\nChallenge datasets Robust-MIS 2019 and EndoVis 2017.

          "description": "Large skew-t factor copula models are attractive for the modeling of\nfinancial data because they allow for asymmetric and extreme tail dependence.\nWe show that the copula implicit in the skew-t distribution of Azzalini and\nCapitanio (2003) allows for a higher level of pairwise asymmetric dependence\nthan two popular alternative skew-t copulas. Estimation of this copula in high\ndimensions is challenging, and we propose a fast and accurate Bayesian\nvariational inference (VI) approach to do so. The method uses a conditionally\nGaussian generative representation of the skew-t distribution to define an\naugmented posterior that can be approximated accurately. A fast stochastic\ngradient ascent algorithm is used to solve the variational optimization. The\nnew methodology is used to estimate copula models for intraday returns from\n2017 to 2021 on 93 U.S. equities. The copula captures substantial heterogeneity\nin asymmetric dependence over equity pairs, in addition to the variability in\npairwise correlations. We show that intraday predictive densities from the\nskew-t copula are more accurate than from some other copula models, while\nportfolio selection strategies based on the estimated pairwise tail\ndependencies improve performance relative to the benchmark index.",

To overcome these\nchallenges and improve performance across these crucial metrics, one promising\navenue is to incorporate additional structural information about the problem\ninto the RL learning process.

In CGFL, we first extract meta-patterns\nto capture heterogeneous information and propose a multi-view heterogeneous\ngraph neural network (MHGN) to learn meta-patterns across HGs. Then, we propose\na score module to measure the informativeness of labeled samples and determine\nthe transferability of each source HG.

To the best of our knowledge, there is no existing\nwork that simultaneously achieves a linear convergence speed and a small\nlearning error.

          "description": "Hypernetworks, or hypernets in short, are neural networks that generate\nweights for another neural network, known as the target network. They have\nemerged as a powerful deep learning technique that allows for greater\nflexibility, adaptability, dynamism, faster training, information sharing, and\nmodel compression etc. Hypernets have shown promising results in a variety of\ndeep learning problems, including continual learning, causal inference,\ntransfer learning, weight pruning, uncertainty quantification, zero-shot\nlearning, natural language processing, and reinforcement learning etc. Despite\ntheir success across different problem settings, currently, there is no review\navailable to inform the researchers about the developments and to help in\nutilizing hypernets. To fill this gap, we review the progress in hypernets. We\npresent an illustrative example to train deep neural networks using hypernets\nand propose categorizing hypernets based on five design criteria as inputs,\noutputs, variability of inputs and outputs, and architecture of hypernets. We\nalso review applications of hypernets across different deep learning problem\nsettings, followed by a discussion of general scenarios where hypernets can be\neffectively employed. Finally, we discuss the challenges and future directions\nthat remain under-explored in the field of hypernets. We believe that\nhypernetworks have the potential to revolutionize the field of deep learning.\nThey offer a new way to design and train neural networks, and they have the\npotential to improve the performance of deep learning models on a variety of\ntasks. Through this review, we aim to inspire further advancements in deep\nlearning through hypernetworks.",

We learn this space using a\nsubdivision-based encoder-decoder architecture trained in advance on a large\ncollection of surfaces.

We train a graph\nneural network (GNN) to approximate the solution of the user equilibrium (UE)\ntraffic assignment problem and use inferences made by the trained model to\ncalculate fitness function evaluations of a genetic algorithm (GA) to\napproximate solutions for NDPs. Using three test networks, two NDP variants and\nan exact solver as benchmark, we show that on average, our proposed framework\ncan provide solutions within 1.5% gap of the best results in less than 0.5% of\nthe time used by the exact solution procedure. Our framework can be utilized\nwithin an expert system for infrastructure planning to determine the best\ninfrastructure planning and management decisions under different scenarios.\nGiven the flexibility of the framework, it can easily be adapted to many other\ndecision problems that can be modeled as bi-level problems on graphs.

The key observation from our research\nthat can shape future research is that the fitness function evaluation time\nusing the inferences made by the GNN model was in the order of milliseconds,\nwhich points to an opportunity and a need for novel heuristics that 1) can cope\nwell with noisy fitness function values provided by deep learning models, and\n2) can use the significantly enlarged efficiency of the evaluation step to\nexplore the search space effectively (rather than efficiently).

          "description": "Deep neural network (DNN) deployment has been confined to larger hardware\ndevices due to their expensive computational requirements. This challenge has\nrecently reached another scale with the emergence of large language models\n(LLMs). In order to reduce both their memory footprint and latency, a promising\ntechnique is quantization. It consists in converting floating point\nrepresentations to low bit-width fixed point representations, usually by\nassuming a uniform mapping onto a regular grid. This process, referred to in\nthe literature as uniform quantization, may however be ill-suited as most DNN\nweights and activations follow a bell-shaped distribution. This is even worse\non LLMs whose weight distributions are known to exhibit large, high impact,\noutlier values. In this work, we propose an improvement over the most commonly\nadopted way to tackle this limitation in deep learning models quantization,\nnamely, non-uniform quantization. NUPES leverages automorphisms to preserve the\nscalar multiplications. Such transformations are derived from power functions.\nHowever, the optimization of the exponent parameter and weight values remains a\nchallenging and novel problem which could not be solved with previous post\ntraining optimization techniques which only learn to round up or down weight\nvalues in order to preserve the predictive function. We circumvent this\nlimitation with a new paradigm: learning new quantized weights over the entire\nquantized space. Similarly, we enable the optimization of the power exponent,\ni.e. the optimization of the quantization operator itself during training by\nalleviating all the numerical instabilities. The resulting predictive function\nis compatible with integer-only low-bit inference. We show the ability of the\nmethod to achieve state-of-the-art compression rates in both, data-free and\ndata-driven configurations.",

          "description": "Ocean modeling is a powerful tool for simulating the physical, chemical, and\nbiological processes of the ocean, which is the foundation for marine science\nresearch and operational oceanography. Modern numerical ocean modeling mainly\nconsists of governing equations and numerical algorithms. Nonlinear\ninstability, computational expense, low reusability efficiency and high\ncoupling costs have gradually become the main bottlenecks for the further\ndevelopment of numerical ocean modeling. Recently, artificial\nintelligence-based modeling in scientific computing has shown revolutionary\npotential for digital twins and scientific simulations, but the bottlenecks of\nnumerical ocean modeling have not been further solved. Here, we present\nAI-GOMS, a large AI-driven global ocean modeling system, for accurate and\nefficient global ocean daily prediction. AI-GOMS consists of a backbone model\nwith the Fourier-based Masked Autoencoder structure for basic ocean variable\nprediction and lightweight fine-tuning models incorporating regional\ndownscaling, wave decoding, and biochemistry coupling modules. AI-GOMS has\nachieved the best performance in 30 days of prediction for the global ocean\nbasic variables with 15 depth layers at 1/4{\\deg} spatial resolution. Beyond\nthe good performance in statistical metrics, AI-GOMS realizes the simulation of\nmesoscale eddies in the Kuroshio region at 1/12{\\deg} spatial resolution and\nocean stratification in the tropical Pacific Ocean. AI-GOMS provides a new\nbackbone-downstream paradigm for Earth system modeling, which makes the system\ntransferable, scalable and reusable.",

          "description": "In this paper, we describe a new algorithm called Preferential Attachment\nk-class Classifier (PreAttacK) for detecting fake accounts in a social network.\nRecently, several algorithms have obtained high accuracy on this problem.\nHowever, they have done so by relying on information about fake accounts'\nfriendships or the content they share with others--the very things we seek to\nprevent.\n\nPreAttacK represents a significant departure from these approaches. We\nprovide some of the first detailed distributional analyses of how new fake (and\nreal) accounts first attempt to request friends after joining a major network\n(Facebook). We show that even before a new account has made friends or shared\ncontent, these initial friend request behaviors evoke a natural multi-class\nextension of the canonical Preferential Attachment model of social network\ngrowth.\n\nWe use this model to derive a new algorithm, PreAttacK. We prove that in\nrelevant problem instances, PreAttacK near-optimally approximates the posterior\nprobability that a new account is fake under this multi-class Preferential\nAttachment model of new accounts' (not-yet-answered) friend requests. These are\nthe first provable guarantees for fake account detection that apply to new\nusers, and that do not require strong homophily assumptions.\n\nThis principled approach also makes PreAttacK the only algorithm with\nprovable guarantees that obtains state-of-the-art performance on new users on\nthe global Facebook network, where it converges to AUC=0.9 after new users send\n+ receive a total of just 20 not-yet-answered friend requests. For comparison,\nstate-of-the-art benchmarks do not obtain this AUC even after observing\nadditional data on new users' first 100 friend requests. Thus, unlike\nmainstream algorithms, PreAttacK converges before the median new fake account\nhas made a single friendship (accepted friend request) with a human.",

          "description": "Tracking and following objects of interest is critical to several robotics\nuse cases, ranging from industrial automation to logistics and warehousing, to\nhealthcare and security. In this paper, we present a robotic system to detect,\ntrack, and follow any object in real-time. Our approach, dubbed ``follow\nanything'' (FAn), is an open-vocabulary and multimodal model -- it is not\nrestricted to concepts seen at training time and can be applied to novel\nclasses at inference time using text, images, or click queries. Leveraging rich\nvisual descriptors from large-scale pre-trained models (foundation models), FAn\ncan detect and segment objects by matching multimodal queries (text, images,\nclicks) against an input image sequence. These detected and segmented objects\nare tracked across image frames, all while accounting for occlusion and object\nre-emergence. We demonstrate FAn on a real-world robotic system (a micro aerial\nvehicle) and report its ability to seamlessly follow the objects of interest in\na real-time control loop. FAn can be deployed on a laptop with a lightweight\n(6-8 GB) graphics card, achieving a throughput of 6-20 frames per second.

For\nboth algorithms, we provide upper bounds on the average dynamic suboptimality\ngap, which show that as long as the nonstationarity is not significantly large,\nPORTAL and Ada-PORTAL are sample-efficient and can achieve arbitrarily small\naverage dynamic suboptimality gap with polynomial sample complexity.",

          "description": "Code summarization aims to generate concise natural language descriptions for\nsource code. The prevailing approaches adopt transformer-based encoder-decoder\narchitectures, where the Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) of the source code is\nutilized for encoding structural information. However, ASTs are much longer\nthan the corresponding source code, and existing methods ignore this size\nconstraint by directly feeding the entire linearized AST into the encoders.\nThis simplistic approach makes it challenging to extract truly valuable\ndependency relations from the overlong input sequence and leads to significant\ncomputational overhead due to self-attention applied to all nodes in the AST.\n\nTo address this issue effectively and efficiently, we present a model,\nAST-MHSA that uses multi-head attention to extract the important semantic\ninformation from the AST. The model consists of two main components: an encoder\nand a decoder. The encoder takes as input the abstract syntax tree (AST) of the\ncode and generates a sequence of hidden states. The decoder then takes these\nhidden states as input and generates a natural language summary of the code.\n\nThe multi-head attention mechanism allows the model to learn different\nrepresentations of the input code, which can be combined to generate a more\ncomprehensive summary. The model is trained on a dataset of code and summaries,\nand the parameters of the model are optimized to minimize the loss between the\ngenerated summaries and the ground-truth summaries.",

          "description": "Time-dependent partial differential equations (PDEs) are ubiquitous in\nscience and engineering. Recently, mostly due to the high computational cost of\ntraditional solution techniques, deep neural network based surrogates have\ngained increased interest. The practical utility of such neural PDE solvers\nrelies on their ability to provide accurate, stable predictions over long time\nhorizons, which is a notoriously hard problem. In this work, we present a\nlarge-scale analysis of common temporal rollout strategies, identifying the\nneglect of non-dominant spatial frequency information, often associated with\nhigh frequencies in PDE solutions, as the primary pitfall limiting stable,\naccurate rollout performance. Based on these insights, we draw inspiration from\nrecent advances in diffusion models to introduce PDE-Refiner; a novel model\nclass that enables more accurate modeling of all frequency components via a\nmultistep refinement process. We validate PDE-Refiner on challenging benchmarks\nof complex fluid dynamics, demonstrating stable and accurate rollouts that\nconsistently outperform state-of-the-art models, including neural, numerical,\nand hybrid neural-numerical architectures. We further demonstrate that\nPDE-Refiner greatly enhances data efficiency, since the denoising objective\nimplicitly induces a novel form of spectral data augmentation. Finally,\nPDE-Refiner's connection to diffusion models enables an accurate and efficient\nassessment of the model's predictive uncertainty, allowing us to estimate when\nthe surrogate becomes inaccurate.",

          "description": "When applied to autonomous vehicle (AV) settings, action recognition can\nenhance an environment model's situational awareness. This is especially\nprevalent in scenarios where traditional geometric descriptions and heuristics\nin AVs are insufficient. However, action recognition has traditionally been\nstudied for humans, and its limited adaptability to noisy, un-clipped,\nun-pampered, raw RGB data has limited its application in other fields. To push\nfor the advancement and adoption of action recognition into AVs, this work\nproposes a novel two-stage action recognition system, termed RALACs. RALACs\nformulates the problem of action recognition for road scenes, and bridges the\ngap between it and the established field of human action recognition. This work\nshows how attention layers can be useful for encoding the relations across\nagents, and stresses how such a scheme can be class-agnostic. Furthermore, to\naddress the dynamic nature of agents on the road, RALACs constructs a novel\napproach to adapting Region of Interest (ROI) Alignment to agent tracks for\ndownstream action classification. Finally, our scheme also considers the\nproblem of active agent detection, and utilizes a novel application of fusing\noptical flow maps to discern relevant agents in a road scene. We show that our\nproposed scheme can outperform the baseline on the ICCV2021 Road Challenge\ndataset and by deploying it on a real vehicle platform, we provide preliminary\ninsight to the usefulness of action recognition in decision making.",

          "description": "Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are models that are utilized extensively\nfor the hierarchical extraction of features. Vision transformers (ViTs),\nthrough the use of a self-attention mechanism, have recently achieved superior\nmodeling of global contextual information compared to CNNs. However, to realize\ntheir image classification strength, ViTs require substantial training\ndatasets. Where the available training data are limited, current advanced\nmulti-layer perceptrons (MLPs) can provide viable alternatives to both deep\nCNNs and ViTs. In this paper, we developed the SGU-MLP, a learning algorithm\nthat effectively uses both MLPs and spatial gating units (SGUs) for precise\nland use land cover (LULC) mapping. Results illustrated the superiority of the\ndeveloped SGU-MLP classification algorithm over several CNN and CNN-ViT-based\nmodels, including HybridSN, ResNet, iFormer, EfficientFormer and CoAtNet. The\nproposed SGU-MLP algorithm was tested through three experiments in Houston,\nUSA, Berlin, Germany and Augsburg, Germany. The SGU-MLP classification model\nwas found to consistently outperform the benchmark CNN and CNN-ViT-based\nalgorithms. For example, for the Houston experiment, SGU-MLP significantly\noutperformed HybridSN, CoAtNet, Efficientformer, iFormer and ResNet by\napproximately 15%, 19%, 20%, 21%, and 25%, respectively, in terms of average\naccuracy.

Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) with gating\nmechanisms such as LSTM and GRU have been widely successful in learning from\nsequential data due to their ability to capture long-term dependencies.\nConventionally, the update based on current inputs and the previous state\nhistory is each multiplied with dynamic weights and combined to compute the\nnext state.

          "description": "Stroke is a significant cause of mortality and morbidity, necessitating early\npredictive strategies to minimize risks. Traditional methods for evaluating\npatients, such as Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE II,\nIV) and Simplified Acute Physiology Score III (SAPS III), have limited accuracy\nand interpretability. This paper proposes a novel approach: an interpretable,\nattention-based transformer model for early stroke mortality prediction. This\nmodel seeks to address the limitations of previous predictive models, providing\nboth interpretability (providing clear, understandable explanations of the\nmodel) and fidelity (giving a truthful explanation of the model's dynamics from\ninput to output). Furthermore, the study explores and compares fidelity and\ninterpretability scores using Shapley values and attention-based scores to\nimprove model explainability. The research objectives include designing an\ninterpretable attention-based transformer model, evaluating its performance\ncompared to existing models, and providing feature importance derived from the\nmodel.",

          "description": "We examine whether symmetry can be used to defend tree-based ensemble\nclassifiers such as gradient-boosting decision trees (GBDTs) against\nadversarial perturbation attacks. The idea is based on a recent symmetry\ndefense for convolutional neural network classifiers (CNNs) that utilizes CNNs'\nlack of invariance with respect to symmetries. CNNs lack invariance because\nthey can classify a symmetric sample, such as a horizontally flipped image,\ndifferently from the original sample. CNNs' lack of invariance also means that\nCNNs can classify symmetric adversarial samples differently from the incorrect\nclassification of adversarial samples. Using CNNs' lack of invariance, the\nrecent CNN symmetry defense has shown that the classification of symmetric\nadversarial samples reverts to the correct sample classification. In order to\napply the same symmetry defense to GBDTs, we examine GBDT invariance and are\nthe first to show that GBDTs also lack invariance with respect to symmetries.\nWe apply and evaluate the GBDT symmetry defense for nine datasets against six\nperturbation attacks with a threat model that ranges from zero-knowledge to\nperfect-knowledge adversaries. Using the feature inversion symmetry against\nzero-knowledge adversaries, we achieve up to 100% accuracy on adversarial\nsamples even when default and robust classifiers have 0% accuracy. Using the\nfeature inversion and horizontal flip symmetries against perfect-knowledge\nadversaries, we achieve up to over 95% accuracy on adversarial samples for the\nGBDT classifier of the F-MNIST dataset even when default and robust classifiers\nhave 0% accuracy.",

          "description": "We address the challenge of sound propagation simulations in $3$D virtual\nrooms with moving sources, which have applications in virtual/augmented\nreality, game audio, and spatial computing. Solutions to the wave equation can\ndescribe wave phenomena such as diffraction and interference. However,\nsimulating them using conventional numerical discretization methods with\nhundreds of source and receiver positions is intractable, making stimulating a\nsound field with moving sources impractical. To overcome this limitation, we\npropose using deep operator networks to approximate linear wave-equation\noperators. This enables the rapid prediction of sound propagation in realistic\n3D acoustic scenes with moving sources, achieving millisecond-scale\ncomputations. By learning a compact surrogate model, we avoid the offline\ncalculation and storage of impulse responses for all relevant source/listener\npairs. Our experiments, including various complex scene geometries, show good\nagreement with reference solutions, with root mean squared errors ranging from\n0.02 Pa to 0.10 Pa.

These challenges significantly hinder investigations and tasks\nthat involve finding similar sequences. The solution lies in transforming\nsequences into an alternative representation that facilitates easier clustering\ninto similar groups compared to the raw sequences themselves. By assigning a\nunique vector embedding to each short sequence, it is possible to more\nefficiently cluster and improve upon compression performance for the string\nrepresentations of cDNA libraries. Furthermore, through learning alternative\ncoordinate vector embeddings based on the contexts of codon triplets, we can\ndemonstrate clustering based on amino acid properties. Finally, using this\nsequence embedding method to encode barcodes and cDNA sequences, we can improve\nthe time complexity of the similarity search by coupling vector embeddings with\nan algorithm that determines the proximity of vectors in Euclidean space; this\nallows us to perform sequence similarity searches in a quicker and more modular\nfashion.",

Prior neuroimaging-genetic analyses often apply naive feature\nconcatenation approaches in data-driven work or use the findings from one\nmodality to guide posthoc analysis of another, missing the opportunity to\nanalyze the paired multimodal data in a truly unified approach. In this paper,\nwe develop a more integrative model for combining genetic, demographic, and\nneuroimaging data. Inspired by the influence of genotype on phenotype, we\npropose using an attention-based approach where the genetic data guides\nattention to neuroimaging features of importance for model prediction.

          "description": "While many studies have assessed the fairness of AI algorithms in the medical\nfield, the causes of differences in prediction performance are often unknown.\nThis lack of knowledge about the causes of bias hampers the efficacy of bias\nmitigation, as evidenced by the fact that simple dataset balancing still often\nperforms best in reducing performance gaps but is unable to resolve all\nperformance differences. In this work, we investigate the causes of gender bias\nin machine learning-based chest X-ray diagnosis.

Methodologically, we propose a new sampling method\nwhich addresses the highly skewed distribution of recordings per patient in two\nwidely used public datasets, while at the same time reducing the impact of\nlabel errors. Our comprehensive analysis of gender differences across diseases,\ndatasets, and gender representations in the training set shows that dataset\nimbalance is not the sole cause of performance differences. Moreover, relative\ngroup performance differs strongly between datasets, indicating important\ndataset-specific factors influencing male/female group performance. Finally, we\ninvestigate the effect of breast tissue more specifically, by cropping out the\nbreasts from recordings, finding that this does not resolve the observed\nperformance gaps.

While they are promising\nin operational contexts, the trustworthiness of such algorithms is not\nadequately assessed. Failures of ML-integrated systems are poorly understood;\nthe lack of comprehensive risk modeling can degrade the trustworthiness of\nthese systems. In recent reports by the National Institute for Standards and\nTechnology, trustworthiness in ML is a critical barrier to adoption and will\nplay a vital role in intelligent systems' safe and accountable operation. Thus,\nin this work, we demonstrate a real-time model-agnostic method to evaluate the\nrelative reliability of ML predictions by incorporating out-of-distribution\ndetection on the training dataset. It is well documented that ML algorithms\nexcel at interpolation (or near-interpolation) tasks but significantly degrade\nat extrapolation. This occurs when new samples are \"far\" from training samples.\nThe method, referred to as the Laplacian distributed decay for reliability\n(LADDR), determines the difference between the operational and training\ndatasets, which is used to calculate a prediction's relative reliability. LADDR\nis demonstrated on a feedforward neural network-based model used to predict\nsafety significant factors during different loss-of-flow transients. LADDR is\nintended as a \"data supervisor\" and determines the appropriateness of\nwell-trained ML models in the context of operational conditions. Ultimately,\nLADDR illustrates how training data can be used as evidence to support the\ntrustworthiness of ML predictions when utilized for conventional interpolation\ntasks.",

          "description": "Clustering analysis of sequence data continues to address many applications\nin engineering design, aided with the rapid growth of machine learning in\napplied science. This paper presents an unsupervised machine learning algorithm\nto extract defining characteristics of earthquake ground-motion spectra, also\ncalled latent features, to aid in ground-motion selection (GMS). In this\ncontext, a latent feature is a low-dimensional machine-discovered spectral\ncharacteristic learned through nonlinear relationships of a neural network\nautoencoder. Machine discovered latent features can be combined with\ntraditionally defined intensity measures and clustering can be performed to\nselect a representative subgroup from a large ground-motion suite. The\nobjective of efficient GMS is to choose characteristic records representative\nof what the structure will probabilistically experience in its lifetime. Three\nexamples are presented to validate this approach, including the use of\nsynthetic and field recorded ground-motion datasets. The presented deep\nembedding clustering of ground-motion spectra has three main advantages: 1.\ndefining characteristics the represent the sparse spectral content of\nground-motions are discovered efficiently through training of the autoencoder,\n2. domain knowledge is incorporated into the machine learning framework with\nconditional variables in the deep embedding scheme, and 3. method exhibits\nexcellent performance when compared to a benchmark seismic hazard analysis.",

These models must also be computationally cheap enough to ensure\nreal-time tractability. Data-driven surrogate models for mechanistic models can\nbe used to reduce the computational burden of (e)NMPC; however, such models are\ntypically trained by system identification for maximum average prediction\naccuracy on simulation samples and perform suboptimally as part of actual\n(e)NMPC. We present a method for end-to-end reinforcement learning of dynamic\nsurrogate models for optimal performance in (e)NMPC applications, resulting in\npredictive controllers that strike a favorable balance between control\nperformance and computational demand. We validate our method on two\napplications derived from an established nonlinear continuous stirred-tank\nreactor model. We compare the controller performance to that of MPCs utilizing\nmodels trained by the prevailing maximum prediction accuracy paradigm, and\nmodel-free neural network controllers trained using reinforcement learning. We\nshow that our method matches the performance of the model-free neural network\ncontrollers while consistently outperforming models derived from system\nidentification. Additionally, we show that the MPC policies can react to\nchanges in the control setting without retraining.",

          "description": "Continual learning is a promising machine learning paradigm to learn new\ntasks while retaining previously learned knowledge over streaming training\ndata. Till now, rehearsal-based methods, keeping a small part of data from old\ntasks as a memory buffer, have shown good performance in mitigating\ncatastrophic forgetting for previously learned knowledge. However, most of\nthese methods typically treat each new task equally, which may not adequately\nconsider the relationship or similarity between old and new tasks. Furthermore,\nthese methods commonly neglect sample importance in the continual training\nprocess and result in sub-optimal performance on certain tasks. To address this\nchallenging problem, we propose Relational Experience Replay (RER), a bi-level\nlearning framework, to adaptively tune task-wise relationships and sample\nimportance within each task to achieve a better `stability' and `plasticity'\ntrade-off. As such, the proposed method is capable of accumulating new\nknowledge while consolidating previously learned old knowledge during continual\nlearning. Extensive experiments conducted on three publicly available datasets\n(i.e., CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and Tiny ImageNet) show that the proposed method\ncan consistently improve the performance of all baselines and surpass current\nstate-of-the-art methods.",

          "description": "The development of technologies for causal inference with the privacy\npreservation of distributed data has attracted considerable attention in recent\nyears. To address this issue, we propose a data collaboration quasi-experiment\n(DC-QE) that enables causal inference from distributed data with privacy\npreservation. In our method, first, local parties construct\ndimensionality-reduced intermediate representations from the private data.\nSecond, they share intermediate representations, instead of private data for\nprivacy preservation. Third, propensity scores were estimated from the shared\nintermediate representations. Finally, the treatment effects were estimated\nfrom propensity scores. Our method can reduce both random errors and biases,\nwhereas existing methods can only reduce random errors in the estimation of\ntreatment effects. Through numerical experiments on both artificial and\nreal-world data, we confirmed that our method can lead to better estimation\nresults than individual analyses. Dimensionality-reduction loses some of the\ninformation in the private data and causes performance degradation. However, we\nobserved that in the experiments, sharing intermediate representations with\nmany parties to resolve the lack of subjects and covariates, our method\nimproved performance enough to overcome the degradation caused by\ndimensionality-reduction.

Classical\nfew-shot benchmarks make use of few-shot samples from a single modality, but\nsuch samples may not be sufficient to characterize an entire concept class. In\ncontrast, humans use cross-modal information to learn new concepts efficiently.\nIn this work, we demonstrate that one can indeed build a better ${\\bf visual}$\ndog classifier by ${\\bf read}$ing about dogs and ${\\bf listen}$ing to them\nbark. To do so, we exploit the fact that recent multimodal foundation models\nsuch as CLIP are inherently cross-modal, mapping different modalities to the\nsame representation space. Specifically, we propose a simple cross-modal\nadaptation approach that learns from few-shot examples spanning different\nmodalities. By repurposing class names as additional one-shot training samples,\nwe achieve SOTA results with an embarrassingly simple linear classifier for\nvision-language adaptation. Furthermore, we show that our approach can benefit\nexisting methods such as prefix tuning, adapters, and classifier ensembling.\nFinally, to explore other modalities beyond vision and language, we construct\nthe first (to our knowledge) audiovisual few-shot benchmark and use cross-modal\ntraining to improve the performance of both image and audio classification.",

          "description": "Efficient exploration in complex environments remains a major challenge for\nreinforcement learning (RL). Compared to previous Thompson sampling-inspired\nmechanisms that enable temporally extended exploration, i.e., deep exploration,\nwe focus on deep exploration in distributional RL. We develop here a general\npurpose approach, Bag of Policies (BoP), that can be built on top of any return\ndistribution estimator by maintaining a population of its copies. BoP consists\nof an ensemble of multiple heads that are updated independently. During\ntraining, each episode is controlled by only one of the heads and the collected\nstate-action pairs are used to update all heads off-policy, leading to distinct\nlearning signals for each head which diversify learning and behaviour. To test\nwhether optimistic ensemble method can improve on distributional RL as did on\nscalar RL, by e.g. Bootstrapped DQN, we implement the BoP approach with a\npopulation of distributional actor-critics using Bayesian Distributional Policy\nGradients (BDPG). The population thus approximates a posterior distribution of\nreturn distributions along with a posterior distribution of policies. Another\nbenefit of building upon BDPG is that it allows to analyze global posterior\nuncertainty along with local curiosity bonus simultaneously for exploration. As\nBDPG is already an optimistic method, this pairing helps to investigate if\noptimism is accumulatable in distributional RL. Overall BoP results in greater\nrobustness and speed during learning as demonstrated by our experimental\nresults on ALE Atari games.",

          "description": "Unsupervised representation learning approaches aim to learn discriminative\nfeature representations from unlabeled data, without the requirement of\nannotating every sample. Enabling unsupervised representation learning is\nextremely crucial for time series data, due to its unique annotation bottleneck\ncaused by its complex characteristics and lack of visual cues compared with\nother data modalities. In recent years, unsupervised representation learning\ntechniques have advanced rapidly in various domains. However, there is a lack\nof systematic analysis of unsupervised representation learning approaches for\ntime series. To fill the gap, we conduct a comprehensive literature review of\nexisting rapidly evolving unsupervised representation learning approaches for\ntime series. Moreover, we also develop a unified and standardized library,\nnamed ULTS (i.e., Unsupervised Learning for Time Series), to facilitate fast\nimplementations and unified evaluations on various models. With ULTS, we\nempirically evaluate state-of-the-art approaches, especially the rapidly\nevolving contrastive learning methods, on 9 diverse real-world datasets. We\nfurther discuss practical considerations as well as open research challenges on\nunsupervised representation learning for time series to facilitate future\nresearch in this field.",

          "description": "Precise and fast prediction methods for ischemic areas comprised of dead\ntissue, core, and salvageable tissue, penumbra, in acute ischemic stroke (AIS)\npatients are of significant clinical interest. They play an essential role in\nimproving diagnosis and treatment planning. Computed Tomography (CT) scan is\none of the primary modalities for early assessment in patients with suspected\nAIS. CT Perfusion (CTP) is often used as a primary assessment to determine\nstroke location, severity, and volume of ischemic lesions. Current automatic\nsegmentation methods for CTP mostly use already processed 3D parametric maps\nconventionally used for clinical interpretation by radiologists as input.\nAlternatively, the raw CTP data is used on a slice-by-slice basis as 2D+time\ninput, where the spatial information over the volume is ignored. In addition,\nthese methods are only interested in segmenting core regions, while predicting\npenumbra can be essential for treatment planning. This paper investigates\ndifferent methods to utilize the entire 4D CTP as input to fully exploit the\nspatio-temporal information, leading us to propose a novel 4D convolution\nlayer. Our comprehensive experiments on a local dataset of 152 patients divided\ninto three groups show that our proposed models generate more precise results\nthan other methods explored. Adopting the proposed 4D mJ-Net, a Dice\nCoefficient of 0.53 and 0.23 is achieved for segmenting penumbra and core\nareas, respectively.

          "description": "This paper focusses on the optimal implementation of a Mean Variance\nEstimation network (MVE network) (Nix and Weigend, 1994). This type of network\nis often used as a building block for uncertainty estimation methods in a\nregression setting, for instance Concrete dropout (Gal et al., 2017) and Deep\nEnsembles (Lakshminarayanan et al., 2017). Specifically, an MVE network assumes\nthat the data is produced from a normal distribution with a mean function and\nvariance function. The MVE network outputs a mean and variance estimate and\noptimizes the network parameters by minimizing the negative loglikelihood. In\nour paper, we present two significant insights. Firstly, the convergence\ndifficulties reported in recent work can be relatively easily prevented by\nfollowing the simple yet often overlooked recommendation from the original\nauthors that a warm-up period should be used. During this period, only the mean\nis optimized with a fixed variance. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this\nstep through experimentation, highlighting that it should be standard practice.\nAs a sidenote, we examine whether, after the warm-up, it is beneficial to fix\nthe mean while optimizing the variance or to optimize both simultaneously.\nHere, we do not observe a substantial difference. Secondly, we introduce a\nnovel improvement of the MVE network: separate regularization of the mean and\nthe variance estimate. We demonstrate, both on toy examples and on a number of\nbenchmark UCI regression data sets, that following the original recommendations\nand the novel separate regularization can lead to significant improvements.",

We propose a novel learning framework comprising\nof a joint prompt regression and multi-label vocabulary classification\nobjective that generates improved prompts.

We conduct experiments on the DiffusionDB data set, predicting text\nprompts from images generated by Stable Diffusion. Our novel learning framework\nproduces excellent results on the aforementioned task, yielding the highest\ngains when applied on the white-box model.

          "description": "Algorithms for solving the linear classification problem have a long history,\ndating back at least to 1936 with linear discriminant analysis. For linearly\nseparable data, many algorithms can obtain the exact solution to the\ncorresponding 0-1 loss classification problem efficiently, but for data which\nis not linearly separable, it has been shown that this problem, in full\ngenerality, is NP-hard. Alternative approaches all involve approximations of\nsome kind, including the use of surrogates for the 0-1 loss (for example, the\nhinge or logistic loss) or approximate combinatorial search, none of which can\nbe guaranteed to solve the problem exactly. Finding efficient algorithms to\nobtain an exact i.e. globally optimal solution for the 0-1 loss linear\nclassification problem with fixed dimension, remains an open problem. In\nresearch we report here, we detail the rigorous construction of a new\nalgorithm, incremental cell enumeration (ICE), that can solve the 0-1 loss\nclassification problem exactly in polynomial time. We prove correctness using\nconcepts from the theory of hyperplane arrangements and oriented matroids. We\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of this algorithm on synthetic and real-world\ndatasets, showing optimal accuracy both in and out-of-sample, in practical\ncomputational time. We also empirically demonstrate how the use of approximate\nupper bound leads to polynomial time run-time improvements to the algorithm\nwhilst retaining exactness.

Our motivation is to estimate the unknown regression\nfunction from a functional decomposition perspective in which the functional\ncomponents correspond to lower order interaction terms. The idea is to modify\nthe random forest algorithm by keeping certain leaves after they are split\ninstead of deleting them. This leads to non-binary trees which we refer to as\nplanted trees. An extension to a forest leads to our random planted forest\nalgorithm. Additionally, the maximum number of covariates which can interact\nwithin a leaf can be bounded. If we set this interaction bound to one, the\nresulting estimator is a sum of one-dimensional functions. In the other extreme\ncase, if we do not set a limit, the resulting estimator and corresponding model\nplace no restrictions on the form of the regression function. In a simulation\nstudy we find encouraging prediction and visualisation properties of our random\nplanted forest method. We also develop theory for an idealized version of\nrandom planted forests in cases where the interaction bound is low.

          "description": "Multitask learning is a powerful framework that enables one to simultaneously\nlearn multiple related tasks by sharing information between them. Quantifying\nuncertainty in the estimated tasks is of pivotal importance for many downstream\napplications, such as online or active learning. In this work, we provide novel\nmultitask confidence intervals in the challenging agnostic setting, i.e., when\nneither the similarity between tasks nor the tasks' features are available to\nthe learner. The obtained intervals do not require i.i.d. data and can be\ndirectly applied to bound the regret in online learning. Through a refined\nanalysis of the multitask information gain, we obtain new regret guarantees\nthat, depending on a task similarity parameter, can significantly improve over\ntreating tasks independently. We further propose a novel online learning\nalgorithm that achieves such improved regret without knowing this parameter in\nadvance, i.e., automatically adapting to task similarity. As a second key\napplication of our results, we introduce a novel multitask active learning\nsetup where several tasks must be simultaneously optimized, but only one of\nthem can be queried for feedback by the learner at each round. For this\nproblem, we design a no-regret algorithm that uses our confidence intervals to\ndecide which task should be queried. Finally, we empirically validate our\nbounds and algorithms on synthetic and real-world (drug discovery) data.",

          "description": "With the widespread application of personalized online services,\nclick-through rate (CTR) prediction has received more and more attention and\nresearch. The most prominent features of CTR prediction are its multi-field\ncategorical data format, and vast and daily-growing data volume. The large\ncapacity of neural models helps digest such massive amounts of data under the\nsupervised learning paradigm, yet they fail to utilize the substantial data to\nits full potential, since the 1-bit click signal is not sufficient to guide the\nmodel to learn capable representations of features and instances. The\nself-supervised learning paradigm provides a more promising pretrain-finetune\nsolution to better exploit the large amount of user click logs, and learn more\ngeneralized and effective representations. However, self-supervised learning\nfor CTR prediction is still an open question, since current works on this line\nare only preliminary and rudimentary. To this end, we propose a Model-agnostic\npretraining (MAP) framework that applies feature corruption and recovery on\nmulti-field categorical data, and more specifically, we derive two practical\nalgorithms: masked feature prediction (MFP) and replaced feature detection\n(RFD). MFP digs into feature interactions within each instance through masking\nand predicting a small portion of input features, and introduces noise\ncontrastive estimation (NCE) to handle large feature spaces. RFD further turns\nMFP into a binary classification mode through replacing and detecting changes\nin input features, making it even simpler and more effective for CTR\npretraining. Our extensive experiments on two real-world large-scale datasets\n(i.e., Avazu, Criteo) demonstrate the advantages of these two methods on\nseveral strong backbones (e.g., DCNv2, DeepFM), and achieve new\nstate-of-the-art performance in terms of both effectiveness and efficiency for\nCTR prediction.",

          "description": "Diffusion models have emerged as the \\emph{de-facto} technique for image\ngeneration, yet they entail significant computational overhead, hindering the\ntechnique's broader application in the research community. We propose a\nprior-based denoising training framework, the first to incorporate the\npre-train and fine-tune paradigm into the diffusion model training process,\nwhich substantially improves training efficiency and shows potential in\nfacilitating various downstream tasks. Our approach centers on masking a high\nproportion (e.g., up to 90\\%) of the input image and employing masked denoising\nscore matching to denoise the visible areas, thereby guiding the diffusion\nmodel to learn more salient features from training data as prior knowledge. By\nutilizing masked learning in a pre-training stage, we efficiently train the\nViT-based diffusion model on CelebA-HQ $256 \\times 256$ in the pixel space,\nachieving a 4x acceleration and enhancing the quality of generated images\ncompared to denoising diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM). Moreover, our\nmasked pre-training technique can be universally applied to various diffusion\nmodels that directly generate images in the pixel space, aiding in the learning\nof pre-trained models with superior generalizability. For instance, a diffusion\nmodel pre-trained on VGGFace2 attains a 46\\% quality improvement through\nfine-tuning with merely 10\\% data from a different distribution.

          "description": "We consider the inverse acoustic obstacle problem for sound-soft star-shaped\nobstacles in two dimensions wherein the boundary of the obstacle is determined\nfrom measurements of the scattered field at a collection of receivers outside\nthe object. One of the standard approaches for solving this problem is to\nreformulate it as an optimization problem: finding the boundary of the domain\nthat minimizes the $L^2$ distance between computed values of the scattered\nfield and the given measurement data. The optimization problem is\ncomputationally challenging since the local set of convexity shrinks with\nincreasing frequency and results in an increasing number of local minima in the\nvicinity of the true solution. In many practical experimental settings, low\nfrequency measurements are unavailable due to limitations of the experimental\nsetup or the sensors used for measurement. Thus, obtaining a good initial guess\nfor the optimization problem plays a vital role in this environment.\n\nWe present a neural network warm-start approach for solving the inverse\nscattering problem, where an initial guess for the optimization problem is\nobtained using a trained neural network. We demonstrate the effectiveness of\nour method with several numerical examples. For high frequency problems, this\napproach outperforms traditional iterative methods such as Gauss-Newton\ninitialized without any prior (i.e., initialized using a unit circle), or\ninitialized using the solution of a direct method such as the linear sampling\nmethod. The algorithm remains robust to noise in the scattered field\nmeasurements and also converges to the true solution for limited aperture data.\nHowever, the number of training samples required to train the neural network\nscales exponentially in frequency and the complexity of the obstacles\nconsidered. We conclude with a discussion of this phenomenon and potential\ndirections for future research.",

This blending of models results in a two-component model\ncomprising a classical regression model and a neural network part. The CANN\nmodel leverages the strengths of both components, providing a solid foundation\nand interpretability from the classical model while harnessing the flexibility\nand capacity to capture intricate relationships and interactions offered by the\nneural network. In our proposed models, we use well-known log-linear claim\ncount regression models for the classical regression part and a multilayer\nperceptron (MLP) for the neural network part. The MLP part is used to process\ntelematics car driving data given as a vector characterizing the driving\nbehavior of each insured driver. In addition to the Poisson and negative\nbinomial distributions for cross-sectional data, we propose a procedure for\ntraining our CANN model with a multivariate negative binomial (MVNB)\nspecification.

          "description": "Cross-modal representation learning learns a shared embedding between two or\nmore modalities to improve performance in a given task compared to using only\none of the modalities. Cross-modal representation learning from different data\ntypes -- such as images and time-series data (e.g., audio or text data) --\nrequires a deep metric learning loss that minimizes the distance between the\nmodality embeddings. In this paper, we propose to use the contrastive or\ntriplet loss, which uses positive and negative identities to create sample\npairs with different labels, for cross-modal representation learning between\nimage and time-series modalities (CMR-IS). By adapting the triplet loss for\ncross-modal representation learning, higher accuracy in the main (time-series\nclassification) task can be achieved by exploiting additional information of\nthe auxiliary (image classification) task. We present a triplet loss with a\ndynamic margin for single label and sequence-to-sequence classification tasks.\nWe perform extensive evaluations on synthetic image and time-series data, and\non data for offline handwriting recognition (HWR) and on online HWR from\nsensor-enhanced pens for classifying written words. Our experiments show an\nimproved classification accuracy, faster convergence, and better\ngeneralizability due to an improved cross-modal representation. Furthermore,\nthe more suitable generalizability leads to a better adaptability between\nwriters for online HWR.",

          "description": "In recent years, Variational Quantum Algorithms (VQAs) have emerged as a\npromising approach for solving optimization problems on quantum computers in\nthe NISQ era. However, one limitation of VQAs is their reliance on\nfixed-structure circuits, which may not be taylored for specific problems or\nhardware configurations. A leading strategy to address this issue are\nAdaptative VQAs, which dynamically modify the circuit structure by adding and\nremoving gates, and optimize their parameters during the training. Several\nAdaptative VQAs, based on heuristics such as circuit shallowness, entanglement\ncapability and hardware compatibility, have already been proposed in the\nliterature, but there is still lack of a systematic comparison between the\ndifferent methods. In this paper, we aim to fill this gap by analyzing three\nAdaptative VQAs: Evolutionary Variational Quantum Eigensolver (EVQE), Variable\nAnsatz (VAns), already proposed in the literature, and Random Adapt-VQE\n(RA-VQE), a random approach we introduce as a baseline. In order to compare\nthese algorithms to traditional VQAs, we also include the Quantum Approximate\nOptimization Algorithm (QAOA) in our analysis. We apply these algorithms to\nQUBO problems and study their performance by examining the quality of the\nsolutions found and the computational times required. Additionally, we\ninvestigate how the choice of the hyperparameters can impact the overall\nperformance of the algorithms, highlighting the importance of selecting an\nappropriate methodology for hyperparameter tuning. Our analysis sets benchmarks\nfor Adaptative VQAs designed for near-term quantum devices and provides\nvaluable insights to guide future research in this area.",

          "description": "We deal with a general distributed constrained online learning problem with\nprivacy over time-varying networks, where a class of nondecomposable objectives\nare considered. Under this setting, each node only controls a part of the\nglobal decision, and the goal of all nodes is to collaboratively minimize the\nglobal cost over a time horizon $T$ while guarantees the security of the\ntransmitted information. For such problems, we first design a novel generic\nalgorithm framework, named as DPSDA, of differentially private distributed\nonline learning using the Laplace mechanism and the stochastic variants of dual\naveraging method. Note that in the dual updates, all nodes of DPSDA employ the\nnoise-corrupted gradients for more generality. Then, we propose two algorithms,\nnamed as DPSDA-C and DPSDA-PS, under this framework. In DPSDA-C, the nodes\nimplement a circulation-based communication in the primal updates so as to\nalleviate the disagreements over time-varying undirected networks. In addition,\nfor the extension to time-varying directed ones, the nodes implement the\nbroadcast-based push-sum dynamics in DPSDA-PS, which can achieve average\nconsensus over arbitrary directed networks. Theoretical results show that both\nalgorithms attain an expected regret upper bound in $\\mathcal{O}( \\sqrt{T} )$\nwhen the objective function is convex, which matches the best utility\nachievable by cutting-edge algorithms.

          "description": "Albeit being a prevalent architecture searching approach, differentiable\narchitecture search (DARTS) is largely hindered by its substantial memory cost\nsince the entire supernet resides in the memory. This is where the single-path\nDARTS comes in, which only chooses a single-path submodel at each step. While\nbeing memory-friendly, it also comes with low computational costs. Nonetheless,\nwe discover a critical issue of single-path DARTS that has not been primarily\nnoticed. Namely, it also suffers from severe performance collapse since too\nmany parameter-free operations like skip connections are derived, just like\nDARTS does. In this paper, we propose a new algorithm called RObustifying\nMemory-Efficient NAS (ROME) to give a cure. First, we disentangle the topology\nsearch from the operation search to make searching and evaluation consistent.\nWe then adopt Gumbel-Top2 reparameterization and gradient accumulation to\nrobustify the unwieldy bi-level optimization. We verify ROME extensively across\n15 benchmarks to demonstrate its effectiveness and robustness.",

The\nsatisfaction of users and the interests of platforms are closely related to the\nquality of the generated recommendation results. However, as a highly\ndata-driven system, recommender system could be affected by data or algorithmic\nbias and thus generate unfair results, which could weaken the reliance of the\nsystems. As a result, it is crucial to address the potential unfairness\nproblems in recommendation settings. Recently, there has been growing attention\non fairness considerations in recommender systems with more and more literature\non approaches to promote fairness in recommendation. However, the studies are\nrather fragmented and lack a systematic organization, thus making it difficult\nto penetrate for new researchers to the domain. This motivates us to provide a\nsystematic survey of existing works on fairness in recommendation. This survey\nfocuses on the foundations for fairness in recommendation literature.

          "description": "Recently, significant advancements have been made in time-series forecasting\nresearch, with an increasing focus on analyzing the nature of time-series data,\ne.g, channel-independence (CI) and channel-dependence (CD), rather than solely\nfocusing on designing sophisticated forecasting models. However, current\nresearch has primarily focused on either CI or CD in isolation, and the\nchallenge of effectively combining these two opposing properties to achieve a\nsynergistic effect remains an unresolved issue. In this paper, we carefully\nexamine the opposing properties of CI and CD, and raise a practical question\nthat has not been effectively answered, e.g.,\"How to effectively mix the CI and\nCD properties of time series to achieve better predictive performance?\" To\nanswer this question, we propose Mlinear (MIX-Linear), a simple yet effective\nmethod based mainly on linear layers. The design philosophy of Mlinear mainly\nincludes two aspects:(1) dynamically tuning the CI and CD properties based on\nthe time semantics of different input time series, and (2) providing deep\nsupervision to adjust the individual performance of the \"CI predictor\" and \"CD\npredictor\". In addition, empirically, we introduce a new loss function that\nsignificantly outperforms the widely used mean squared error (MSE) on multiple\ndatasets. Experiments on time-series datasets covering multiple fields and\nwidely used have demonstrated the superiority of our method over PatchTST which\nis the lateset Transformer-based method in terms of the MSE and MAE metrics on\n7 datasets with identical sequence inputs (336 or 512). Specifically, our\nmethod significantly outperforms PatchTST with a ratio of 21:3 at 336 sequence\nlength input and 29:10 at 512 sequence length input. Additionally, our approach\nhas a 10 $\\times$ efficiency advantage at the unit level, taking into account\nboth training and inference times.",

We create and use a symbolic version of the SVAMP\ndataset and find that GPT-3's davinci-002 model also has good zero-shot\naccuracy on symbolic MWPs.

We explore a self-prompting\napproach to encourage the symbolic reasoning to align with the numeric answer,\nthus equipping the LLM with the ability to provide a concise and verifiable\nreasoning and making it more interpretable.

          "description": "Adversarial training (AT) is widely considered the state-of-the-art technique\nfor improving the robustness of deep neural networks (DNNs) against adversarial\nexamples (AE). Nevertheless, recent studies have revealed that adversarially\ntrained models are prone to unfairness problems, restricting their\napplicability. In this paper, we empirically observe that this limitation may\nbe attributed to serious adversarial confidence overfitting, i.e., certain\nadversarial examples with overconfidence. To alleviate this problem, we propose\nHAM, a straightforward yet effective framework via adaptive Hard Adversarial\nexample Mining.HAM concentrates on mining hard adversarial examples while\ndiscarding the easy ones in an adaptive fashion. Specifically, HAM identifies\nhard AEs in terms of their step sizes needed to cross the decision boundary\nwhen calculating loss value. Besides, an early-dropping mechanism is\nincorporated to discard the easy examples at the initial stages of AE\ngeneration, resulting in efficient AT. Extensive experimental results on\nCIFAR-10, SVHN, and Imagenette demonstrate that HAM achieves significant\nimprovement in robust fairness while reducing computational cost compared to\nseveral state-of-the-art adversarial training methods.

The trained U-Net models can accurately\npredict von Mises stress and strain fields, with structural similarity index\nscores (SSIM) of 0.854 and 0.830 and mean squared errors of 0.017 and 0.018 for\nstress and strain, respectively, on a reserved test set. Meanwhile, the cGAN\nmodels in a combination of ensemble and transfer learning techniques\ndemonstrate high accuracy in predicting von Mises stress and strain fields, as\nevidenced by SSIM scores of 0.890 for stress and 0.803 for strain.\nAdditionally, mean squared errors of 0.008 for stress and 0.017 for strain\nfurther support the model's performance on a designated test set. Overall, this\nstudy developed a surrogate model for finite element analysis, which can\naccurately and efficiently predict stress-strain fields of arterial walls\nregardless of complex geometries and boundary conditions.",

However,\ngenerating music, as a special type of audio, presents unique challenges due to\nlimited availability of music data and sensitive issues related to copyright\nand plagiarism. In this paper, to tackle these challenges, we first construct a\nstate-of-the-art text-to-music model, MusicLDM, that adapts Stable Diffusion\nand AudioLDM architectures to the music domain. We achieve this by retraining\nthe contrastive language-audio pretraining model (CLAP) and the Hifi-GAN\nvocoder, as components of MusicLDM, on a collection of music data samples.\nThen, to address the limitations of training data and to avoid plagiarism, we\nleverage a beat tracking model and propose two different mixup strategies for\ndata augmentation: beat-synchronous audio mixup and beat-synchronous latent\nmixup, which recombine training audio directly or via a latent embeddings\nspace, respectively. Such mixup strategies encourage the model to interpolate\nbetween musical training samples and generate new music within the convex hull\nof the training data, making the generated music more diverse while still\nstaying faithful to the corresponding style. In addition to popular evaluation\nmetrics, we design several new evaluation metrics based on CLAP score to\ndemonstrate that our proposed MusicLDM and beat-synchronous mixup strategies\nimprove both the quality and novelty of generated music, as well as the\ncorrespondence between input text and generated music.",

          "description": "Depth completion, which aims to generate high-quality dense depth maps from\nsparse depth maps, has attracted increasing attention in recent years. Previous\nwork usually employs RGB images as guidance, and introduces iterative spatial\npropagation to refine estimated coarse depth maps. However, most of the\npropagation refinement methods require several iterations and suffer from a\nfixed receptive field, which may contain irrelevant and useless information\nwith very sparse input. In this paper, we address these two challenges\nsimultaneously by revisiting the idea of deformable convolution.

To\nbetter understand the function of deformable convolution and exploit it for\ndepth completion, we further systematically investigate a variety of\nrepresentative strategies.

          "description": "Graph and hypergraph representation learning has attracted increasing\nattention from various research fields. Despite the decent performance and\nfruitful applications of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), Hypergraph Neural\nNetworks (HGNNs), and their well-designed variants, on some commonly used\nbenchmark graphs and hypergraphs, they are outperformed by even a simple\nMulti-Layer Perceptron. This observation motivates a reexamination of the\ndesign paradigm of the current GNNs and HGNNs and poses challenges of\nextracting graph features effectively. In this work, a universal feature\nencoder for both graph and hypergraph representation learning is designed,\ncalled UniG-Encoder. The architecture starts with a forward transformation of\nthe topological relationships of connected nodes into edge or hyperedge\nfeatures via a normalized projection matrix. The resulting edge/hyperedge\nfeatures, together with the original node features, are fed into a neural\nnetwork. The encoded node embeddings are then derived from the reversed\ntransformation, described by the transpose of the projection matrix, of the\nnetwork's output, which can be further used for tasks such as node\nclassification.

          "description": "Visual Question Answering (VQA) based on multi-modal data facilitates\nreal-life applications such as home robots and medical diagnoses. One\nsignificant challenge is to devise a robust decentralized learning framework\nfor various client models where centralized data collection is refrained due to\nconfidentiality concerns. This work aims to tackle privacy-preserving VQA by\ndecoupling a multi-modal model into representation modules and a contrastive\nmodule and leveraging inter-module gradients sharing and inter-client weight\nsharing. To this end, we propose Bidirectional Contrastive Split Learning\n(BiCSL) to train a global multi-modal model on the entire data distribution of\ndecentralized clients. We employ the contrastive loss that enables a more\nefficient self-supervised learning of decentralized modules. Comprehensive\nexperiments are conducted on the VQA-v2 dataset based on five SOTA VQA models,\ndemonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed method. Furthermore, we inspect\nBiCSL's robustness against a dual-key backdoor attack on VQA. Consequently,\nBiCSL shows much better robustness to the multi-modal adversarial attack\ncompared to the centralized learning method, which provides a promising\napproach to decentralized multi-modal learning.",

We formulate and study shifts beyond\nindependent perturbations, exploring Joint Distribution Shifts, where the\nper-observation perturbations can be coordinated. We analyze several important\nstatistical problems, including location estimation, linear regression, and\nnon-parametric density estimation. Under a squared loss for mean estimation and\nprediction error in linear regression, we find the exact minimax risk, a least\nfavorable perturbation, and show that the sample mean and least squares\nestimators are respectively optimal. This holds for both independent and joint\nshifts, but the least favorable perturbations and minimax risks differ. For\nother problems, we provide nearly optimal estimators and precise finite-sample\nbounds. We also introduce several tools for bounding the minimax risk under\ndistribution shift, such as a smoothing technique for location families, and\ngeneralizations of classical tools including least favorable sequences of\npriors, the modulus of continuity, Le Cam's, Fano's, and Assouad's methods.",

          "description": "Recent studies have shown that deep neural networks (DNNs) are vulnerable to\nadversarial attacks, including evasion and backdoor (poisoning) attacks. On the\ndefense side, there have been intensive efforts on improving both empirical and\nprovable robustness against evasion attacks; however, the provable robustness\nagainst backdoor attacks still remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we\nfocus on certifying the machine learning model robustness against general\nthreat models, especially backdoor attacks. We first provide a unified\nframework via randomized smoothing techniques and show how it can be\ninstantiated to certify the robustness against both evasion and backdoor\nattacks. We then propose the first robust training process, RAB, to smooth the\ntrained model and certify its robustness against backdoor attacks. We prove the\nrobustness bound for machine learning models trained with RAB and prove that\nour robustness bound is tight. In addition, we theoretically show that it is\npossible to train the robust smoothed models efficiently for simple models such\nas K-nearest neighbor classifiers, and we propose an exact smooth-training\nalgorithm that eliminates the need to sample from a noise distribution for such\nmodels. Empirically, we conduct comprehensive experiments for different machine\nlearning (ML) models such as DNNs, support vector machines, and K-NN models on\nMNIST, CIFAR-10, and ImageNette datasets and provide the first benchmark for\ncertified robustness against backdoor attacks. In addition, we evaluate K-NN\nmodels on a spambase tabular dataset to demonstrate the advantages of the\nproposed exact algorithm. Both the theoretic analysis and the comprehensive\nevaluation on diverse ML models and datasets shed light on further robust\nlearning strategies against general training time attacks.",

          "description": "Knowing the actual precipitation in space and time is critical in\nhydrological modelling applications, yet the spatial coverage with rain gauge\nstations is limited due to economic constraints. Gridded satellite\nprecipitation datasets offer an alternative option for estimating the actual\nprecipitation by covering uniformly large areas, albeit related estimates are\nnot accurate. To improve precipitation estimates, machine learning is applied\nto merge rain gauge-based measurements and gridded satellite precipitation\nproducts. In this context, observed precipitation plays the role of the\ndependent variable, while satellite data play the role of predictor variables.\nRandom forests is the dominant machine learning algorithm in relevant\napplications. In those spatial predictions settings, point predictions (mostly\nthe mean or the median of the conditional distribution) of the dependent\nvariable are issued. The aim of the manuscript is to solve the problem of\nprobabilistic prediction of precipitation with an emphasis on extreme quantiles\nin spatial interpolation settings. Here we propose, issuing probabilistic\nspatial predictions of precipitation using Light Gradient Boosting Machine\n(LightGBM). LightGBM is a boosting algorithm, highlighted by prize-winning\nentries in prediction and forecasting competitions. To assess LightGBM, we\ncontribute a large-scale application that includes merging daily precipitation\nmeasurements in contiguous US with PERSIANN and GPM-IMERG satellite\nprecipitation data. We focus on extreme quantiles of the probability\ndistribution of the dependent variable, where LightGBM outperforms quantile\nregression forests (QRF, a variant of random forests) in terms of quantile\nscore at extreme quantiles. Our study offers understanding of probabilistic\npredictions in spatial settings using machine learning.",

          "description": "Latent Graph Inference (LGI) relaxed the reliance of Graph Neural Networks\n(GNNs) on a given graph topology by dynamically learning it. However, most of\nLGI methods assume to have a (noisy, incomplete, improvable, ...) input graph\nto rewire and can solely learn regular graph topologies. In the wake of the\nsuccess of Topological Deep Learning (TDL), we study Latent Topology Inference\n(LTI) for learning higher-order cell complexes (with sparse and not regular\ntopology) describing multi-way interactions between data points. To this aim,\nwe introduce the Differentiable Cell Complex Module (DCM), a novel learnable\nfunction that computes cell probabilities in the complex to improve the\ndownstream task. We show how to integrate DCM with cell complex message passing\nnetworks layers and train it in a end-to-end fashion, thanks to a two-step\ninference procedure that avoids an exhaustive search across all possible cells\nin the input, thus maintaining scalability.

For this reason, surrogate models are developed\nto replace computationally expensive solvers with more efficient ones, which\ncan strike favorable trade-offs between accuracy and efficiency. This work\nexplores the potential usage of graph neural networks (GNNs) for the simulation\nof time-dependent PDEs in the presence of geometrical variability. In\nparticular, we propose a systematic strategy to build surrogate models based on\na data-driven time-stepping scheme where a GNN architecture is used to\nefficiently evolve the system. With respect to the majority of surrogate\nmodels, the proposed approach stands out for its ability of tackling problems\nwith parameter dependent spatial domains, while simultaneously generalizing to\ndifferent geometries and mesh resolutions. We assess the effectiveness of the\nproposed approach through a series of numerical experiments, involving both\ntwo- and three-dimensional problems, showing that GNNs can provide a valid\nalternative to traditional surrogate models in terms of computational\nefficiency and generalization to new scenarios.

However, recent\nstudies disclosed that label distribution matrices are typically full-rank,\nposing challenges to those works exploiting low-rank label correlation. Note\nthat multi-label is generally low-rank; low-rank label correlation is widely\nadopted in multi-label learning (MLL) literature.

In such a way, low-rank label\ncorrelation is appropriately exploited in our LDL methods. We conduct\ncomprehensive experiments and demonstrate that our methods are superior to\nexisting LDL methods.

          "description": "The literature on machine learning in the context of data streams is vast and\ngrowing. However, many of the defining assumptions regarding data-stream\nlearning tasks are too strong to hold in practice, or are even contradictory\nsuch that they cannot be met in the contexts of supervised learning. Algorithms\nare chosen and designed based on criteria which are often not clearly stated,\nfor problem settings not clearly defined, tested in unrealistic settings,\nand/or in isolation from related approaches in the wider literature. This puts\ninto question the potential for real-world impact of many approaches conceived\nin such contexts, and risks propagating a misguided research focus. We propose\nto tackle these issues by reformulating the fundamental definitions and\nsettings of supervised data-stream learning with regard to contemporary\nconsiderations of concept drift and temporal dependence; and we take a fresh\nlook at what constitutes a supervised data-stream learning task, and a\nreconsideration of algorithms that may be applied to tackle such tasks. Through\nand in reflection of this formulation and overview, helped by an informal\nsurvey of industrial players dealing with real-world data streams, we provide\nrecommendations. Our main emphasis is that learning from data streams does not\nimpose a single-pass or online-learning approach, or any particular learning\nregime; and any constraints on memory and time are not specific to streaming.\nMeanwhile, there exist established techniques for dealing with temporal\ndependence and concept drift, in other areas of the literature. For the data\nstreams community, we thus encourage a shift in research focus, from dealing\nwith often-artificial constraints and assumptions on the learning mode, to\nissues such as robustness, privacy, and interpretability which are increasingly\nrelevant to learning in data streams in academic and industrial settings.",

          "description": "Despite the proliferation of diverse hardware accelerators (e.g., NPU, TPU,\nDPU), deploying deep learning models on edge devices with fixed-point hardware\nis still challenging due to complex model quantization and conversion.

Accordingly, deep\nlearning models cannot be easily quantized for diverse fixed-point hardwares,\nmainly due to slightly different quantization requirements. In this paper, we\nenvision a new type of model quantization approach called MRQ (model\nre-quantization), which takes existing quantized models and quickly transforms\nthe models to meet different quantization requirements (e.g., asymmetric ->\nsymmetric, non-power-of-2 scale -> power-of-2 scale). Re-quantization is much\nsimpler than quantizing from scratch because it avoids costly re-training and\nprovides support for multiple quantization schemes simultaneously. To minimize\nre-quantization error, we developed a new set of re-quantization algorithms\nincluding weight correction and rounding error folding. We have demonstrated\nthat MobileNetV2 QAT model [7] can be quickly re-quantized into two different\nquantization schemes (i.e., symmetric and symmetric+power-of-2 scale) with less\nthan 0.64 units of accuracy loss. We believe our work is the first to leverage\nthis concept of re-quantization for model quantization and models obtained from\nthe re-quantization process have been successfully deployed on NNA in the Echo\nShow devices.",

          "description": "Identification of nonlinear dynamical systems has been popularized by sparse\nidentification of the nonlinear dynamics (SINDy) via the sequentially\nthresholded least squares (STLS) algorithm. Many extensions SINDy have emerged\nin the literature to deal with experimental data which are finite in length and\nnoisy. Recently, the computationally intensive method of ensembling\nbootstrapped SINDy models (E-SINDy) was proposed for model identification,\nhandling finite, highly noisy data. While the extensions of SINDy are numerous,\ntheir sparsity-promoting estimators occasionally provide sparse approximations\nof the dynamics as opposed to exact recovery. Furthermore, these estimators\nsuffer under multicollinearity, e.g. the irrepresentable condition for the\nLasso. In this paper, we demonstrate that the Trimmed Lasso for robust\nidentification of models (TRIM) can provide exact recovery under more severe\nnoise, finite data, and multicollinearity as opposed to E-SINDy. Additionally,\nthe computational cost of TRIM is asymptotically equal to STLS since the\nsparsity parameter of the TRIM can be solved efficiently by convex solvers. We\ncompare these methodologies on challenging nonlinear systems, specifically the\nLorenz 63 system, the Bouc Wen oscillator from the nonlinear dynamics benchmark\nof No\\\"el and Schoukens, 2016, and a time delay system describing tool cutting\ndynamics. This study emphasizes the comparisons between STLS, reweighted\n$\\ell_1$ minimization, and Trimmed Lasso in identification with respect to\nproblems faced by practitioners: the problem of finite and noisy data, the\nperformance of the sparse regression of when the library grows in dimension\n(multicollinearity), and automatic methods for choice of regularization\nparameters.",

To\naddress this limitation, recent models such as denoising diffusion implicit\nmodels (DDIM) focus on generating samples without directly modeling the\nprobability distribution, while models like denoising diffusion generative\nadversarial networks (GAN) combine diffusion processes with GANs. In the field\nof speech synthesis, a recent diffusion speech synthesis model called\nDiffGAN-TTS, utilizing the structure of GANs, has been introduced and\ndemonstrates superior performance in both speech quality and generation speed.\nIn this paper, to further enhance the performance of DiffGAN-TTS, we propose a\nspeech synthesis model with two discriminators: a diffusion discriminator for\nlearning the distribution of the reverse process and a spectrogram\ndiscriminator for learning the distribution of the generated data. Objective\nmetrics such as structural similarity index measure (SSIM), mel-cepstral\ndistortion (MCD), F0 root mean squared error (F0 RMSE), short-time objective\nintelligibility (STOI), perceptual evaluation of speech quality (PESQ), as well\nas subjective metrics like mean opinion score (MOS), are used to evaluate the\nperformance of the proposed model.

          "description": "In response to recent data regulation requirements, machine unlearning (MU)\nhas emerged as a critical process to remove the influence of specific examples\nfrom a given model. Although exact unlearning can be achieved through complete\nmodel retraining using the remaining dataset, the associated computational\ncosts have driven the development of efficient, approximate unlearning\ntechniques. Moving beyond data-centric MU approaches, our study introduces a\nnovel model-based perspective: model sparsification via weight pruning, which\nis capable of reducing the gap between exact unlearning and approximate\nunlearning. We show in both theory and practice that model sparsity can boost\nthe multi-criteria unlearning performance of an approximate unlearner, closing\nthe approximation gap, while continuing to be efficient. This leads to a new MU\nparadigm, termed prune first, then unlearn, which infuses a sparse model prior\ninto the unlearning process. Building on this insight, we also develop a\nsparsity-aware unlearning method that utilizes sparsity regularization to\nenhance the training process of approximate unlearning. Extensive experiments\nshow that our proposals consistently benefit MU in various unlearning\nscenarios. A notable highlight is the 77% unlearning efficacy gain of\nfine-tuning (one of the simplest unlearning methods) when using sparsity-aware\nunlearning.

In this work, we propose a novel face-swapping\nframework called Megapixel Facial Identity Manipulation (MFIM). The\nface-swapping model should achieve two goals. First, it should be able to\ngenerate a high-quality image. We argue that a model which is proficient in\ngenerating a megapixel image can achieve this goal. However, generating a\nmegapixel image is generally difficult without careful model design. Therefore,\nour model exploits pretrained StyleGAN in the manner of GAN-inversion to\neffectively generate a megapixel image. Second, it should be able to\neffectively transform the identity of a given image. Specifically, it should be\nable to actively transform ID attributes (e.g., face shape and eyes) of a given\nimage into those of another person, while preserving ID-irrelevant attributes\n(e.g., pose and expression). To achieve this goal, we exploit 3DMM that can\ncapture various facial attributes.

          "description": "In this work we approach attractor neural networks from a machine learning\nperspective: we look for optimal network parameters by applying a gradient\ndescent over a regularized loss function. Within this framework, the optimal\nneuron-interaction matrices turn out to be a class of matrices which correspond\nto Hebbian kernels revised by iteratively applying some unlearning protocols.\nRemarkably, the number of unlearning steps is proved to be related to the\nregularization hyperparameters of the loss function and to the training time.\nThus, we can design strategies to avoid overfitting that are formulated in\nterms of the algebraic properties of the interaction matrix, or, equivalently,\nin terms of regularization tuning and early-stopping strategies. The\ngeneralization capabilities of these attractor networks are also investigated:\nanalytical results are obtained for random synthetic datasets, next, the\nemerging picture is corroborated by numerical experiments that highlight the\nexistence of several regimes (i.e., overfitting, failure and success) as the\ndataset parameters are varied.",

          "description": "Human intelligence excels at combining basic skills to solve complex tasks.\nThis capability is vital for Artificial Intelligence (AI) and should be\nembedded in comprehensive intelligent models, enabling them to harness expert\nmodels for complex task-solving towards Artificial General Intelligence (AGI).\nLarge Language Models (LLMs) show promising learning and reasoning abilities,\nand can effectively use external models, tools or APIs to tackle complex\nproblems.

          "description": "Long exposure photography produces stunning imagery, representing moving\nelements in a scene with motion-blur. It is generally employed in two\nmodalities, producing either a foreground or a background blur effect.\nForeground blur images are traditionally captured on a tripod-mounted camera\nand portray blurred moving foreground elements, such as silky water or light\ntrails, over a perfectly sharp background landscape. Background blur images,\nalso called panning photography, are captured while the camera is tracking a\nmoving subject, to produce an image of a sharp subject over a background\nblurred by relative motion. Both techniques are notoriously challenging and\nrequire additional equipment and advanced skills. In this paper, we describe a\ncomputational burst photography system that operates in a hand-held smartphone\ncamera app, and achieves these effects fully automatically, at the tap of the\nshutter button. Our approach first detects and segments the salient subject. We\ntrack the scene motion over multiple frames and align the images in order to\npreserve desired sharpness and to produce aesthetically pleasing motion\nstreaks. We capture an under-exposed burst and select the subset of input\nframes that will produce blur trails of controlled length, regardless of scene\nor camera motion velocity. We predict inter-frame motion and synthesize\nmotion-blur to fill the temporal gaps between the input frames. Finally, we\ncomposite the blurred image with the sharp regular exposure to protect the\nsharpness of faces or areas of the scene that are barely moving, and produce a\nfinal high resolution and high dynamic range (HDR) photograph. Our system\ndemocratizes a capability previously reserved to professionals, and makes this\ncreative style accessible to most casual photographers.\n\nMore information and supplementary material can be found on our project\nwebpage: https://motion-mode.github.io/",

In this work, we propose a\npost-hoc sampling strategy for estimating predictive uncertainty accounting for\ndata ambiguity. The method can generate different plausible outputs for a given\ninput and does not assume parametric forms of predictive distributions. It is\narchitecture agnostic and can be applied to any feed-forward deterministic\nnetwork without changes to the architecture or training procedure. Experiments\non regression tasks on imaging and non-imaging input data show the method's\nability to generate diverse and multi-modal predictive distributions, and a\ndesirable correlation of the estimated uncertainty with the prediction error.",

          "description": "Recently, bi-level optimization (BLO) has taken center stage in some very\nexciting developments in the area of signal processing (SP) and machine\nlearning (ML). Roughly speaking, BLO is a classical optimization problem that\ninvolves two levels of hierarchy (i.e., upper and lower levels), wherein\nobtaining the solution to the upper-level problem requires solving the\nlower-level one. BLO has become popular largely because it is powerful in\nmodeling problems in SP and ML, among others, that involve optimizing nested\nobjective functions. Prominent applications of BLO range from resource\nallocation for wireless systems to adversarial machine learning. In this work,\nwe focus on a class of tractable BLO problems that often appear in SP and ML\napplications. We provide an overview of some basic concepts of this class of\nBLO problems, such as their optimality conditions, standard algorithms\n(including their optimization principles and practical implementations), as\nwell as how they can be leveraged to obtain state-of-the-art results for a\nnumber of key SP and ML applications. Further, we discuss some recent advances\nin BLO theory, its implications for applications, and point out some\nlimitations of the state-of-the-art that require significant future research\nefforts. Overall, we hope that this article can serve to accelerate the\nadoption of BLO as a generic tool to model, analyze, and innovate on a wide\narray of emerging SP and ML applications.",

          "description": "With the advent of the big data era, the data quality problem is becoming\nmore critical. Among many factors, data with missing values is one primary\nissue, and thus developing effective imputation models is a key topic in the\nresearch community. Recently, a major research direction is to employ neural\nnetwork models such as self-organizing mappings or automatic encoders for\nfilling missing values. However, these classical methods can hardly discover\ninterrelated features and common features simultaneously among data attributes.\nEspecially, it is a very typical problem for classical autoencoders that they\noften learn invalid constant mappings, which dramatically hurts the filling\nperformance. To solve the above-mentioned problems, we propose a\nmissing-value-filling model based on a feature-fusion-enhanced autoencoder. We\nfirst incorporate into an autoencoder a hidden layer that consists of\nde-tracking neurons and radial basis function neurons, which can enhance the\nability of learning interrelated features and common features. Besides, we\ndevelop a missing value filling strategy based on dynamic clustering that is\nincorporated into an iterative optimization process. This design can enhance\nthe multi-dimensional feature fusion ability and thus improves the dynamic\ncollaborative missing-value-filling performance. The effectiveness of the\nproposed model is validated by extensive experiments compared to a variety of\nbaseline methods on thirteen data sets.",

Moreover, the approximations significantly decrease\naccuracy in benchmarks, suggesting that an entirely different approach may be\nmore fruitful. Here, grounded on recent theory for Hebbian learning in soft\nwinner-take-all networks, we present multilayer SoftHebb, i.e. an algorithm\nthat trains deep neural networks, without any feedback, target, or error\nsignals. As a result, it achieves efficiency by avoiding weight transport,\nnon-local plasticity, time-locking of layer updates, iterative equilibria, and\n(self-) supervisory or other feedback signals -- which were necessary in other\napproaches. Its increased efficiency and biological compatibility do not trade\noff accuracy compared to state-of-the-art bio-plausible learning, but rather\nimprove it. With up to five hidden layers and an added linear classifier,\naccuracies on MNIST, CIFAR-10, STL-10, and ImageNet, respectively reach 99.4%,\n80.3%, 76.2%, and 27.3%.

In the special case of a scalar function $f: \\mathbb{R} \\to\n\\mathbb{R}$, our algorithm takes as input a reference point $x_0$, trust region\n$[a, b]$, and integer $k \\ge 1$, and returns an interval $I$ such that $f(x) -\n\\sum_{i=0}^{k-1} \\frac {1} {i!} f^{(i)}(x_0) (x - x_0)^i \\in I (x - x_0)^k$ for\nall $x \\in [a, b]$. As in automatic differentiation, the function $f$ is\nprovided to the algorithm in symbolic form, and must be composed of known\natomic functions.\n\nAt a high level, our algorithm has two steps. First, for a variety of\ncommonly-used elementary functions (e.g., $\\exp$, $\\log$), we use\nrecently-developed theory to derive sharp polynomial upper and lower bounds on\nthe Taylor remainder series. We then recursively combine the bounds for the\nelementary functions using an interval arithmetic variant of Taylor-mode\nautomatic differentiation. Our algorithm can make efficient use of machine\nlearning hardware accelerators, and we provide an open source implementation in\nJAX.\n\nWe then turn our attention to applications. Most notably, in a companion\npaper we use our new machinery to create the first universal\nmajorization-minimization optimization algorithms: algorithms that iteratively\nminimize an arbitrary loss using a majorizer that is derived automatically,\nrather than by hand. We also show that our automatically-derived bounds can be\nused for verified global optimization and numerical integration, and to prove\nsharper versions of Jensen's inequality.",

          "description": "With the advancement of DNNs into safety-critical applications, testing\napproaches for such models have gained more attention. A current direction is\nthe search for and identification of systematic weaknesses that put safety\nassumptions based on average performance values at risk. Such weaknesses can\ntake on the form of (semantically coherent) subsets or areas in the input space\nwhere a DNN performs systematically worse than its expected average. However,\nit is non-trivial to attribute the reason for such observed low performances to\nthe specific semantic features that describe the subset. For instance,\ninhomogeneities within the data w.r.t. other (non-considered) attributes might\ndistort results. However, taking into account all (available) attributes and\ntheir interaction is often computationally highly expensive. Inspired by\ncounterfactual explanations, we propose an effective and computationally cheap\nalgorithm to validate the semantic attribution of existing subsets, i.e., to\ncheck whether the identified attribute is likely to have caused the degraded\nperformance. We demonstrate this approach on an example from the autonomous\ndriving domain using highly annotated simulated data, where we show for a\nsemantic segmentation model that (i) performance differences among the\ndifferent pedestrian assets exist, but (ii) only in some cases is the asset\ntype itself the reason for this reduction in the performance.",

          "description": "Multi-label image recognition in the low-label regime is a task of great\nchallenge and practical significance. Previous works have focused on learning\nthe alignment between textual and visual spaces to compensate for limited image\nlabels, yet may suffer from reduced accuracy due to the scarcity of\nhigh-quality multi-label annotations. In this research, we leverage the\npowerful alignment between textual and visual features pretrained with millions\nof auxiliary image-text pairs. We introduce an efficient and effective\nframework called Evidence-guided Dual Context Optimization (DualCoOp++), which\nserves as a unified approach for addressing partial-label and zero-shot\nmulti-label recognition. In DualCoOp++ we separately encode evidential,\npositive, and negative contexts for target classes as parametric components of\nthe linguistic input (i.e., prompts). The evidential context aims to discover\nall the related visual content for the target class, and serves as guidance to\naggregate positive and negative contexts from the spatial domain of the image,\nenabling better distinguishment between similar categories. Additionally, we\nintroduce a Winner-Take-All module that promotes inter-class interaction during\ntraining, while avoiding the need for extra parameters and costs. As DualCoOp++\nimposes minimal additional learnable overhead on the pretrained vision-language\nframework, it enables rapid adaptation to multi-label recognition tasks with\nlimited annotations and even unseen classes. Experiments on standard\nmulti-label recognition benchmarks across two challenging low-label settings\ndemonstrate the superior performance of our approach compared to\nstate-of-the-art methods.",

          "description": "Extensive research has been conducted on fault diagnosis of planetary\ngearboxes using vibration signals and deep learning (DL) approaches. However,\nDL-based methods are susceptible to the domain shift problem caused by varying\noperating conditions of the gearbox. Although domain adaptation and data\nsynthesis methods have been proposed to overcome such domain shifts, they are\noften not directly applicable in real-world situations where only healthy data\nis available in the target domain. To tackle the challenge of extreme domain\nshift scenarios where only healthy data is available in the target domain, this\npaper proposes two novel domain knowledge-informed data synthesis methods\nutilizing the health data map (HDMap). The two proposed approaches are referred\nto as scaled CutPaste and FaultPaste. The HDMap is used to physically represent\nthe vibration signal of the planetary gearbox as an image-like matrix, allowing\nfor visualization of fault-related features. CutPaste and FaultPaste are then\napplied to generate faulty samples based on the healthy data in the target\ndomain, using domain knowledge and fault signatures extracted from the source\ndomain, respectively. In addition to generating realistic faults, the proposed\nmethods introduce scaling of fault signatures for controlled synthesis of\nfaults with various severity levels. A case study is conducted on a planetary\ngearbox testbed to evaluate the proposed approaches. The results show that the\nproposed methods are capable of accurately diagnosing faults, even in cases of\nextreme domain shift, and can estimate the severity of faults that have not\nbeen previously observed in the target domain.",

          "description": "As neural networks become more popular, the need for accompanying uncertainty\nestimates increases. There are currently two main approaches to test the\nquality of these estimates. Most methods output a density. They can be compared\nby evaluating their loglikelihood on a test set. Other methods output a\nprediction interval directly. These methods are often tested by examining the\nfraction of test points that fall inside the corresponding prediction\nintervals. Intuitively both approaches seem logical. However, we demonstrate\nthrough both theoretical arguments and simulations that both ways of evaluating\nthe quality of uncertainty estimates have serious flaws. Firstly, both\napproaches cannot disentangle the separate components that jointly create the\npredictive uncertainty, making it difficult to evaluate the quality of the\nestimates of these components. Secondly, a better loglikelihood does not\nguarantee better prediction intervals, which is what the methods are often used\nfor in practice. Moreover, the current approach to test prediction intervals\ndirectly has additional flaws. We show why it is fundamentally flawed to test a\nprediction or confidence interval on a single test set. At best, marginal\ncoverage is measured, implicitly averaging out overconfident and underconfident\npredictions. A much more desirable property is pointwise coverage, requiring\nthe correct coverage for each prediction. We demonstrate through practical\nexamples that these effects can result in favoring a method, based on the\npredictive uncertainty, that has undesirable behaviour of the confidence or\nprediction intervals. Finally, we propose a simulation-based testing approach\nthat addresses these problems while still allowing easy comparison between\ndifferent methods.",

This technique is known to improve the\ngeneralization performance in many learning paradigms and applications. In this\nwork, we first analyze Mixup and show that it implicitly regularizes infinitely\nmany directional derivatives of all orders. Based on this new insight, we\npropose an improved version of Mixup, theoretically justified to deliver better\ngeneralization performance than the vanilla Mixup. To demonstrate the\neffectiveness of the proposed method, we conduct experiments across various\ndomains such as images, tabular data, speech, and graphs.

To obtain a well-regularized latent space\nthat is conducive for uncertainty estimation, existing methods bring in\nsignificant changes to model architectures and training procedures. In this\npaper, we present a lightweight, fast, and high-performance regularization\nmethod for Mahalanobis distance-based uncertainty prediction, and that requires\nminimal changes to the network's architecture. To derive Gaussian latent\nrepresentation favourable for Mahalanobis Distance calculation, we introduce a\nself-supervised representation learning method that separates in-class\nrepresentations into multiple Gaussians. Classes with non-Gaussian\nrepresentations are automatically identified and dynamically clustered into\nmultiple new classes that are approximately Gaussian. Evaluation on standard\nOOD benchmarks shows that our method achieves state-of-the-art results on OOD\ndetection with minimal inference time, and is very competitive on predictive\nprobability calibration.

          "description": "We study property prediction for crystal materials. A crystal structure\nconsists of a minimal unit cell that is repeated infinitely in 3D space. How to\naccurately represent such repetitive structures in machine learning models\nremains unresolved. Current methods construct graphs by establishing edges only\nbetween nearby nodes, thereby failing to faithfully capture infinite repeating\npatterns and distant interatomic interactions. In this work, we propose several\ninnovations to overcome these limitations. First, we propose to model\nphysics-principled interatomic potentials directly instead of only using\ndistances as in many existing methods. These potentials include the Coulomb\npotential, London dispersion potential, and Pauli repulsion potential. Second,\nwe model the complete set of potentials among all atoms, instead of only\nbetween nearby atoms as in existing methods. This is enabled by our\napproximations of infinite potential summations with provable error bounds. We\nfurther develop efficient algorithms to compute the approximations. Finally, we\npropose to incorporate our computations of complete interatomic potentials into\nmessage passing neural networks for representation learning. We perform\nexperiments on the JARVIS and Materials Project benchmarks for evaluation.\nResults show that the use of interatomic potentials and complete interatomic\npotentials leads to consistent performance improvements with reasonable\ncomputational costs.

          "description": "Deep learning (DL) approaches are being increasingly used for time-series\nforecasting, with many efforts devoted to designing complex DL models. Recent\nstudies have shown that the DL success is often attributed to effective data\nrepresentations, fostering the fields of feature engineering and representation\nlearning. However, automated approaches for feature learning are typically\nlimited with respect to incorporating prior knowledge, identifying interactions\namong variables, and choosing evaluation metrics to ensure that the models are\nreliable. To improve on these limitations, this paper contributes a novel\nvisual analytics framework, namely TimeTuner, designed to help analysts\nunderstand how model behaviors are associated with localized correlations,\nstationarity, and granularity of time-series representations. The system mainly\nconsists of the following two-stage technique: We first leverage counterfactual\nexplanations to connect the relationships among time-series representations,\nmultivariate features and model predictions. Next, we design multiple\ncoordinated views including a partition-based correlation matrix and juxtaposed\nbivariate stripes, and provide a set of interactions that allow users to step\ninto the transformation selection process, navigate through the feature space,\nand reason the model performance. We instantiate TimeTuner with two\ntransformation methods of smoothing and sampling, and demonstrate its\napplicability on real-world time-series forecasting of univariate sunspots and\nmultivariate air pollutants. Feedback from domain experts indicates that our\nsystem can help characterize time-series representations and guide the feature\nengineering processes.",

          "description": "Learned cardinality estimation methods have achieved high precision compared\nto traditional methods. Among learned methods, query-driven approaches face the\ndata and workload drift problem for a long time. Although both query-driven and\nhybrid methods are proposed to avoid this problem, even the state-of-art of\nthem suffer from high training and estimation costs, limited scalability,\ninstability, and long-tailed distribution problem on high cardinality and high\ndimensional tables, which seriously affects the practical application of\nlearned cardinality estimators. In this paper, we prove that most of these\nproblems are directly caused by the widely used progressive sampling. We solve\nthis problem by introducing predicates into the autoregressive model and\npropose Duet, a stable, efficient, and scalable hybrid method to estimate\ncardinality directly without sampling or any non-differentiable process, which\ncan not only reduces the inference complexity from $O(n)$ to $O(1)$ compared to\nNaru and UAE but also achieve higher accuracy on high cardinality and high\ndimensional tables.

Thereby the experimental setup is designed as an embedded system, which\nis of interest for robotics and energy harvesting applications. Specifically,\nwe study the control of angular velocity of the Acrobot, as well as control of\nits total energy, which is the sum of the kinetic and the potential energy. By\nthis means the RL algorithm is designed to drive the angular velocity or the\nenergy of the first pendulum of the Acrobot towards a desired value. With this,\nlibration or full rotation of the unactuated pendulum of the Acrobot is\nachieved. Moreover, investigations of the Acrobot control are carried out,\nwhich lead to insights about the influence of the state space discretization,\nthe episode length, the action space or the mass of the driven pendulum on the\nRL control.

          "description": "Algorithmic Gaussianization is a phenomenon that can arise when using\nrandomized sketching or sampling methods to produce smaller representations of\nlarge datasets: For certain tasks, these sketched representations have been\nobserved to exhibit many robust performance characteristics that are known to\noccur when a data sample comes from a sub-gaussian random design, which is a\npowerful statistical model of data distributions. However, this phenomenon has\nonly been studied for specific tasks and metrics, or by relying on\ncomputationally expensive methods. We address this by providing an algorithmic\nframework for gaussianizing data distributions via averaging, proving that it\nis possible to efficiently construct data sketches that are nearly\nindistinguishable (in terms of total variation distance) from sub-gaussian\nrandom designs. In particular, relying on a recently introduced sketching\ntechnique called Leverage Score Sparsified (LESS) embeddings, we show that one\ncan construct an $n\\times d$ sketch of an $N\\times d$ matrix $A$, where $n\\ll\nN$, that is nearly indistinguishable from a sub-gaussian design, in time\n$O(\\text{nnz}(A)\\log N + nd^2)$, where $\\text{nnz}(A)$ is the number of\nnon-zero entries in $A$. As a consequence, strong statistical guarantees and\nprecise asymptotics available for the estimators produced from sub-gaussian\ndesigns (e.g., for least squares and Lasso regression, covariance estimation,\nlow-rank approximation, etc.) can be straightforwardly adapted to our sketching\nframework. We illustrate this with a new approximation guarantee for sketched\nleast squares, among other examples.",

          "description": "Self-supervised learning (SSL) strategies have demonstrated remarkable\nperformance in various recognition tasks. However, both our preliminary\ninvestigation and recent studies suggest that they may be less effective in\nlearning representations for fine-grained visual recognition (FGVR) since many\nfeatures helpful for optimizing SSL objectives are not suitable for\ncharacterizing the subtle differences in FGVR. To overcome this issue, we\npropose learning an additional screening mechanism to identify discriminative\nclues commonly seen across instances and classes, dubbed as common rationales\nin this paper. Intuitively, common rationales tend to correspond to the\ndiscriminative patterns from the key parts of foreground objects. We show that\na common rationale detector can be learned by simply exploiting the GradCAM\ninduced from the SSL objective without using any pre-trained object parts or\nsaliency detectors, making it seamlessly to be integrated with the existing SSL\nprocess. Specifically, we fit the GradCAM with a branch with limited fitting\ncapacity, which allows the branch to capture the common rationales and discard\nthe less common discriminative patterns. At the test stage, the branch\ngenerates a set of spatial weights to selectively aggregate features\nrepresenting an instance. Extensive experimental results on four visual tasks\ndemonstrate that the proposed method can lead to a significant improvement in\ndifferent evaluation settings.",

          "description": "Deep-learning models for traffic data prediction can have superior\nperformance in modeling complex functions using a multi-layer architecture.\nHowever, a major drawback of these approaches is that most of these approaches\ndo not offer forecasts with uncertainty estimates, which are essential for\ntraffic operations and control. Without uncertainty estimates, it is difficult\nto place any level of trust to the model predictions, and operational\nstrategies relying on overconfident predictions can lead to worsening traffic\nconditions. In this study, we propose a Bayesian recurrent neural network\nframework for uncertainty quantification in traffic prediction with higher\ngeneralizability by introducing spectral normalization to its hidden layers. In\nour paper, we have shown that normalization alters the training process of deep\nneural networks by controlling the model's complexity and reducing the risk of\noverfitting to the training data. This, in turn, helps improve the\ngeneralization performance of the model on out-of-distribution datasets.\nResults demonstrate that spectral normalization improves uncertainty estimates\nand significantly outperforms both the layer normalization and model without\nnormalization in single-step prediction horizons. This improved performance can\nbe attributed to the ability of spectral normalization to better localize the\nfeature space of the data under perturbations. Our findings are especially\nrelevant to traffic management applications, where predicting traffic\nconditions across multiple locations is the goal, but the availability of\ntraining data from multiple locations is limited. Spectral normalization,\ntherefore, provides a more generalizable approach that can effectively capture\nthe underlying patterns in traffic data without requiring location-specific\nmodels.",

          "description": "Weighted low rank approximation is a fundamental problem in numerical linear\nalgebra, and it has many applications in machine learning. Given a matrix $M\n\\in \\mathbb{R}^{n \\times n}$, a weight matrix $W \\in \\mathbb{R}_{\\geq 0}^{n\n\\times n}$, a parameter $k$, the goal is to output two matrices $U, V \\in\n\\mathbb{R}^{n \\times k}$ such that $\\| W \\circ (M - U V^\\top) \\|_F$ is\nminimized, where $\\circ$ denotes the Hadamard product. Such a problem is known\nto be NP-hard and even hard to approximate assuming Exponential Time Hypothesis\n[GG11, RSW16]. Meanwhile, alternating minimization is a good heuristic solution\nfor approximating weighted low rank approximation. The work [LLR16] shows that,\nunder mild assumptions, alternating minimization does provide provable\nguarantees. In this work, we develop an efficient and robust framework for\nalternating minimization. For weighted low rank approximation, this improves\nthe runtime of [LLR16] from $n^2 k^2$ to $n^2k$. At the heart of our work\nframework is a high-accuracy multiple response regression solver together with\na robust analysis of alternating minimization.",

          "description": "We consider the vulnerability of fairness-constrained learning to small\namounts of malicious noise in the training data. Konstantinov and Lampert\n(2021) initiated the study of this question and presented negative results\nshowing there exist data distributions where for several fairness constraints,\nany proper learner will exhibit high vulnerability when group sizes are\nimbalanced. Here, we present a more optimistic view, showing that if we allow\nrandomized classifiers, then the landscape is much more nuanced. For example,\nfor Demographic Parity we show we can incur only a $\\Theta(\\alpha)$ loss in\naccuracy, where $\\alpha$ is the malicious noise rate, matching the best\npossible even without fairness constraints. For Equal Opportunity, we show we\ncan incur an $O(\\sqrt{\\alpha})$ loss, and give a matching\n$\\Omega(\\sqrt{\\alpha})$lower bound. In contrast, Konstantinov and Lampert\n(2021) showed for proper learners the loss in accuracy for both notions is\n$\\Omega(1)$. The key technical novelty of our work is how randomization can\nbypass simple \"tricks\" an adversary can use to amplify his power. We also\nconsider additional fairness notions including Equalized Odds and Calibration.\nFor these fairness notions, the excess accuracy clusters into three natural\nregimes $O(\\alpha)$,$O(\\sqrt{\\alpha})$ and $O(1)$.

          "description": "In this paper, we propose a computationally efficient framework for interval\nreachability of neural network controlled systems. Our approach builds upon\ninclusion functions for the neural network controller and the open-loop system.\nWe observe that many state-of-the-art neural network verifiers can produce\ninclusion functions for neural networks. We introduce and analyze a new class\nof inclusion functions for the open-loop dynamics based on bounds of the\nfunction Jacobian that is particularly suitable for capturing the interactions\nbetween systems and neural network controllers. Next, for any dynamical system,\nwe use inclusion functions to construct an embedding system with twice the\nnumber of states as the original system. We show that a single trajectory of\nthis embedding system provides hyper-rectangular over-approximations of\nreachable sets. We then propose two approaches for constructing a closed-loop\nembedding system for a neural network controlled dynamical system that accounts\nfor the interaction between the system and the controller in different ways.\nThe interconnection-based approach accounts for the worst-case evolution of\neach coordinate separately by substituting the neural network inclusion\nfunction into the open-loop embedding system. The interaction-based approach\nuses the newly introduced class of Jacobian-based inclusion functions to fully\ncapture first-order interactions between the system and the controller.\nFinally, we implement our approach in a Python framework called\n\\texttt{ReachMM} and show that on several existing benchmarks, our methods\noutperform the existing approaches in the literature.

          "description": "Nonconvex-nonconcave minimax optimization has gained widespread interest over\nthe last decade. However, most existing works focus on variants of gradient\ndescent-ascent (GDA) algorithms, which are only applicable to smooth\nnonconvex-concave settings. To address this limitation, we propose a novel\nalgorithm named smoothed proximal linear descent-ascent (smoothed PLDA), which\ncan effectively handle a broad range of structured nonsmooth\nnonconvex-nonconcave minimax problems. Specifically, we consider the setting\nwhere the primal function has a nonsmooth composite structure and the dual\nfunction possesses the Kurdyka-Lojasiewicz (KL) property with exponent $\\theta\n\\in [0,1)$. We introduce a novel convergence analysis framework for smoothed\nPLDA, the key components of which are our newly developed nonsmooth primal\nerror bound and dual error bound. Using this framework, we show that smoothed\nPLDA can find both $\\epsilon$-game-stationary points and\n$\\epsilon$-optimization-stationary points of the problems of interest in\n$\\mathcal{O}(\\epsilon^{-2\\max\\{2\\theta,1\\}})$ iterations. Furthermore, when\n$\\theta \\in [0,\\frac{1}{2}]$, smoothed PLDA achieves the optimal iteration\ncomplexity of $\\mathcal{O}(\\epsilon^{-2})$. To further demonstrate the\neffectiveness and wide applicability of our analysis framework, we show that\ncertain max-structured problem possesses the KL property with exponent\n$\\theta=0$ under mild assumptions. As a by-product, we establish\nalgorithm-independent quantitative relationships among various stationarity\nconcepts, which may be of independent interest.",

          "description": "Low-count PET is an efficient way to reduce radiation exposure and\nacquisition time, but the reconstructed images often suffer from low\nsignal-to-noise ratio (SNR), thus affecting diagnosis and other downstream\ntasks. Recent advances in deep learning have shown great potential in improving\nlow-count PET image quality, but acquiring a large, centralized, and diverse\ndataset from multiple institutions for training a robust model is difficult due\nto privacy and security concerns of patient data. Moreover, low-count PET data\nat different institutions may have different data distribution, thus requiring\npersonalized models. While previous federated learning (FL) algorithms enable\nmulti-institution collaborative training without the need of aggregating local\ndata, addressing the large domain shift in the application of\nmulti-institutional low-count PET denoising remains a challenge and is still\nhighly under-explored. In this work, we propose FedFTN, a personalized\nfederated learning strategy that addresses these challenges. FedFTN uses a\nlocal deep feature transformation network (FTN) to modulate the feature outputs\nof a globally shared denoising network, enabling personalized low-count PET\ndenoising for each institution. During the federated learning process, only the\ndenoising network's weights are communicated and aggregated, while the FTN\nremains at the local institutions for feature transformation. We evaluated our\nmethod using a large-scale dataset of multi-institutional low-count PET imaging\ndata from three medical centers located across three continents, and showed\nthat FedFTN provides high-quality low-count PET images, outperforming previous\nbaseline FL reconstruction methods across all low-count levels at all three\ninstitutions.",

          "description": "Constraint programming is known for being an efficient approach for solving\ncombinatorial problems. Important design choices in a solver are the branching\nheuristics, which are designed to lead the search to the best solutions in a\nminimum amount of time. However, developing these heuristics is a\ntime-consuming process that requires problem-specific expertise. This\nobservation has motivated many efforts to use machine learning to automatically\nlearn efficient heuristics without expert intervention. To the best of our\nknowledge, it is still an open research question. Although several generic\nvariable-selection heuristics are available in the literature, the options for\na generic value-selection heuristic are more scarce. In this paper, we propose\nto tackle this issue by introducing a generic learning procedure that can be\nused to obtain a value-selection heuristic inside a constraint programming\nsolver. This has been achieved thanks to the combination of a deep Q-learning\nalgorithm, a tailored reward signal, and a heterogeneous graph neural network\narchitecture.

          "description": "Existing causal models for link prediction assume an underlying set of\ninherent node factors -- an innate characteristic defined at the node's birth\n-- that governs the causal evolution of links in the graph. In some causal\ntasks, however, link formation is path-dependent: The outcome of link\ninterventions depends on existing links. Unfortunately, these existing causal\nmethods are not designed for path-dependent link formation, as the cascading\nfunctional dependencies between links (arising from path dependence) are either\nunidentifiable or require an impractical number of control variables. To\novercome this, we develop the first causal model capable of dealing with path\ndependencies in link prediction. In this work we introduce the concept of\ncausal lifting, an invariance in causal models of independent interest that, on\ngraphs, allows the identification of causal link prediction queries using\nlimited interventional data. Further, we show how structural pairwise\nembeddings exhibit lower bias and correctly represent the task's causal\nstructure, as opposed to existing node embeddings, e.g., graph neural network\nnode embeddings and matrix factorization. Finally, we validate our theoretical\nfindings on three scenarios for causal link prediction tasks: knowledge base\ncompletion, covariance matrix estimation and consumer-product recommendations.",

          "description": "This paper explores the application of emerging machine learning methods from\nimage super-resolution (SR) to the task of statistical downscaling. We\nspecifically focus on convolutional neural network-based Generative Adversarial\nNetworks (GANs). Our GANs are conditioned on low-resolution (LR) inputs to\ngenerate high-resolution (HR) surface winds emulating Weather Research and\nForecasting (WRF) model simulations over North America. Unlike traditional SR\nmodels, where LR inputs are idealized coarsened versions of the HR images, WRF\nemulation involves using non-idealized LR and HR pairs resulting in\nshared-scale mismatches due to internal variability. Our study builds upon\ncurrent SR-based statistical downscaling by experimenting with a novel\nfrequency-separation (FS) approach from the computer vision field. To assess\nthe skill of SR models, we carefully select evaluation metrics, and focus on\nperformance measures based on spatial power spectra. Our analyses reveal how\nGAN configurations influence spatial structures in the generated fields,\nparticularly biases in spatial variability spectra. Using power spectra to\nevaluate the FS experiments reveals that successful applications of FS in\ncomputer vision do not translate to climate fields. However, the FS experiments\ndemonstrate the sensitivity of power spectra to a commonly used GAN-based SR\nobjective function, which helps interpret and understand its role in\ndetermining spatial structures. This result motivates the development of a\nnovel partial frequency-separation scheme as a promising configuration option.\nWe also quantify the influence on GAN performance of non-idealized LR fields\nresulting from internal variability. Furthermore, we conduct a spectra-based\nfeature-importance experiment allowing us to explore the dependence of the\nspatial structure of generated fields on different physically relevant LR\ncovariates.",

          "description": "Recognition problems in long-tailed data, where the sample size per class is\nheavily skewed, have recently gained importance because the distribution of the\nsample size per class in a dataset is generally exponential unless the sample\nsize is intentionally adjusted. Various approaches have been devised to address\nthese problems. Recently, weight balancing, which combines well-known classical\nregularization techniques with two-stage training, has been proposed. Despite\nits simplicity, it is known for its high performance against existing methods\ndevised in various ways. However, there is a lack of understanding as to why\nthis approach is effective for long-tailed data. In this study, we analyze the\nmethod focusing on neural collapse and cone effect at each training stage and\nfind that it can be decomposed into the increase in Fisher's discriminant ratio\nof the feature extractor caused by weight decay and cross entropy loss and\nimplicit logit adjustment caused by weight decay and class-balanced loss.

          "description": "Secure aggregation is a critical component in federated learning (FL), which\nenables the server to learn the aggregate model of the users without observing\ntheir local models. Conventionally, secure aggregation algorithms focus only on\nensuring the privacy of individual users in a single training round. We contend\nthat such designs can lead to significant privacy leakages over multiple\ntraining rounds, due to partial user selection/participation at each round of\nFL. In fact, we show that the conventional random user selection strategies in\nFL lead to leaking users' individual models within number of rounds that is\nlinear in the number of users. To address this challenge, we introduce a secure\naggregation framework, Multi-RoundSecAgg, with multi-round privacy guarantees.\nIn particular, we introduce a new metric to quantify the privacy guarantees of\nFL over multiple training rounds, and develop a structured user selection\nstrategy that guarantees the long-term privacy of each user (over any number of\ntraining rounds). Our framework also carefully accounts for the fairness and\nthe average number of participating users at each round. Our experiments on\nMNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets in the IID and the non-IID settings demonstrate the\nperformance improvement over the baselines, both in terms of privacy protection\nand test accuracy.",

          "description": "Prompt learning approaches have made waves in natural language processing by\ninducing better few-shot performance while they still follow a parametric-based\nlearning paradigm; the oblivion and rote memorization problems in learning may\nencounter unstable generalization issues. Specifically, vanilla prompt learning\nmay struggle to utilize atypical instances by rote during fully-supervised\ntraining or overfit shallow patterns with low-shot data. To alleviate such\nlimitations, we develop RetroPrompt with the motivation of decoupling knowledge\nfrom memorization to help the model strike a balance between generalization and\nmemorization. In contrast with vanilla prompt learning, RetroPrompt constructs\nan open-book knowledge-store from training instances and implements a retrieval\nmechanism during the process of input, training and inference, thus equipping\nthe model with the ability to retrieve related contexts from the training\ncorpus as cues for enhancement. Extensive experiments demonstrate that\nRetroPrompt can obtain better performance in both few-shot and zero-shot\nsettings. Besides, we further illustrate that our proposed RetroPrompt can\nyield better generalization abilities with new datasets. Detailed analysis of\nmemorization indeed reveals RetroPrompt can reduce the reliance of language\nmodels on memorization; thus, improving generalization for downstream tasks.\nCode is available in\nhttps://github.com/zjunlp/PromptKG/tree/main/research/RetroPrompt.",

          "description": "Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) has emerged as a powerful solution for\nthe domain shift problem via transferring the knowledge from a labeled source\ndomain to a shifted unlabeled target domain. Despite the prevalence of UDA for\nvisual applications, it remains relatively less explored for time-series\napplications. In this work, we propose a novel lightweight contrastive domain\nadaptation framework called CoTMix for time-series data. Unlike existing\napproaches that either use statistical distances or adversarial techniques, we\nleverage contrastive learning solely to mitigate the distribution shift across\nthe different domains. Specifically, we propose a novel temporal mixup strategy\nto generate two intermediate augmented views for the source and target domains.\nSubsequently, we leverage contrastive learning to maximize the similarity\nbetween each domain and its corresponding augmented view. The generated views\nconsider the temporal dynamics of time-series data during the adaptation\nprocess while inheriting the semantics among the two domains. Hence, we\ngradually push both domains towards a common intermediate space, mitigating the\ndistribution shift across them. Extensive experiments conducted on five\nreal-world time-series datasets show that our approach can significantly\noutperform all state-of-the-art UDA methods.

          "description": "Many studies have proposed machine-learning (ML) models for malware detection\nand classification, reporting an almost-perfect performance. However, they\nassemble ground-truth in different ways, use diverse static- and\ndynamic-analysis techniques for feature extraction, and even differ on what\nthey consider a malware family. As a consequence, our community still lacks an\nunderstanding of malware classification results: whether they are tied to the\nnature and distribution of the collected dataset, to what extent the number of\nfamilies and samples in the training dataset influence performance, and how\nwell static and dynamic features complement each other.\n\nThis work sheds light on those open questions. by investigating the key\nfactors influencing ML-based malware detection and classification. For this, we\ncollect the largest balanced malware dataset so far with 67K samples from 670\nfamilies (100 samples each), and train state-of-the-art models for malware\ndetection and family classification using our dataset. Our results reveal that\nstatic features perform better than dynamic features, and that combining both\nonly provides marginal improvement over static features. We discover no\ncorrelation between packing and classification accuracy, and that missing\nbehaviors in dynamically-extracted features highly penalize their performance.\nWe also demonstrate how a larger number of families to classify make the\nclassification harder, while a higher number of samples per family increases\naccuracy. Finally, we find that models trained on a uniform distribution of\nsamples per family better generalize on unseen data.",

We investigate a classic hydrodynamic model of\nself-propelled particles that produces a wide variety of patterns, like asters\nand moving density bands. Our data-driven analysis shows that propagating bands\nare formed by local alignment interactions driven by density gradients, while\nsteady-state asters are shaped by a mechanism of splay-induced negative\ncompressibility arising from strong particle interactions. Our method also\nreveals analogous physical principles of pattern formation in a system where\nthe speed of the particle is influenced by local density.

          "description": "Approaches to recommendation are typically evaluated in one of two ways: (1)\nvia a (simulated) online experiment, often seen as the gold standard, or (2)\nvia some offline evaluation procedure, where the goal is to approximate the\noutcome of an online experiment. Several offline evaluation metrics have been\nadopted in the literature, inspired by ranking metrics prevalent in the field\nof Information Retrieval. (Normalised) Discounted Cumulative Gain (nDCG) is one\nsuch metric that has seen widespread adoption in empirical studies, and higher\n(n)DCG values have been used to present new methods as the state-of-the-art in\ntop-$n$ recommendation for many years.\n\nOur work takes a critical look at this approach, and investigates when we can\nexpect such metrics to approximate the gold standard outcome of an online\nexperiment. We formally present the assumptions that are necessary to consider\nDCG an unbiased estimator of online reward and provide a derivation for this\nmetric from first principles, highlighting where we deviate from its\ntraditional uses in IR. Importantly, we show that normalising the metric\nrenders it inconsistent, in that even when DCG is unbiased, ranking competing\nmethods by their normalised DCG can invert their relative order. Through a\ncorrelation analysis between off- and on-line experiments conducted on a\nlarge-scale recommendation platform, we show that our unbiased DCG estimates\nstrongly correlate with online reward, even when some of the metric's inherent\nassumptions are violated. This statement no longer holds for its normalised\nvariant, suggesting that nDCG's practical utility may be limited.",

          "description": "It has long been believed that the brain is highly modular both in terms of\nstructure and function, although recent evidence has led some to question the\nextent of both types of modularity. We used artificial neural networks to test\nthe hypothesis that structural modularity is sufficient to guarantee functional\nspecialization, and find that in general, this doesn't necessarily hold except\nat extreme levels. We then systematically tested which features of the\nenvironment and network do lead to the emergence of specialization. We used a\nsimple toy environment, task and network, allowing us precise control, and show\nthat in this setup, several distinct measures of specialization give\nqualitatively similar results. We further find that (1) specialization can only\nemerge in environments where features of that environment are meaningfully\nseparable, (2) specialization preferentially emerges when the network is\nstrongly resource-constrained, and (3) these findings are qualitatively similar\nacross different network architectures, but the quantitative relationships\ndepends on the architecture type. Finally, we show that functional\nspecialization varies dynamically across time, and demonstrate that these\ndynamics depend on both the timing and bandwidth of information flow in the\nnetwork. We conclude that a static notion of specialization, based on\nstructural modularity, is likely too simple a framework for understanding\nintelligent systems in situations of real-world complexity. We propose that\nthoroughly stress testing candidate definitions of functional modularity in\nsimplified scenarios before extending to more complex data, network models and\nelectrophysiological recordings is likely to be a fruitful approach.",

          "description": "Training reinforcement learning (RL) agents using scalar reward signals is\noften infeasible when an environment has sparse and non-Markovian rewards.\nMoreover, handcrafting these reward functions before training is prone to\nmisspecification, especially when the environment's dynamics are only partially\nknown. This paper proposes a novel pipeline for learning non-Markovian task\nspecifications as succinct finite-state `task automata' from episodes of agent\nexperience within unknown environments. We leverage two key algorithmic\ninsights. First, we learn a product MDP, a model composed of the\nspecification's automaton and the environment's MDP (both initially unknown),\nby treating the product MDP as a partially observable MDP and using the\nwell-known Baum-Welch algorithm for learning hidden Markov models. Second, we\npropose a novel method for distilling the task automaton (assumed to be a\ndeterministic finite automaton) from the learnt product MDP. Our learnt task\nautomaton enables the decomposition of a task into its constituent sub-tasks,\nwhich improves the rate at which an RL agent can later synthesise an optimal\npolicy. It also provides an interpretable encoding of high-level environmental\nand task features, so a human can readily verify that the agent has learnt\ncoherent tasks with no misspecifications. In addition, we take steps towards\nensuring that the learnt automaton is environment-agnostic, making it\nwell-suited for use in transfer learning.

The widely used\nMNIST dataset, which is commonly employed as a benchmark for this task,\nincludes distorted digits with irregular shapes, incomplete strokes, and\nvarying skew in both the training and testing datasets. Consequently, these\nfactors contribute to reduced accuracy in digit recognition. To overcome this\nchallenge, we propose a two-stage deep learning approach. In the first stage,\nwe create a simple neural network to identify distorted digits within the\ntraining set. This model serves to detect and filter out such distorted and\nambiguous images. In the second stage, we exclude these identified images from\nthe training dataset and proceed to retrain the model using the filtered\ndataset. This process aims to improve the classification accuracy and\nconfidence levels while mitigating issues of underfitting and overfitting. Our\nexperimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach,\nachieving an accuracy rate of over 99.5% on the testing dataset.

          "description": "Relational tables, where each row corresponds to an entity and each column\ncorresponds to an attribute, have been the standard for tables in relational\ndatabases. However, such a standard cannot be taken for granted when dealing\nwith tables \"in the wild\". Our survey of real spreadsheet-tables and web-tables\nshows that over 30% of such tables do not conform to the relational standard,\nfor which complex table-restructuring transformations are needed before these\ntables can be queried easily using SQL-based analytics tools. Unfortunately,\nthe required transformations are non-trivial to program, which has become a\nsubstantial pain point for technical and non-technical users alike, as\nevidenced by large numbers of forum questions in places like StackOverflow and\nExcel/Tableau forums.\n\nWe develop an Auto-Tables system that can automatically synthesize pipelines\nwith multi-step transformations (in Python or other languages), to transform\nnon-relational tables into standard relational forms for downstream analytics,\nobviating the need for users to manually program transformations. We compile an\nextensive benchmark for this new task, by collecting 194 real test cases from\nuser spreadsheets and online forums. Our evaluation suggests that Auto-Tables\ncan successfully synthesize transformations for over 70% of test cases at\ninteractive speeds, without requiring any input from users, making this an\neffective tool for both technical and non-technical users to prepare data for\nanalytics.",

Efficient and accurate load monitoring\nfacilitates user profile establishment, intelligent household energy\nmanagement, and peak load shifting. This is beneficial for both the end-users\nand utilities by improving the overall efficiency of a power distribution\nnetwork.

A major challenge for making accurate and robust\naction predictions is the problem of confounding, which if left untreated can\nlead to prediction errors. The partially observable Markov decision process\n(POMDP) is a widely-used framework to model these stochastic and\npartially-observable decision-making problems. However, due to a lack of\nexplicit causal semantics, POMDP planning methods are prone to confounding bias\nand thus in the presence of unobserved confounders may produce underperforming\npolicies. This paper presents a novel causally-informed extension of \"anytime\nregularized determinized sparse partially observable tree\" (AR-DESPOT), a\nmodern anytime online POMDP planner, using causal modelling and inference to\neliminate errors caused by unmeasured confounder variables. We further propose\na method to learn offline the partial parameterisation of the causal model for\nplanning, from ground truth model data. We evaluate our methods on a toy\nproblem with an unobserved confounder and show that the learned causal model is\nhighly accurate, while our planning method is more robust to confounding and\nproduces overall higher performing policies than AR-DESPOT.",

          "description": "Residual connections have been proposed as architecture-based inductive bias\nto mitigate the problem of exploding and vanishing gradients and increase task\nperformance in both feed-forward and recurrent networks (RNNs) when trained\nwith the backpropagation algorithm. Yet, little is known about how residual\nconnections in RNNs influence their dynamics and fading memory properties.\nHere, we introduce weakly coupled residual recurrent networks (WCRNNs) in which\nresidual connections result in well-defined Lyapunov exponents and allow for\nstudying properties of fading memory. We investigate how the residual\nconnections of WCRNNs influence their performance, network dynamics, and memory\nproperties on a set of benchmark tasks. We show that several distinct forms of\nresidual connections yield effective inductive biases that result in increased\nnetwork expressivity. In particular, residual connections that (i) result in\nnetwork dynamics at the proximity of the edge of chaos, (ii) allow networks to\ncapitalize on characteristic spectral properties of the data, and (iii) result\nin heterogeneous memory properties are shown to increase practical\nexpressivity. In addition, we demonstrate how our results can be extended to\nnon-linear residuals and introduce a weakly coupled residual initialization\nscheme that can be used for Elman RNNs",

          "description": "With the increased deployment of machine learning models in various\nreal-world applications, researchers and practitioners alike have emphasized\nthe need for explanations of model behaviour. To this end, two broad strategies\nhave been outlined in prior literature to explain models. Post hoc explanation\nmethods explain the behaviour of complex black-box models by highlighting\nfeatures that are critical to model predictions; however, prior work has shown\nthat these explanations may not be faithful, and even more concerning is our\ninability to verify them. Specifically, it is nontrivial to evaluate if a given\nattribution is correct with respect to the underlying model. Inherently\ninterpretable models, on the other hand, circumvent these issues by explicitly\nencoding explanations into model architecture, meaning their explanations are\nnaturally faithful and verifiable, but they often exhibit poor predictive\nperformance due to their limited expressive power. In this work, we aim to\nbridge the gap between the aforementioned strategies by proposing Verifiability\nTuning (VerT), a method that transforms black-box models into models that\nnaturally yield faithful and verifiable feature attributions. We begin by\nintroducing a formal theoretical framework to understand verifiability and show\nthat attributions produced by standard models cannot be verified. We then\nleverage this framework to propose a method to build verifiable models and\nfeature attributions out of fully trained black-box models. Finally, we perform\nextensive experiments on semi-synthetic and real-world datasets, and show that\nVerT produces models that (1) yield explanations that are correct and\nverifiable and (2) are faithful to the original black-box models they are meant\nto explain.",

This trade-off is typically enabled by a scaling rule, for\nexample, in stochastic gradient descent, one should scale the learning rate\nlinearly with the batch size. Another important tool for practical machine\nlearning is the model Exponential Moving Average (EMA), which is a model copy\nthat does not receive gradient information, but instead follows its target\nmodel with some momentum. This model EMA can improve the robustness and\ngeneralization properties of supervised learning, stabilize pseudo-labeling,\nand provide a learning signal for Self-Supervised Learning (SSL). Prior works\nhave treated the model EMA separately from optimization, leading to different\ntraining dynamics across batch sizes and lower model performance. In this work,\nwe provide a scaling rule for optimization in the presence of model EMAs and\ndemonstrate its validity across a range of architectures, optimizers, and data\nmodalities. We also show the rule's validity where the model EMA contributes to\nthe optimization of the target model, enabling us to train EMA-based\npseudo-labeling and SSL methods at small and large batch sizes.

          "description": "The UNet architecture, based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), has\ndemonstrated its remarkable performance in medical image analysis. However, it\nfaces challenges in capturing long-range dependencies due to the limited\nreceptive fields and inherent bias of convolutional operations. Recently,\nnumerous transformer-based techniques have been incorporated into the UNet\narchitecture to overcome this limitation by effectively capturing global\nfeature correlations. However, the integration of the Transformer modules may\nresult in the loss of local contextual information during the global feature\nfusion process. To overcome these challenges, we propose a 2D medical image\nsegmentation model called Multi-scale Cross Perceptron Attention Network\n(MCPA). The MCPA consists of three main components: an encoder, a decoder, and\na Cross Perceptron. The Cross Perceptron first captures the local correlations\nusing multiple Multi-scale Cross Perceptron modules, facilitating the fusion of\nfeatures across scales. The resulting multi-scale feature vectors are then\nspatially unfolded, concatenated, and fed through a Global Perceptron module to\nmodel global dependencies. Furthermore, we introduce a Progressive Dual-branch\nStructure to address the semantic segmentation of the image involving finer\ntissue structures. This structure gradually shifts the segmentation focus of\nMCPA network training from large-scale structural features to more\nsophisticated pixel-level features. We evaluate our proposed MCPA model on\nseveral publicly available medical image datasets from different tasks and\ndevices, including the open large-scale dataset of CT (Synapse), MRI (ACDC),\nfundus camera (DRIVE, CHASE_DB1, HRF), and OCTA (ROSE).

          "description": "Augmentation techniques and sampling strategies are crucial in contrastive\nlearning, but in most existing works, augmentation techniques require careful\ndesign, and their sampling strategies can only capture a small amount of\nintrinsic supervision information. Additionally, the existing methods require\ncomplex designs to obtain two different representations of the data. To\novercome these limitations, we propose a novel framework called the\nSelf-Contrastive Graph Diffusion Network (SCGDN). Our framework consists of two\nmain components: the Attentional Module (AttM) and the Diffusion Module (DiFM).\nAttM aggregates higher-order structure and feature information to get an\nexcellent embedding, while DiFM balances the state of each node in the graph\nthrough Laplacian diffusion learning and allows the cooperative evolution of\nadjacency and feature information in the graph. Unlike existing methodologies,\nSCGDN is an augmentation-free approach that avoids \"sampling bias\" and semantic\ndrift, without the need for pre-training. We conduct a high-quality sampling of\nsamples based on structure and feature information. If two nodes are neighbors,\nthey are considered positive samples of each other. If two disconnected nodes\nare also unrelated on $k$NN graph, they are considered negative samples for\neach other. The contrastive objective reasonably uses our proposed sampling\nstrategies, and the redundancy reduction term minimizes redundant information\nin the embedding and can well retain more discriminative information. In this\nnovel framework, the graph self-contrastive learning paradigm gives expression\nto a powerful force. SCGDN effectively balances between preserving high-order\nstructure information and avoiding overfitting. The results manifest that SCGDN\ncan consistently generate outperformance over both the contrastive methods and\nthe classical methods.",

In particular, we\nfocus on solving a finite sum-of-terms problem, also known as empirical risk\nminimization. We first detail an idealized adaptive method called\n$\\texttt{SPS}_+$ that makes use of the sampled loss values and assumes\nknowledge of the sampled loss at optimality. This $\\texttt{SPS}_+$ is a minor\nmodification of the SPS (Stochastic Polyak Stepsize) method, where the step\nsize is enforced to be positive. We then show that $\\texttt{SPS}_+$ achieves\nthe best known rates of convergence for SGD in the Lipschitz non-smooth. We\nthen move onto to develop $\\texttt{FUVAL}$, a variant of $\\texttt{SPS}_+$ where\nthe loss values at optimality are gradually learned, as opposed to being given.\nWe give three viewpoints of $\\texttt{FUVAL}$, as a projection based method, as\na variant of the prox-linear method, and then as a particular online SGD\nmethod. We then present a convergence analysis of $\\texttt{FUVAL}$ and\nexperimental results. The shortcomings of our work is that the convergence\nanalysis of $\\texttt{FUVAL}$ shows no advantage over SGD. Another shortcomming\nis that currently only the full batch version of $\\texttt{FUVAL}$ shows a minor\nadvantages of GD (Gradient Descent) in terms of sensitivity to the step size.\nThe stochastic version shows no clear advantage over SGD. We conjecture that\nlarge mini-batches are required to make $\\texttt{FUVAL}$ competitive.\n\nCurrently the new $\\texttt{FUVAL}$ method studied in this paper does not\noffer any clear theoretical or practical advantage. We have chosen to make this\ndraft available online nonetheless because of some of the analysis techniques\nwe use, such as the non-smooth analysis of $\\texttt{SPS}_+$, and also to show\nan apparently interesting approach that currently does not work.",

          "description": "Rapid growth of applying Machine Learning (ML) in different domains,\nespecially in safety-critical areas, increases the need for reliable ML\ncomponents, i.e., a software component operating based on ML. Understanding the\nbugs characteristics and maintenance challenges in ML-based systems can help\ndevelopers of these systems to identify where to focus maintenance and testing\nefforts, by giving insights into the most error-prone components, most common\nbugs, etc. In this paper, we investigate the characteristics of bugs in\nML-based software systems and the difference between ML and non-ML bugs from\nthe maintenance viewpoint. We extracted 447,948 GitHub repositories that used\none of the three most popular ML frameworks, i.e., TensorFlow, Keras, and\nPyTorch. After multiple filtering steps, we select the top 300 repositories\nwith the highest number of closed issues. We manually investigate the extracted\nrepositories to exclude non-ML-based systems. Our investigation involved a\nmanual inspection of 386 sampled reported issues in the identified ML-based\nsystems to indicate whether they affect ML components or not. Our analysis\nshows that nearly half of the real issues reported in ML-based systems are ML\nbugs, indicating that ML components are more error-prone than non-ML\ncomponents. Next, we thoroughly examined 109 identified ML bugs to identify\ntheir root causes, symptoms, and calculate their required fixing time. The\nresults also revealed that ML bugs have significantly different characteristics\ncompared to non-ML bugs, in terms of the complexity of bug-fixing (number of\ncommits, changed files, and changed lines of code). Based on our results,\nfixing ML bugs are more costly and ML components are more error-prone, compared\nto non-ML bugs and non-ML components respectively. Hence, paying a significant\nattention to the reliability of the ML components is crucial in ML-based\nsystems.",

However, existing\nfilter-based feature selection methods cannot directly measure redundancy for\ncontinuous data.

In this paper, we propose a non-parametric feature selection\nalgorithm based on maximum inter-class variation and minimum redundancy,\nabbreviated as MVMR-FS. We first introduce supervised and unsupervised kernel\ndensity estimation on the features to capture their similarities and\ndifferences in inter-class and overall distributions. Subsequently, we present\nthe criteria for maximum inter-class variation and minimum redundancy (MVMR),\nwherein the inter-class probability distributions are employed to reflect\nfeature relevance and the distances between overall probability distributions\nare used to quantify redundancy.

          "description": "Counterfactual examples have emerged as an effective approach to produce\nsimple and understandable post-hoc explanations. In the context of graph\nclassification, previous work has focused on generating counterfactual\nexplanations by manipulating the most elementary units of a graph, i.e.,\nremoving an existing edge, or adding a non-existing one. In this paper, we\nclaim that such language of explanation might be too fine-grained, and turn our\nattention to some of the main characterizing features of real-world complex\nnetworks, such as the tendency to close triangles, the existence of recurring\nmotifs, and the organization into dense modules. We thus define a general\ndensity-based counterfactual search framework to generate instance-level\ncounterfactual explanations for graph classifiers, which can be instantiated\nwith different notions of dense substructures. In particular, we show two\nspecific instantiations of this general framework: a method that searches for\ncounterfactual graphs by opening or closing triangles, and a method driven by\nmaximal cliques. We also discuss how the general method can be instantiated to\nexploit any other notion of dense substructures, including, for instance, a\ngiven taxonomy of nodes. We evaluate the effectiveness of our approaches in 7\nbrain network datasets and compare the counterfactual statements generated\naccording to several widely-used metrics. Results confirm that adopting a\nsemantic-relevant unit of change like density is essential to define versatile\nand interpretable counterfactual explanation methods.",

          "description": "Complex interactions between two opposing agents frequently occur in domains\nof machine learning, game theory, and other application domains. Quantitatively\nanalyzing the strategies involved can provide an objective basis for\ndecision-making. One such critical scenario is shot-taking in football, where\ndecisions, such as whether the attacker should shoot or pass the ball and\nwhether the defender should attempt to block the shot, play a crucial role in\nthe outcome of the game. However, there are currently no effective data-driven\nand/or theory-based approaches to analyzing such situations. To address this\nissue, we proposed a novel framework to analyze such scenarios based on game\ntheory, where we estimate the expected payoff with machine learning (ML)\nmodels, and additional features for ML models were extracted with a\ntheory-based shot block model. Conventionally, successes or failures (1 or 0)\nare used as payoffs, while a success shot (goal) is extremely rare in football.\nTherefore, we proposed the Expected Probability of Shot On Target (xSOT) metric\nto evaluate players' actions even if the shot results in no goal; this allows\nfor effective differentiation and comparison between different shots and even\nenables counterfactual shot situation analysis. In our experiments, we have\nvalidated the framework by comparing it with baseline and ablated models.\nFurthermore, we have observed a high correlation between the xSOT and existing\nmetrics. This alignment of information suggests that xSOT provides valuable\ninsights.

          "description": "Turbulence parametrizations will remain a necessary building block in\nkilometer-scale Earth system models. In convective boundary layers, where the\nmean vertical gradients of conserved properties such as potential temperature\nand moisture are approximately zero, the standard ansatz which relates\nturbulent fluxes to mean vertical gradients via an eddy diffusivity has to be\nextended by mass flux parametrizations for the typically asymmetric up- and\ndowndrafts in the atmospheric boundary layer. In this work, we present a\nparametrization for a dry convective boundary layer based on a generative\nadversarial network. The model incorporates the physics of self-similar layer\ngrowth following from the classical mixed layer theory by Deardorff. This\nenhances the training data base of the generative machine learning algorithm\nand thus significantly improves the predicted statistics of the synthetically\ngenerated turbulence fields at different heights inside the boundary layer. The\nalgorithm training is based on fully three-dimensional direct numerical\nsimulation data. Differently to stochastic parametrizations, our model is able\nto predict the highly non-Gaussian transient statistics of buoyancy\nfluctuations, vertical velocity, and buoyancy flux at different heights thus\nalso capturing the fastest thermals penetrating into the stabilized top region.\nThe results of our generative algorithm agree with standard two-equation or\nmulti-plume stochastic mass-flux schemes. The present parametrization provides\nadditionally the granule-type horizontal organization of the turbulent\nconvection which cannot be obtained in any of the other model closures. Our\nwork paves the way to efficient data-driven convective parametrizations in\nother natural flows, such as moist convection, upper ocean mixing, or\nconvection in stellar interiors.",

This approach eliminates the need for hand-crafted planning\nalgorithms by enabling the agent to learn how to plan autonomously and allows\nfor easy interpretation of the agent's plan with visualization. We demonstrate\nthe algorithm's effectiveness through experimental results in the game of\nSokoban and the Atari 2600 benchmark, where the Thinker algorithm achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance and competitive results, respectively.\nVisualizations of agents trained with the Thinker algorithm demonstrate that\nthey have learned to plan effectively with the world model to select better\nactions. The algorithm's generality opens a new research direction on how a\nworld model can be used in reinforcement learning and how planning can be\nseamlessly integrated into an agent's decision-making process.",

Existing experimental datasets are often restricted, with limited\navailability and sparse ground truth data, impeding our understanding of this\ncomplex multi-physics phenomena. To bridge this gap, we present the BubbleML\nDataset(https://github.com/HPCForge/BubbleML) which leverages physics-driven\nsimulations to provide accurate ground truth information for various boiling\nscenarios, encompassing nucleate pool boiling, flow boiling, and sub-cooled\nboiling. This extensive dataset covers a wide range of parameters, including\nvarying gravity conditions, flow rates, sub-cooling levels, and wall superheat,\ncomprising 51 simulations. BubbleML is validated against experimental\nobservations and trends, establishing it as an invaluable resource for ML\nresearch. Furthermore, we showcase its potential to facilitate exploration of\ndiverse downstream tasks by introducing two benchmarks: (a) optical flow\nanalysis to capture bubble dynamics, and (b) operator networks for learning\ntemperature dynamics.

Nonetheless, there is a\nlack of works that consider graph representations in the context of deep\nlearning systems for music generation. This paper bridges this gap by\nintroducing a novel graph representation for music and a deep Variational\nAutoencoder that generates the structure and the content of musical graphs\nseparately, one after the other, with a hierarchical architecture that matches\nthe structural priors of music. By separating the structure and content of\nmusical graphs, it is possible to condition generation by specifying which\ninstruments are played at certain times. This opens the door to a new form of\nhuman-computer interaction in the context of music co-creation. After training\nthe model on existing MIDI datasets, the experiments show that the model is\nable to generate appealing short and long musical sequences and to\nrealistically interpolate between them, producing music that is tonally and\nrhythmically consistent. Finally, the visualization of the embeddings shows\nthat the model is able to organize its latent space in accordance with known\nmusical concepts.",

Accurate information of heat extremes is needed to support\nthe development of actionable mitigation and adaptation strategies. Regional\nclimate models are commonly used to better understand the dynamics of these\nevents. These models have very large input parameter sets, and the parameters\nwithin the physics schemes substantially influence the model's performance.\nHowever, parameter sensitivity analysis (SA) of regional models for heat\nextremes is largely unexplored. Here, we focus on the southeast Australian\nregion, one of the global hotspots of heat extremes. In southeast Australia\nWeather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model is the widely used regional model\nto simulate extreme weather events across the region. Hence in this study, we\nfocus on the sensitivity of WRF model parameters to surface meteorological\nvariables such as temperature, relative humidity, and wind speed during two\nextreme heat events over southeast Australia. Due to the presence of multiple\nparameters and their complex relationship with output variables, a machine\nlearning (ML) surrogate-based global sensitivity analysis method is considered\nfor the SA. The ML surrogate-based Sobol SA is used to identify the sensitivity\nof 24 adjustable parameters in seven different physics schemes of the WRF\nmodel. Results show that out of these 24, only three parameters, namely the\nscattering tuning parameter, multiplier of saturated soil water content, and\nprofile shape exponent in the momentum diffusivity coefficient, are important\nfor the considered meteorological variables. These SA results are consistent\nfor the two different extreme heat events. Further, we investigated the\nphysical significance of sensitive parameters. This study's results will help\nin further optimising WRF parameters to improve model simulation.",

To tackle this challenge, active learning algorithms are\ncommonly employed to select only the most relevant data for labeling. However,\nthis is possible only when the quality and quantity of labels acquired from\nexperts are sufficient. Unfortunately, in many applications, a trade-off\nbetween annotating individual samples by multiple annotators to increase label\nquality vs. annotating new samples to increase the total number of labeled\ninstances is necessary. In this paper, we address the issue of faulty data\nannotations in the context of active learning. In particular, we propose two\nnovel annotation unification algorithms that utilize unlabeled parts of the\nsample space.

Recent\nproposals on Spatial-Temporal Graph Neural Networks (STGNNs) have made\nsignificant progress by combining sequential models with graph convolution\nnetworks. However, due to high complexity issues, STGNNs only focus on\nshort-term traffic forecasting, e.g., 1-hour forecasting, while ignoring more\npractical long-term forecasting. In this paper, we make the first attempt to\nexplore long-term traffic forecasting, e.g., 1-day forecasting. To this end, we\nfirst reveal its unique challenges in exploiting multi-scale representations.\nThen, we propose a novel Hierarchical U-net TransFormer (HUTFormer) to address\nthe issues of long-term traffic forecasting. HUTFormer consists of a\nhierarchical encoder and decoder to jointly generate and utilize multi-scale\nrepresentations of traffic data. Specifically, for the encoder, we propose\nwindow self-attention and segment merging to extract multi-scale\nrepresentations from long-term traffic data. For the decoder, we design a\ncross-scale attention mechanism to effectively incorporate multi-scale\nrepresentations. In addition, HUTFormer employs an efficient input embedding\nstrategy to address the complexity issues.

In this paper, we focus on the bipartite ranking\nscenario, where the instances come from either the positive or negative class\nand the goal is to learn a ranking function that ranks positive instances\nhigher than negative ones. While there could be a trade-off between fairness\nand performance, we propose a model agnostic post-processing framework xOrder\nfor achieving fairness in bipartite ranking and maintaining the algorithm\nclassification performance. In particular, we optimize a weighted sum of the\nutility as identifying an optimal warping path across different protected\ngroups and solve it through a dynamic programming process. xOrder is compatible\nwith various classification models and ranking fairness metrics, including\nsupervised and unsupervised fairness metrics. In addition to binary groups,\nxOrder can be applied to multiple protected groups. We evaluate our proposed\nalgorithm on four benchmark data sets and two real-world patient electronic\nhealth record repositories. xOrder consistently achieves a better balance\nbetween the algorithm utility and ranking fairness on a variety of datasets\nwith different metrics. From the visualization of the calibrated ranking\nscores, xOrder mitigates the score distribution shifts of different groups\ncompared with baselines. Moreover, additional analytical results verify that\nxOrder achieves a robust performance when faced with fewer samples and a bigger\ndifference between training and testing ranking score distributions.",

Most approaches along\nthese lines have focused on simple descriptions, which are not always useful\nfor varying types of input mixtures. In this work, we present an approach in\nwhich a model, given an input mixture and partial semantic information about a\ntarget source, is trained to extract additional semantic data. We then leverage\nthis pre-trained model to improve the separation performance of an uncoupled\nmulti-conditional separation network. Our experiments demonstrate that the\nseparation performance of this multi-conditional model is significantly\nimproved, approaching the performance of an oracle model with complete semantic\ninformation.

          "description": "To ensure the reliable use of classification systems in medical applications,\nit is crucial to prevent silent failures. This can be achieved by either\ndesigning classifiers that are robust enough to avoid failures in the first\nplace, or by detecting remaining failures using confidence scoring functions\n(CSFs). A predominant source of failures in image classification is\ndistribution shifts between training data and deployment data. To understand\nthe current state of silent failure prevention in medical imaging, we conduct\nthe first comprehensive analysis comparing various CSFs in four biomedical\ntasks and a diverse range of distribution shifts. Based on the result that none\nof the benchmarked CSFs can reliably prevent silent failures, we conclude that\na deeper understanding of the root causes of failures in the data is required.\nTo facilitate this, we introduce SF-Visuals, an interactive analysis tool that\nuses latent space clustering to visualize shifts and failures.

In recent years, significant progress has been made in this field\nthrough the development of various machine learning approaches. However, most\nexisting methods formulate the task as a multi-classification problem, i.e\nassigning predefined labels to proteins. In this work, we propose a novel\napproach, \\textbf{Prot2Text}, which predicts a protein function's in a free\ntext style, moving beyond the conventional binary or categorical\nclassifications. By combining Graph Neural Networks(GNNs) and Large Language\nModels(LLMs), in an encoder-decoder framework, our model effectively integrates\ndiverse data types including proteins' sequences, structures, and textual\nannotations. This multimodal approach allows for a holistic representation of\nproteins' functions, enabling the generation of detailed and accurate\ndescriptions. To evaluate our model, we extracted a multimodal protein dataset\nfrom SwissProt, and demonstrate empirically the effectiveness of Prot2Text.\nThese results highlight the transformative impact of multimodal models,\nspecifically the fusion of GNNs and LLMs, empowering researchers with powerful\ntools for more accurate prediction of proteins' functions.

However, implementation of FL over modern wireless networks faces\nkey challenges caused by (i) dynamics of the network conditions and (ii) the\ncoexistence of multiple FL services/tasks and other network services in the\nsystem, which are not jointly considered in prior works. Motivated by these\nchallenges, we introduce a generic FL paradigm over NextG networks, called\ndynamic multi-service FL (DMS-FL). We identify three unexplored design\nconsiderations in DMS-FL: (i) FL service operator accumulation, (ii) wireless\nresource fragmentation, and (iii) signal strength fluctuations. We take the\nfirst steps towards addressing these design considerations by proposing a novel\ndistributed ML architecture called elastic virtualized FL (EV-FL). EV-FL\nunleashes the full potential of Open RAN (O-RAN) systems and introduces an\nelastic resource provisioning methodology to execute FL services. It further\nconstitutes a multi-time-scale FL management system that introduces three\ndimensions into existing FL architectures: (i) virtualization, (ii)\nscalability, and (iii) elasticity. Through investigating EV-FL, we reveal a\nseries of open research directions for future work.

Conceptualized within the theoretical framework of\nCumulative Prospect Theory, the model integrates key cognitive biases with\ncomputational linguistics and natural language processing to develop a\nmultidimensional perspective on information engagement. A rigorous testing\nprotocol was implemented, involving 50 randomly selected pairs of synonymous\nwords (100 words in total) from the WordNet database. These words' engagement\nlevels were evaluated through a large-scale online survey (n = 80,500) to\nderive empirical IE metrics. The READ attributes for each word were then\ncomputed and their predictive efficacy examined. The findings affirm the READ\nmodel's robustness, accurately predicting a word's IE level and distinguishing\nthe more engaging word from a pair of synonyms with an 84% accuracy rate. The\nREAD model's potential extends across various domains, including business,\neducation, government, and healthcare, where it could enhance content\nengagement and inform AI language model development and generative text work.\nFuture research should address the model's scalability and adaptability across\ndifferent domains and languages, thereby broadening its applicability and\nefficacy.",

The\nutility of such an examiner is demonstrated for verifying automatically\ngenerated reports by detecting and removing fake sentences.

Such corruption often arises unexpectedly and alters the\nmodel's performance. In recent years, the primary focus has been on adversarial\nattacks. However, natural corruptions (e.g., snow, fog, dust) are an\nomnipresent threat to visual AI systems and should be considered equally\nimportant. Many existing works propose interesting solutions to train robust\nmodels against natural corruption. These works either leverage image\naugmentations, which come with the additional cost of model training, or place\nsuspicious patches in the scene to design unadversarial examples. In this work,\nwe propose the idea of naturalistic support artifacts (NSA) for robust\nprediction. The NSAs are shown to be beneficial in scenarios where model\nparameters are inaccessible and adding artifacts in the scene is feasible. The\nNSAs are natural looking objects generated through artifact training using\nDC-GAN to have high visual fidelity in the scene. We test against natural\ncorruptions on the Imagenette dataset and observe the improvement in prediction\nconfidence score by four times.

We start by considering the information\nprocessing capacity (IPC), a normalized measure of the expected squared error\nof a collection of signals to a complete basis of functions. We use the IPC to\nmeasure the degradation under noise of the performance of reservoir computers,\na particular kind of recurrent network, when constrained by physical\nconsiderations. First, we show that the IPC is at most a polynomial in the\nsystem size $n$, even when considering the collection of $2^n$ possible\npointwise products of the $n$ output signals. Next, we argue that this\ndegradation implies that the family of functions represented by the reservoir\nrequires an exponential number of samples to learn in the presence of the\nreservoir's noise. Finally, we conclude with a discussion of the performance of\nthe same collection of $2^n$ functions without noise when being used for binary\nclassification.",

          "description": "Neural operations that rely on neighborhood information are much more\nexpensive when deployed on point clouds than on grid data due to the irregular\ndistances between points in a point cloud. In a grid, on the other hand, we can\ncompute the kernel only once and reuse it for all query positions. As a result,\noperations that rely on neighborhood information scale much worse for point\nclouds than for grid data, specially for large inputs and large neighborhoods.\n\nIn this work, we address the scalability issue of point cloud methods by\ntackling its root cause: the irregularity of the data. We propose learnable\ngridification as the first step in a point cloud processing pipeline to\ntransform the point cloud into a compact, regular grid. Thanks to\ngridification, subsequent layers can use operations defined on regular grids,\ne.g., Conv3D, which scale much better than native point cloud methods. We then\nextend gridification to point cloud to point cloud tasks, e.g., segmentation,\nby adding a learnable de-gridification step at the end of the point cloud\nprocessing pipeline to map the compact, regular grid back to its original point\ncloud form. Through theoretical and empirical analysis, we show that gridified\nnetworks scale better in terms of memory and time than networks directly\napplied on raw point cloud data, while being able to achieve competitive\nresults.

          "description": "Big data and machine learning tools have jointly empowered humans in making\ndata-driven decisions. However, many of them capture empirical associations\nthat might be spurious due to confounding factors and subgroup heterogeneity.\nThe famous Simpson's paradox is such a phenomenon where aggregated and\nsubgroup-level associations contradict with each other, causing cognitive\nconfusions and difficulty in making adequate interpretations and decisions.\nExisting tools provide little insights for humans to locate, reason about, and\nprevent pitfalls of spurious association in practice. We propose VISPUR, a\nvisual analytic system that provides a causal analysis framework and a\nhuman-centric workflow for tackling spurious associations. These include a\nCONFOUNDER DASHBOARD, which can automatically identify possible confounding\nfactors, and a SUBGROUP VIEWER, which allows for the visualization and\ncomparison of diverse subgroup patterns that likely or potentially result in a\nmisinterpretation of causality. Additionally, we propose a REASONING\nSTORYBOARD, which uses a flow-based approach to illustrate paradoxical\nphenomena, as well as an interactive DECISION DIAGNOSIS panel that helps ensure\naccountable decision-making. Through an expert interview and a controlled user\nexperiment, our qualitative and quantitative results demonstrate that the\nproposed \"de-paradox\" workflow and the designed visual analytic system are\neffective in helping human users to identify and understand spurious\nassociations, as well as to make accountable causal decisions.",

The research focuses on the Power, Industry, Ground Transport, Domestic\nAviation, and International Aviation sectors in European countries (EU27 & UK,\nItaly, Germany, Spain) and India, utilizing near-real-time activity data from\nthe Carbon Monitor research initiative. To identify regular emission patterns,\nthe data from the year 2020 is excluded due to the disruptive effects caused by\nthe COVID-19 pandemic. The study then performs a principal component analysis\n(PCA) to determine the key contributors to CO$_2$ emissions. The analysis\nreveals that the Power, Industry, and Ground Transport sectors account for a\nsignificant portion of the variance in the dataset. A 7-day moving averaged\ndataset is employed for further analysis to facilitate robust predictions. This\ndataset captures both short-term and long-term trends and enhances the quality\nof the data for prediction purposes. The study utilizes Long Short-Term Memory\n(LSTM) models on the 7-day moving averaged dataset to effectively predict\nemissions and provide insights for policy decisions, mitigation strategies, and\nclimate change efforts. During the training phase, the stability and\nconvergence of the LSTM models are ensured, which guarantees their reliability\nin the testing phase. The evaluation of the loss function indicates this\nreliability. The model achieves high efficiency, as demonstrated by $R^2$\nvalues ranging from 0.8242 to 0.995 for various countries and sectors.\nFurthermore, there is a proposal for utilizing scandium and\nboron/aluminium-based thin films as exceptionally efficient materials for\ncapturing CO$_2$ (with a binding energy range from -3.0 to -3.5 eV).

When does understanding ML contracts require an advanced\nlevel of ML software expertise? Could checking contracts at the API level help\ndetect the violations in early ML pipeline stages? Our key findings are that\nthe most commonly needed contracts for ML APIs are either checking constraints\non single arguments of an API or on the order of API calls.

          "description": "Cardiac cine MRI is the gold standard for cardiac functional assessment, but\nthe inherently slow acquisition process creates the necessity of reconstruction\napproaches for accelerated undersampled acquisitions. Several regularization\napproaches that exploit spatial-temporal redundancy have been proposed to\nreconstruct undersampled cardiac cine MRI. More recently, methods based on\nsupervised deep learning have been also proposed to further accelerate\nacquisition and reconstruction. However, these techniques rely on usually large\ndataset for training, which are not always available. In this work, we propose\nan unsupervised approach based on implicit neural field representations for\ncardiac cine MRI (so called NF-cMRI). The proposed method was evaluated in\nin-vivo undersampled golden-angle radial multi-coil acquisitions for\nundersampling factors of 26x and 52x, achieving good image quality, and\ncomparable spatial and improved temporal depiction than a state-of-the-art\nreconstruction technique.",

Its applications can be found in various fields, from protein modeling\nto social network analysis. Recently, many papers appeared studying the problem\nof overlapping community detection, where each node of a network may belong to\nseveral communities. In this work, we consider Mixed-Membership Stochastic\nBlock Model (MMSB) first proposed by Airoldi et al. (2008). MMSB provides quite\na general setting for modeling overlapping community structure in graphs. The\ncentral question of this paper is to reconstruct relations between communities\ngiven an observed network.

In this\nwork, we propose a solution to this problem: a feed-forward neural network (NN)\ndesigned to predict a functional response using scalar inputs. First, we\ntransform the functional response to a finite-dimensional representation and\nconstruct an NN that outputs this representation. Then, we propose to modify\nthe output of an NN via the objective function and introduce different\nobjective functions for network training.

          "description": "In this work, we explore a framework for contextual decision-making to study\nhow the relevance and quantity of past data affects the performance of a\ndata-driven policy. We analyze a contextual Newsvendor problem in which a\ndecision-maker needs to trade-off between an underage and an overage cost in\nthe face of uncertain demand. We consider a setting in which past demands\nobserved under ``close by'' contexts come from close by distributions and\nanalyze the performance of data-driven algorithms through a notion of\ncontext-dependent worst-case expected regret. We analyze the broad class of\nWeighted Empirical Risk Minimization (WERM) policies which weigh past data\naccording to their similarity in the contextual space. This class includes\nclassical policies such as ERM, k-Nearest Neighbors and kernel-based policies.\nOur main methodological contribution is to characterize exactly the worst-case\nregret of any WERM policy on any given configuration of contexts. To the best\nof our knowledge, this provides the first understanding of tight performance\nguarantees in any contextual decision-making problem, with past literature\nfocusing on upper bounds via concentration inequalities. We instead take an\noptimization approach, and isolate a structure in the Newsvendor loss function\nthat allows to reduce the infinite-dimensional optimization problem over\nworst-case distributions to a simple line search.\n\nThis in turn allows us to unveil fundamental insights that were obfuscated by\nprevious general-purpose bounds.

FLARE is also robust to model modification attacks and cannot be\neasily evaded by more informed adversaries without negatively impacting agent\nperformance. We also show that not all universal adversarial masks are suitable\ncandidates for fingerprints due to the inherent characteristics of DRL\npolicies.

          "description": "Because \"out-of-the-box\" large language models are capable of generating a\ngreat deal of objectionable content, recent work has focused on aligning these\nmodels in an attempt to prevent undesirable generation. While there has been\nsome success at circumventing these measures -- so-called \"jailbreaks\" against\nLLMs -- these attacks have required significant human ingenuity and are brittle\nin practice. In this paper, we propose a simple and effective attack method\nthat causes aligned language models to generate objectionable behaviors.\nSpecifically, our approach finds a suffix that, when attached to a wide range\nof queries for an LLM to produce objectionable content, aims to maximize the\nprobability that the model produces an affirmative response (rather than\nrefusing to answer). However, instead of relying on manual engineering, our\napproach automatically produces these adversarial suffixes by a combination of\ngreedy and gradient-based search techniques, and also improves over past\nautomatic prompt generation methods.\n\nSurprisingly, we find that the adversarial prompts generated by our approach\nare quite transferable, including to black-box, publicly released LLMs.\nSpecifically, we train an adversarial attack suffix on multiple prompts (i.e.,\nqueries asking for many different types of objectionable content), as well as\nmultiple models (in our case, Vicuna-7B and 13B). When doing so, the resulting\nattack suffix is able to induce objectionable content in the public interfaces\nto ChatGPT, Bard, and Claude, as well as open source LLMs such as LLaMA-2-Chat,\nPythia, Falcon, and others.

          "description": "Autonomous systems in the road transportation network require intelligent\nmechanisms that cope with uncertainty to foresee the future. In this paper, we\npropose a multi-stage probabilistic approach for trajectory forecasting:\ntrajectory transformation to displacement space, clustering of displacement\ntime series, trajectory proposals, and ranking proposals. We introduce a new\ndeep feature clustering method, underlying self-conditioned GAN, which copes\nbetter with distribution shifts than traditional methods. Additionally, we\npropose novel distance-based ranking proposals to assign probabilities to the\ngenerated trajectories that are more efficient yet accurate than an auxiliary\nneural network. The overall system surpasses context-free deep generative\nmodels in human and road agents trajectory data while performing similarly to\npoint estimators when comparing the most probable trajectory.",

          "description": "Deep learning often faces the challenge of efficiently processing dynamic\ninputs, such as sensor data or user inputs. For example, an AI writing\nassistant is required to update its suggestions in real time as a document is\nedited. Re-running the model each time is expensive, even with compression\ntechniques like knowledge distillation, pruning, or quantization. Instead, we\ntake an incremental computing approach, looking to reuse calculations as the\ninputs change. However, the dense connectivity of conventional architectures\nposes a major obstacle to incremental computation, as even minor input changes\ncascade through the network and restrict information reuse. To address this, we\nuse vector quantization to discretize intermediate values in the network, which\nfilters out noisy and unnecessary modifications to hidden neurons, facilitating\nthe reuse of their values. We apply this approach to the transformers\narchitecture, creating an efficient incremental inference algorithm with\ncomplexity proportional to the fraction of the modified inputs. Our experiments\nwith adapting the OPT-125M pre-trained language model demonstrate comparable\naccuracy on document classification while requiring 12.1X (median) fewer\noperations for processing sequences of atomic edits.",

          "description": "Data profiling is an essential process in modern data-driven industries. One\nof its critical components is the discovery and validation of complex\nstatistics, including functional dependencies, data constraints, association\nrules, and others.\n\nHowever, most existing data profiling systems that focus on complex\nstatistics do not provide proper integration with the tools used by\ncontemporary data scientists. This creates a significant barrier to the\nadoption of these tools in the industry. Moreover, existing systems were not\ncreated with industrial-grade workloads in mind. Finally, they do not aim to\nprovide descriptive explanations, i.e. why a given pattern is not found. It is\na significant issue as it is essential to understand the underlying reasons for\na specific pattern's absence to make informed decisions based on the data.\n\nBecause of that, these patterns are effectively rest in thin air: their\napplication scope is rather limited, they are rarely used by the broader\npublic. At the same time, as we are going to demonstrate in this presentation,\ncomplex statistics can be efficiently used to solve many classic data quality\nproblems.\n\nDesbordante is an open-source data profiler that aims to close this gap. It\nis built with emphasis on industrial application: it is efficient, scalable,\nresilient to crashes, and provides explanations. Furthermore, it provides\nseamless Python integration by offloading various costly operations to the C++\ncore, not only mining.\n\nIn this demonstration, we show several scenarios that allow end users to\nsolve different data quality problems. Namely, we showcase typo detection, data\ndeduplication, and data anomaly detection scenarios.",

A total of 400 images (100 non-contrast controls, 100 contrast controls,\n100 non-contrast PKD, 100 contrast PKD) were utilized for training/validation\nof models to segment kidneys, livers, and spleens, and the final models were\nthen tested on 100 non-contrast CT images of patients affected by PKD.\nPerformance was evaluated using Dice, Jaccard, TPR, and Precision.\n\nResults: Models trained on a diverse range of data showed no worse\nperformance than models trained exclusively on in-domain data when tested on\nin-domain data. For instance, the Dice similarity of the model trained on 25%\nfrom each dataset was found to be non-inferior to the model trained purely on\nin-domain data.\n\nConclusions: The results indicate that broader training examples\nsignificantly enhances model generalization and out-of-domain performance,\nthereby improving automated segmentation tools' applicability in clinical\nsettings.

          "description": "Multi-Task Learning (MTL) aims to learn multiple tasks simultaneously while\nexploiting their mutual relationships. By using shared resources to\nsimultaneously calculate multiple outputs, this learning paradigm has the\npotential to have lower memory requirements and inference times compared to the\ntraditional approach of using separate methods for each task. Previous work in\nMTL has mainly focused on fully-supervised methods, as task relationships can\nnot only be leveraged to lower the level of data-dependency of those methods\nbut they can also improve performance. However, MTL introduces a set of\nchallenges due to a complex optimisation scheme and a higher labeling\nrequirement. This review focuses on how MTL could be utilised under different\npartial supervision settings to address these challenges. First, this review\nanalyses how MTL traditionally uses different parameter sharing techniques to\ntransfer knowledge in between tasks. Second, it presents the different\nchallenges arising from such a multi-objective optimisation scheme. Third, it\nintroduces how task groupings can be achieved by analysing task relationships.\nFourth, it focuses on how partially supervised methods applied to MTL can\ntackle the aforementioned challenges. Lastly, this review presents the\navailable datasets, tools and benchmarking results of such methods.",

This\nmachine learning subfield enables machine learning models to abstain from\nmaking a prediction when likely to make a mistake.\n\nThis survey aims to provide an overview on machine learning with rejection.\nWe introduce the conditions leading to two types of rejection, ambiguity and\nnovelty rejection, which we carefully formalize. Moreover, we review and\ncategorize strategies to evaluate a model's predictive and rejective quality.\nAdditionally, we define the existing architectures for models with rejection\nand describe the standard techniques for learning such models.

          "description": "The isomorphism problem is a fundamental problem in network analysis, which\ninvolves capturing both low-order and high-order structural information. In\nterms of extracting low-order structural information, graph isomorphism\nalgorithms analyze the structural equivalence to reduce the solver space\ndimension, which demonstrates its power in many applications, such as protein\ndesign, chemical pathways, and community detection. For the more commonly\noccurring high-order relationships in real-life scenarios, the problem of\nhypergraph isomorphism, which effectively captures these high-order structural\nrelationships, cannot be straightforwardly addressed using graph isomorphism\nmethods. Besides, the existing hypergraph kernel methods may suffer from high\nmemory consumption or inaccurate sub-structure identification, thus yielding\nsub-optimal performance. In this paper, to address the abovementioned problems,\nwe first propose the hypergraph Weisfiler-Lehman test algorithm for the\nhypergraph isomorphism test problem by generalizing the Weisfiler-Lehman test\nalgorithm from graphs to hypergraphs. Secondly, based on the presented\nalgorithm, we propose a general hypergraph Weisfieler-Lehman kernel framework\nand implement two instances, which are Hypergraph Weisfeiler-Lehamn Subtree\nKernel and Hypergraph Weisfeiler-Lehamn Hyperedge Kernel. In order to fulfill\nour research objectives, a comprehensive set of experiments was meticulously\ndesigned, including seven graph classification datasets and 12 hypergraph\nclassification datasets. Results on hypergraph classification datasets show\nsignificant improvements compared to other typical kernel-based methods, which\ndemonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed methods. In our evaluation, we\nfound that our proposed methods outperform the second-best method in terms of\nruntime, running over 80 times faster when handling complex hypergraph\nstructures.",

          "description": "Mobile edge computing (MEC) is essential for next-generation mobile network\napplications that prioritize various performance metrics, including delays and\nenergy consumption. However, conventional single-objective scheduling solutions\ncannot be directly applied to practical systems in which the preferences of\nthese applications (i.e., the weights of different objectives) are often\nunknown or challenging to specify in advance. In this study, we address this\nissue by formulating a multi-objective offloading problem for MEC with multiple\nedges to minimize expected long-term energy consumption and transmission delay\nwhile considering unknown preferences as parameters. To address the challenge\nof unknown preferences, we design a multi-objective (deep) reinforcement\nlearning (MORL)-based resource scheduling scheme with proximal policy\noptimization (PPO). In addition, we introduce a well-designed state encoding\nmethod for constructing features for multiple edges in MEC systems, a\nsophisticated reward function for accurately computing the utilities of delay\nand energy consumption.

          "description": "The wide application of deep neural networks (DNNs) demands an increasing\namount of attention to their real-world robustness, i.e., whether a DNN resists\nblack-box adversarial attacks, among which score-based query attacks (SQAs) are\nmost threatening since they can effectively hurt a victim network with the only\naccess to model outputs. Defending against SQAs requires a slight but artful\nvariation of outputs due to the service purpose for users, who share the same\noutput information with SQAs. In this paper, we propose a real-world defense by\nUnifying Gradients (UniG) of different data so that SQAs could only probe a\nmuch weaker attack direction that is similar for different samples. Since such\nuniversal attack perturbations have been validated as less aggressive than the\ninput-specific perturbations, UniG protects real-world DNNs by indicating\nattackers a twisted and less informative attack direction. We implement UniG\nefficiently by a Hadamard product module which is plug-and-play. According to\nextensive experiments on 5 SQAs, 2 adaptive attacks and 7 defense baselines,\nUniG significantly improves real-world robustness without hurting clean\naccuracy on CIFAR10 and ImageNet. For instance, UniG maintains a model of\n77.80% accuracy under 2500-query Square attack while the state-of-the-art\nadversarially-trained model only has 67.34% on CIFAR10. Simultaneously, UniG\noutperforms all compared baselines in terms of clean accuracy and achieves the\nsmallest modification of the model output.

Standard techniques to build these models\nuse features about people but overlook their actionability.

In this work, we introduce a formal testing\nprocedure to flag models that assign fixed predictions that we call recourse\nverification. We develop machinery to reliably determine if a given model can\nprovide recourse to its decision subjects from a set of user-specified\nactionability constraints. We demonstrate how our tools can ensure recourse and\nadversarial robustness in real-world datasets and use them to study the\ninfeasibility of recourse in real-world lending datasets.

          "description": "Deep learning-based surrogate models have been widely applied in geological\ncarbon storage (GCS) problems to accelerate the prediction of reservoir\npressure and CO2 plume migration. Large amounts of data from physics-based\nnumerical simulators are required to train a model to accurately predict the\ncomplex physical behaviors associated with this process. In practice, the\navailable training data are always limited in large-scale 3D problems due to\nthe high computational cost. Therefore, we propose to use a multi-fidelity\nFourier Neural Operator to solve large-scale GCS problems with more affordable\nmulti-fidelity training datasets. The Fourier Neural Operator has a desirable\ngrid-invariant property, which simplifies the transfer learning procedure\nbetween datasets with different discretization. We first test the model\nefficacy on a GCS reservoir model being discretized into 110k grid cells. The\nmulti-fidelity model can predict with accuracy comparable to a high-fidelity\nmodel trained with the same amount of high-fidelity data with 81% less data\ngeneration costs. We further test the generalizability of the multi-fidelity\nmodel on a same reservoir model with a finer discretization of 1 million grid\ncells. This case was made more challenging by employing high-fidelity and\nlow-fidelity datasets generated by different geostatistical models and\nreservoir simulators.

Here we present a single-shot MC\ndropout approximation that preserves the advantages of BNNs while being as fast\nas NNs. Our approach is based on moment propagation (MP) and allows to\nanalytically approximate the expected value and the variance of the MC dropout\nsignal for commonly used layers in NNs, i.e. convolution, max pooling, dense,\nsoftmax, and dropout layers. The MP approach can convert an NN into a BNN\nwithout re-training given the NN has been trained with standard dropout. We\nevaluate our approach on different benchmark datasets and a simulated toy\nexample in a classification and regression setting. We demonstrate that our\nsingle-shot MC dropout approximation resembles the point estimate and the\nuncertainty estimate of the predictive distribution that is achieved with an MC\napproach, while being fast enough for real-time deployments of BNNs. We show\nthat using part of the saved time to combine our MP approach with deep ensemble\ntechniques does further improve the uncertainty measures.",

          "description": "We characterize learnability for quantum measurement classes by establishing\nmatching necessary and sufficient conditions for their PAC learnability, along\nwith corresponding sample complexity bounds, in the setting where the learner\nis given access only to prepared quantum states. We first probe the results\nfrom previous works on this setting. We show that the empirical risk defined in\nprevious works and matching the definition in the classical theory fails to\nsatisfy the uniform convergence property enjoyed in the classical setting for\nsome learnable classes. Moreover, we show that VC dimension generalization\nupper bounds in previous work are frequently infinite, even for\nfinite-dimensional POVM classes. To surmount the failure of the standard ERM to\nsatisfy uniform convergence, we define a new learning rule -- denoised ERM. We\nshow this to be a universal learning rule for POVM and probabilistically\nobserved concept classes, and the condition for it to satisfy uniform\nconvergence is finite fat shattering dimension of the class. We give\nquantitative sample complexity upper and lower bounds for learnability in terms\nof finite fat-shattering dimension and a notion of approximate finite\npartitionability into approximately jointly measurable subsets, which allow for\nsample reuse. We then show that finite fat shattering dimension implies finite\ncoverability by approximately jointly measurable subsets, leading to our\nmatching conditions.

          "description": "Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) is increasingly applied in large-scale\nproductions like Netflix and Facebook. As with most data-driven systems, DRL\nsystems can exhibit undesirable behaviors due to environmental drifts, which\noften occur in constantly-changing production settings. Continual Learning (CL)\nis the inherent self-healing approach for adapting the DRL agent in response to\nthe environment's conditions shifts. However, successive shifts of considerable\nmagnitude may cause the production environment to drift from its original\nstate. Recent studies have shown that these environmental drifts tend to drive\nCL into long, or even unsuccessful, healing cycles, which arise from\ninefficiencies such as catastrophic forgetting, warm-starting failure, and slow\nconvergence. In this paper, we propose Dr. DRL, an effective self-healing\napproach for DRL systems that integrates a novel mechanism of intentional\nforgetting into vanilla CL to overcome its main issues. Dr. DRL deliberately\nerases the DRL system's minor behaviors to systematically prioritize the\nadaptation of the key problem-solving skills. Using well-established DRL\nalgorithms, Dr. DRL is compared with vanilla CL on various drifted\nenvironments. Dr. DRL is able to reduce, on average, the healing time and\nfine-tuning episodes by, respectively, 18.74% and 17.72%. Dr. DRL successfully\nhelps agents to adapt to 19.63% of drifted environments left unsolved by\nvanilla CL while maintaining and even enhancing by up to 45% the obtained\nrewards for drifted environments that are resolved by both approaches.",

          "description": "Common explanations for shortcut learning assume that the shortcut improves\nprediction under the training distribution but not in the test distribution.\nThus, models trained via the typical gradient-based optimization of\ncross-entropy, which we call default-ERM, utilize the shortcut. However, even\nwhen the stable feature determines the label in the training distribution and\nthe shortcut does not provide any additional information, like in perception\ntasks, default-ERM still exhibits shortcut learning. Why are such solutions\npreferred when the loss for default-ERM can be driven to zero using the stable\nfeature alone? By studying a linear perception task, we show that default-ERM's\npreference for maximizing the margin leads to models that depend more on the\nshortcut than the stable feature, even without overparameterization. This\ninsight suggests that default-ERM's implicit inductive bias towards max-margin\nis unsuitable for perception tasks. Instead, we develop an inductive bias\ntoward uniform margins and show that this bias guarantees dependence only on\nthe perfect stable feature in the linear perception task. We develop loss\nfunctions that encourage uniform-margin solutions, called margin control\n(MARG-CTRL). MARG-CTRL mitigates shortcut learning on a variety of vision and\nlanguage tasks, showing that better inductive biases can remove the need for\nexpensive two-stage shortcut-mitigating methods in perception tasks.",

          "description": "Variational Information Pursuit (V-IP) is a framework for making\ninterpretable predictions by design by sequentially selecting a short chain of\ntask-relevant, user-defined and interpretable queries about the data that are\nmost informative for the task. While this allows for built-in interpretability\nin predictive models, applying V-IP to any task requires data samples with\ndense concept-labeling by domain experts, limiting the application of V-IP to\nsmall-scale tasks where manual data annotation is feasible. In this work, we\nextend the V-IP framework with Foundational Models (FMs) to address this\nlimitation. More specifically, we use a two-step process, by first leveraging\nLarge Language Models (LLMs) to generate a sufficiently large candidate set of\ntask-relevant interpretable concepts, then using Large Multimodal Models to\nannotate each data sample by semantic similarity with each concept in the\ngenerated concept set. While other interpretable-by-design frameworks such as\nConcept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) require an additional step of removing\nrepetitive and non-discriminative concepts to have good interpretability and\ntest performance, we mathematically and empirically justify that, with a\nsufficiently informative and task-relevant query (concept) set, the proposed\nFM+V-IP method does not require any type of concept filtering. In addition, we\nshow that FM+V-IP with LLM generated concepts can achieve better test\nperformance than V-IP with human annotated concepts, demonstrating the\neffectiveness of LLMs at generating efficient query sets. Finally, when\ncompared to other interpretable-by-design frameworks such as CBMs, FM+V-IP can\nachieve competitive test performance using fewer number of concepts/queries in\nboth cases with filtered or unfiltered concept sets.",

Specifically, to efficiently explore the combinatorial and\nconstrained action space, we introduce six slave models with distinguished\nmerits to generate diversified samples well balancing rewards and constraints\nas well as efficiency. Moreover, we propose teacher learning based optimization\nand the policy co-training technique to boost the performance of the multiple\nslave models. The master model then collects the elite samples provided by the\nslave models and selects the best sample estimated by a neural contextual\nUCB-based network to make a decision with a trade-off between exploration and\nexploitation. Thanks to the elaborate design of slave models, the co-training\nmechanism among slave models, and the novel interactions between the master and\nslave models, our approach significantly surpasses existing state-of-the-art\nalgorithms in both synthetic and real datasets for recommendation tasks.

          "description": "Multiple-try Metropolis (MTM) is a popular Markov chain Monte Carlo method\nwith the appealing feature of being amenable to parallel computing. At each\niteration, it samples several candidates for the next state of the Markov chain\nand randomly selects one of them based on a weight function. The canonical\nweight function is proportional to the target density. We show both\ntheoretically and empirically that this weight function induces pathological\nbehaviours in high dimensions, especially during the convergence phase. We\npropose to instead use weight functions akin to the locally-balanced proposal\ndistributions of Zanella (2020), thus yielding MTM algorithms that do not\nexhibit those pathological behaviours. To theoretically analyse these\nalgorithms, we study the high-dimensional performance of ideal schemes that can\nbe thought of as MTM algorithms which sample an infinite number of candidates\nat each iteration, as well as the discrepancy between such schemes and the MTM\nalgorithms which sample a finite number of candidates. Our analysis unveils a\nstrong distinction between the convergence and stationary phases: in the\nformer, local balancing is crucial and effective to achieve fast convergence,\nwhile in the latter, the canonical and novel weight functions yield similar\nperformance. Numerical experiments include an application in precision medicine\ninvolving a computationally-expensive forward model, which makes the use of\nparallel computing within MTM iterations beneficial.",

          "description": "Low-count time series describe sparse or intermittent events, which are\nprevalent in large-scale online platforms that capture and monitor diverse data\ntypes. Several distinct challenges surface when modelling low-count time\nseries, particularly low signal-to-noise ratios (when anomaly signatures are\nprovably undetectable), and non-uniform performance (when average metrics are\nnot representative of local behaviour). The time series anomaly detection\ncommunity currently lacks explicit tooling and processes to model and reliably\ndetect anomalies in these settings. We address this gap by introducing a novel\ngenerative procedure for creating benchmark datasets comprising of low-count\ntime series with anomalous segments. Via a mixture of theoretical and empirical\nanalysis, our work explains how widely-used algorithms struggle with the\ndistribution overlap between normal and anomalous segments. In order to\nmitigate this shortcoming, we then leverage our findings to demonstrate how\nanomaly score smoothing consistently improves performance.

          "description": "Early sensory systems in the brain rapidly adapt to fluctuating input\nstatistics, which requires recurrent communication between neurons.\nMechanistically, such recurrent communication is often indirect and mediated by\nlocal interneurons. In this work, we explore the computational benefits of\nmediating recurrent communication via interneurons compared with direct\nrecurrent connections. To this end, we consider two mathematically tractable\nrecurrent linear neural networks that statistically whiten their inputs -- one\nwith direct recurrent connections and the other with interneurons that mediate\nrecurrent communication. By analyzing the corresponding continuous synaptic\ndynamics and numerically simulating the networks, we show that the network with\ninterneurons is more robust to initialization than the network with direct\nrecurrent connections in the sense that the convergence time for the synaptic\ndynamics in the network with interneurons (resp. direct recurrent connections)\nscales logarithmically (resp. linearly) with the spectrum of their\ninitialization. Our results suggest that interneurons are computationally\nuseful for rapid adaptation to changing input statistics. Interestingly, the\nnetwork with interneurons is an overparameterized solution of the whitening\nobjective for the network with direct recurrent connections, so our results can\nbe viewed as a recurrent linear neural network analogue of the implicit\nacceleration phenomenon observed in overparameterized feedforward linear neural\nnetworks.",

          "description": "Sparsity is a highly desired feature in deep neural networks (DNNs) since it\nensures numerical efficiency, improves the interpretability of models (due to\nthe smaller number of relevant features), and robustness. In machine learning\napproaches based on linear models, it is well known that there exists a\nconnecting path between the sparsest solution in terms of the $\\ell^1$ norm\n(i.e., zero weights) and the non-regularized solution, which is called the\nregularization path. Very recently, there was a first attempt to extend the\nconcept of regularization paths to DNNs by means of treating the empirical loss\nand sparsity ($\\ell^1$ norm) as two conflicting criteria and solving the\nresulting multiobjective optimization problem. However, due to the\nnon-smoothness of the $\\ell^1$ norm and the high number of parameters, this\napproach is not very efficient from a computational perspective. To overcome\nthis limitation, we present an algorithm that allows for the approximation of\nthe entire Pareto front for the above-mentioned objectives in a very efficient\nmanner. We present numerical examples using both deterministic and stochastic\ngradients.

Experimental results demonstrate an impressive overall\nclassification accuracy of 95%, with straight roads achieving a remarkable 97%\nF1 score and intersections reaching a 90% F1 score. This approach not only\nsaves time and resources but also enables more frequent updates and a\ncomprehensive understanding of the road network. Our research showcases the\npotential impact on traffic management, urban planning, and autonomous vehicle\nnavigation systems.

The increasing complexity of channel modelling and the cost of\ncollecting high-quality wireless channel data have become major challenges. In\nthis paper, we propose a diffusion model based channel sampling approach for\nrapidly synthesizing channel realizations from limited data. We use a diffusion\nmodel with a U Net based architecture operating in the frequency space domain.\nTo evaluate how well the proposed model reproduces the true distribution of\nchannels in the training dataset, two evaluation metrics are used: $i)$ the\napproximate $2$-Wasserstein distance between real and generated distributions\nof the normalized power spectrum in the antenna and frequency domains and $ii)$\nprecision and recall metric for distributions. We show that, compared to\nexisting GAN based approaches which suffer from mode collapse and unstable\ntraining, our diffusion based approach trains stably and generates diverse and\nhigh-fidelity samples from the true channel distribution. We also show that we\ncan pretrain the model on a simulated urban macro-cellular channel dataset and\nfine-tune it on a smaller, out-of-distribution urban micro-cellular dataset,\ntherefore showing that it is feasible to model real world channels using\nlimited data with this approach.",

          "description": "Counter-adversarial system design problems have lately motivated the\ndevelopment of inverse Bayesian filters. For example, inverse Kalman filter\n(I-KF) has been recently formulated to estimate the adversary's\nKalman-filter-tracked estimates and hence, predict the adversary's future\nsteps. The purpose of this paper and the companion paper (Part I) is to address\nthe inverse filtering problem in non-linear systems by proposing an inverse\nextended Kalman filter (I-EKF). The companion paper proposed the theory of\nI-EKF (with and without unknown inputs) and I-KF (with unknown inputs). In this\npaper, we develop this theory for highly non-linear models, which employ\nsecond-order, Gaussian sum, and dithered forward EKFs. In particular, we derive\ntheoretical stability guarantees for the inverse second-order EKF using the\nbounded non-linearity approach. To address the limitation of the standard\nI-EKFs that the system model and forward filter are perfectly known to the\ndefender, we propose reproducing kernel Hilbert space-based EKF to learn the\nunknown system dynamics based on its observations, which can be employed as an\ninverse filter to infer the adversary's estimate.

          "description": "Here, we show that the InfoNCE objective is equivalent to the ELBO in a new\nclass of probabilistic generative model, the recognition parameterised model\n(RPM). When we learn the optimal prior, the RPM ELBO becomes equal to the\nmutual information (MI; up to a constant), establishing a connection to\npre-existing self-supervised learning methods such as InfoNCE. However,\npractical InfoNCE methods do not use the MI as an objective; the MI is\ninvariant to arbitrary invertible transformations, so using an MI objective can\nlead to highly entangled representations (Tschannen et al., 2019). Instead, the\nactual InfoNCE objective is a simplified lower bound on the MI which is loose\neven in the infinite sample limit. Thus, an objective that works (i.e. the\nactual InfoNCE objective) appears to be motivated as a loose bound on an\nobjective that does not work (i.e. the true MI which gives arbitrarily\nentangled representations). We give an alternative motivation for the actual\nInfoNCE objective. In particular, we show that in the infinite sample limit,\nand for a particular choice of prior, the actual InfoNCE objective is equal to\nthe ELBO (up to a constant); and the ELBO is equal to the marginal likelihood\nwith a deterministic recognition model. Thus, we argue that our VAE perspective\ngives a better motivation for InfoNCE than MI, as the actual InfoNCE objective\nis only loosely bounded by the MI, but is equal to the ELBO/marginal likelihood\n(up to a constant).",

          "description": "Multi-task learning is frequently used to model a set of related response\nvariables from the same set of features, improving predictive performance and\nmodeling accuracy relative to methods that handle each response variable\nseparately. Despite the potential of multi-task learning to yield more powerful\ninference than single-task alternatives, prior work in this area has largely\nomitted uncertainty quantification. Our focus in this paper is a common\nmulti-task problem in neuroimaging, where the goal is to understand the\nrelationship between multiple cognitive task scores (or other subject-level\nassessments) and brain connectome data collected from imaging. We propose a\nframework for selective inference to address this problem, with the flexibility\nto: (i) jointly identify the relevant covariates for each task through a\nsparsity-inducing penalty, and (ii) conduct valid inference in a model based on\nthe estimated sparsity structure. Our framework offers a new conditional\nprocedure for inference, based on a refinement of the selection event that\nyields a tractable selection-adjusted likelihood. This gives an approximate\nsystem of estimating equations for maximum likelihood inference, solvable via a\nsingle convex optimization problem, and enables us to efficiently form\nconfidence intervals with approximately the correct coverage. Applied to both\nsimulated data and data from the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD)\nstudy, our selective inference methods yield tighter confidence intervals than\ncommonly used alternatives, such as data splitting. We also demonstrate through\nsimulations that multi-task learning with selective inference can more\naccurately recover true signals than single-task methods.",

Possible\nidentifiability of SCMs given data depends on assumptions made on the noise\nvariables and the functional classes in the SCM. For instance, in the LiNGAM\nmodel, the functional class is restricted to linear functions and the\ndisturbances have to be non-Gaussian.\n\nIn this work, we propose TSLiNGAM, a new method for identifying the DAG of a\ncausal model based on observational data.

TSLiNGAM leverages the non-Gaussianity assumption\nof the error terms in the LiNGAM model to obtain more efficient and robust\nestimation of the causal structure. TSLiNGAM is justified theoretically and is\nstudied empirically in an extensive simulation study.

          "description": "Neural network approaches to approximate the ground state of quantum\nhamiltonians require the numerical solution of a highly nonlinear optimization\nproblem. We introduce a statistical learning approach that makes the\noptimization trivial by using kernel methods. Our scheme is an approximate\nrealization of the power method, where supervised learning is used to learn the\nnext step of the power iteration. We show that the ground state properties of\narbitrary gapped quantum hamiltonians can be reached with polynomial resources\nunder the assumption that the supervised learning is efficient. Using kernel\nridge regression, we provide numerical evidence that the learning assumption is\nverified by applying our scheme to find the ground states of several\nprototypical interacting many-body quantum systems, both in one and two\ndimensions, showing the flexibility of our approach.",

          "description": "Modern transportation planning relies heavily on accurate predictions of\nperson and vehicle trips. However, traditional planning models often fail to\naccount for the intricacies and dynamics of travel behavior, leading to\nless-than-optimal accuracy in these predictions. This study explores the\npotential of deep learning techniques to transform the way we approach trip\npredictions, and ultimately, transportation planning. Utilizing a comprehensive\ndataset from the National Household Travel Survey (NHTS), we developed and\ntrained a deep learning model for predicting person and vehicle trips. The\nproposed model leverages the vast amount of information in the NHTS data,\ncapturing complex, non-linear relationships that were previously overlooked by\ntraditional models. As a result, our deep learning model achieved an impressive\naccuracy of 98% for person trip prediction and 96% for vehicle trip estimation.\nThis represents a significant improvement over the performances of traditional\ntransportation planning models, thereby demonstrating the power of deep\nlearning in this domain. The implications of this study extend beyond just more\naccurate predictions. By enhancing the accuracy and reliability of trip\nprediction models, planners can formulate more effective, data-driven\ntransportation policies, infrastructure, and services. As such, our research\nunderscores the need for the transportation planning field to embrace advanced\ntechniques like deep learning. The detailed methodology, along with a thorough\ndiscussion of the results and their implications, are presented in the\nsubsequent sections of this paper.",

          "description": "We present novel cross-sectional and longitudinal claim count models for\nvehicle insurance built upon the Combined Actuarial Neural Network (CANN)\nframework proposed by Mario W\\\"uthrich and Michael Merz. The CANN approach\ncombines a classical actuarial model, such as a generalized linear model, with\na neural network. This blending of models results in a two-component model\ncomprising a classical regression model and a neural network part. The CANN\nmodel leverages the strengths of both components, providing a solid foundation\nand interpretability from the classical model while harnessing the flexibility\nand capacity to capture intricate relationships and interactions offered by the\nneural network. In our proposed models, we use well-known log-linear claim\ncount regression models for the classical regression part and a multilayer\nperceptron (MLP) for the neural network part. The MLP part is used to process\ntelematics car driving data given as a vector characterizing the driving\nbehavior of each insured driver. In addition to the Poisson and negative\nbinomial distributions for cross-sectional data, we propose a procedure for\ntraining our CANN model with a multivariate negative binomial (MVNB)\nspecification. By doing so, we introduce a longitudinal model that accounts for\nthe dependence between contracts from the same insured.

Despite\ntheir wide usage, existing methods suffer from several fundamental limitations.\nIn particular, we lack a rigorous statistical test for whether two\nhigh-dimensional single-cell datasets are alignable (and therefore should even\nbe aligned). Moreover, popular methods can substantially distort the data\nduring alignment, making the aligned data and downstream analysis difficult to\ninterpret. To overcome these limitations, we present a spectral manifold\nalignment and inference (SMAI) framework, which enables principled and\ninterpretable alignability testing and structure-preserving integration of\nsingle-cell data. SMAI provides a statistical test to robustly determine the\nalignability between datasets to avoid misleading inference, and is justified\nby high-dimensional statistical theory. On a diverse range of real and\nsimulated benchmark datasets, it outperforms commonly used alignment methods.\nMoreover, we show that SMAI improves various downstream analyses such as\nidentification of differentially expressed genes and imputation of single-cell\nspatial transcriptomics, providing further biological insights.

          "description": "This paper focusses on the optimal implementation of a Mean Variance\nEstimation network (MVE network) (Nix and Weigend, 1994). This type of network\nis often used as a building block for uncertainty estimation methods in a\nregression setting, for instance Concrete dropout (Gal et al., 2017) and Deep\nEnsembles (Lakshminarayanan et al., 2017). Specifically, an MVE network assumes\nthat the data is produced from a normal distribution with a mean function and\nvariance function. The MVE network outputs a mean and variance estimate and\noptimizes the network parameters by minimizing the negative loglikelihood. In\nour paper, we present two significant insights. Firstly, the convergence\ndifficulties reported in recent work can be relatively easily prevented by\nfollowing the simple yet often overlooked recommendation from the original\nauthors that a warm-up period should be used. During this period, only the mean\nis optimized with a fixed variance. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this\nstep through experimentation, highlighting that it should be standard practice.\nAs a sidenote, we examine whether, after the warm-up, it is beneficial to fix\nthe mean while optimizing the variance or to optimize both simultaneously.\nHere, we do not observe a substantial difference. Secondly, we introduce a\nnovel improvement of the MVE network: separate regularization of the mean and\nthe variance estimate. We demonstrate, both on toy examples and on a number of\nbenchmark UCI regression data sets, that following the original recommendations\nand the novel separate regularization can lead to significant improvements.",

A modification of the original $Q$ learning method\nwas proposed in (Shah and Xie, 2018), which estimates $Q$ values with nearest\nneighbors. Such modification makes $Q$ learning suitable for continuous state\nspace. (Shah and Xie, 2018) shows that the convergence rate of estimated $Q$\nfunction is $\\tilde{O}(T^{-1/(d+3)})$, which is slower than the minimax lower\nbound $\\tilde{\\Omega}(T^{-1/(d+2)})$, indicating that this method is not\nefficient.

Despite that we still use nearest neighbor approach\nto estimate $Q$ function, the algorithms are crucially different from (Shah and\nXie, 2018).

          "description": "Recent studies have shown that deep neural networks (DNNs) are vulnerable to\nadversarial attacks, including evasion and backdoor (poisoning) attacks. On the\ndefense side, there have been intensive efforts on improving both empirical and\nprovable robustness against evasion attacks; however, the provable robustness\nagainst backdoor attacks still remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we\nfocus on certifying the machine learning model robustness against general\nthreat models, especially backdoor attacks. We first provide a unified\nframework via randomized smoothing techniques and show how it can be\ninstantiated to certify the robustness against both evasion and backdoor\nattacks. We then propose the first robust training process, RAB, to smooth the\ntrained model and certify its robustness against backdoor attacks. We prove the\nrobustness bound for machine learning models trained with RAB and prove that\nour robustness bound is tight. In addition, we theoretically show that it is\npossible to train the robust smoothed models efficiently for simple models such\nas K-nearest neighbor classifiers, and we propose an exact smooth-training\nalgorithm that eliminates the need to sample from a noise distribution for such\nmodels. Empirically, we conduct comprehensive experiments for different machine\nlearning (ML) models such as DNNs, support vector machines, and K-NN models on\nMNIST, CIFAR-10, and ImageNette datasets and provide the first benchmark for\ncertified robustness against backdoor attacks. In addition, we evaluate K-NN\nmodels on a spambase tabular dataset to demonstrate the advantages of the\nproposed exact algorithm.

          "description": "As neural networks become more popular, the need for accompanying uncertainty\nestimates increases. There are currently two main approaches to test the\nquality of these estimates. Most methods output a density. They can be compared\nby evaluating their loglikelihood on a test set. Other methods output a\nprediction interval directly. These methods are often tested by examining the\nfraction of test points that fall inside the corresponding prediction\nintervals. Intuitively both approaches seem logical. However, we demonstrate\nthrough both theoretical arguments and simulations that both ways of evaluating\nthe quality of uncertainty estimates have serious flaws. Firstly, both\napproaches cannot disentangle the separate components that jointly create the\npredictive uncertainty, making it difficult to evaluate the quality of the\nestimates of these components. Secondly, a better loglikelihood does not\nguarantee better prediction intervals, which is what the methods are often used\nfor in practice. Moreover, the current approach to test prediction intervals\ndirectly has additional flaws. We show why it is fundamentally flawed to test a\nprediction or confidence interval on a single test set. At best, marginal\ncoverage is measured, implicitly averaging out overconfident and underconfident\npredictions. A much more desirable property is pointwise coverage, requiring\nthe correct coverage for each prediction. We demonstrate through practical\nexamples that these effects can result in favoring a method, based on the\npredictive uncertainty, that has undesirable behaviour of the confidence or\nprediction intervals. Finally, we propose a simulation-based testing approach\nthat addresses these problems while still allowing easy comparison between\ndifferent methods.",

To do so, we focus on the case of least-squares regression\n(LSR) and analyze a general stochastic approximation algorithm for minimizing\nquadratic functions relying on a random field. We consider weak assumptions on\nthe random field, tailored to the analysis (specifically, expected H\\\"older\nregularity), and on the noise covariance, enabling the analysis of various\nrandomizing mechanisms, including compression. We then extend our results to\nthe case of federated learning.\n\nMore formally, we highlight the impact on the convergence of the covariance\n$\\mathfrak{C}_{\\mathrm{ania}}$ of the additive noise induced by the algorithm.\nWe demonstrate despite the non-regularity of the stochastic field, that the\nlimit variance term scales with $\\mathrm{Tr}(\\mathfrak{C}_{\\mathrm{ania}}\nH^{-1})/K$ (where $H$ is the Hessian of the optimization problem and $K$ the\nnumber of iterations) generalizing the rate for the vanilla LSR case where it\nis $\\sigma^2 \\mathrm{Tr}(H H^{-1}) / K = \\sigma^2 d / K$ (Bach and Moulines,\n2013).

One\nsuch notion is individual fairness (IF), which requires that individuals who\nare similar receive similar treatment. In parallel, matrix estimation (ME) has\nemerged as a natural paradigm for handling noisy data with missing values. In\nthis work, we connect the two concepts. We show that pre-processing data using\nME can improve an algorithm's IF without sacrificing performance. Specifically,\nwe show that using a popular ME method known as singular value thresholding\n(SVT) to pre-process the data provides a strong IF guarantee under appropriate\nconditions. We then show that, under analogous conditions, SVT pre-processing\nalso yields estimates that are consistent and approximately minimax optimal. As\nsuch, the ME pre-processing step does not, under the stated conditions,\nincrease the prediction error of the base algorithm, i.e., does not impose a\nfairness-performance trade-off.

          "description": "We consider convex relaxations for recovering low-rank tensors based on\nconstrained minimization over a ball induced by the tensor nuclear norm,\nrecently introduced in \\cite{tensor_tSVD}. We build on a recent line of results\nthat considered convex relaxations for the recovery of low-rank matrices and\nestablished that under a strict complementarity condition (SC), both the\nconvergence rate and per-iteration runtime of standard gradient methods may\nimprove dramatically. We develop the appropriate strict complementarity\ncondition for the tensor nuclear norm ball and obtain the following main\nresults under this condition: 1. When the objective to minimize is of the form\n$f(\\mX)=g(\\mA\\mX)+\\langle{\\mC,\\mX}\\rangle$ , where $g$ is strongly convex and\n$\\mA$ is a linear map (e.g., least squares), a quadratic growth bound holds,\nwhich implies linear convergence rates for standard projected gradient methods,\ndespite the fact that $f$ need not be strongly convex. 2. For a smooth\nobjective function, when initialized in certain proximity of an optimal\nsolution which satisfies SC, standard projected gradient methods only require\nSVD computations (for projecting onto the tensor nuclear norm ball) of rank\nthat matches the tubal rank of the optimal solution. In particular, when the\ntubal rank is constant, this implies nearly linear (in the size of the tensor)\nruntime per iteration, as opposed to super linear without further assumptions.\n3. For a nonsmooth objective function which admits a popular smooth\nsaddle-point formulation, we derive similar results to the latter for the well\nknown extragradient method. An additional contribution which may be of\nindependent interest, is the rigorous extension of many basic results regarding\ntensors of arbitrary order, which were previously obtained only for third-order\ntensors.",

          "description": "Algorithms for solving the linear classification problem have a long history,\ndating back at least to 1936 with linear discriminant analysis. For linearly\nseparable data, many algorithms can obtain the exact solution to the\ncorresponding 0-1 loss classification problem efficiently, but for data which\nis not linearly separable, it has been shown that this problem, in full\ngenerality, is NP-hard. Alternative approaches all involve approximations of\nsome kind, including the use of surrogates for the 0-1 loss (for example, the\nhinge or logistic loss) or approximate combinatorial search, none of which can\nbe guaranteed to solve the problem exactly. Finding efficient algorithms to\nobtain an exact i.e. globally optimal solution for the 0-1 loss linear\nclassification problem with fixed dimension, remains an open problem. In\nresearch we report here, we detail the rigorous construction of a new\nalgorithm, incremental cell enumeration (ICE), that can solve the 0-1 loss\nclassification problem exactly in polynomial time. We prove correctness using\nconcepts from the theory of hyperplane arrangements and oriented matroids. We\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of this algorithm on synthetic and real-world\ndatasets, showing optimal accuracy both in and out-of-sample, in practical\ncomputational time.

          "description": "With the rise of the popularity and usage of neural networks, trustworthy\nuncertainty estimation is becoming increasingly essential. One of the most\nprominent uncertainty estimation methods is Deep Ensembles (Lakshminarayanan et\nal., 2017) . A classical parametric model has uncertainty in the parameters due\nto the fact that the data on which the model is build is a random sample. A\nmodern neural network has an additional uncertainty component since the\noptimization of the network is random. Lakshminarayanan et al. (2017) noted\nthat Deep Ensembles do not incorporate the classical uncertainty induced by the\neffect of finite data. In this paper, we present a computationally cheap\nextension of Deep Ensembles for the regression setting, called Bootstrapped\nDeep Ensembles, that explicitly takes this classical effect of finite data into\naccount using a modified version of the parametric bootstrap. We demonstrate\nthrough an experimental study that our method significantly improves upon\nstandard Deep Ensembles",

          "description": "Deep-learning models for traffic data prediction can have superior\nperformance in modeling complex functions using a multi-layer architecture.\nHowever, a major drawback of these approaches is that most of these approaches\ndo not offer forecasts with uncertainty estimates, which are essential for\ntraffic operations and control. Without uncertainty estimates, it is difficult\nto place any level of trust to the model predictions, and operational\nstrategies relying on overconfident predictions can lead to worsening traffic\nconditions. In this study, we propose a Bayesian recurrent neural network\nframework for uncertainty quantification in traffic prediction with higher\ngeneralizability by introducing spectral normalization to its hidden layers. In\nour paper, we have shown that normalization alters the training process of deep\nneural networks by controlling the model's complexity and reducing the risk of\noverfitting to the training data. This, in turn, helps improve the\ngeneralization performance of the model on out-of-distribution datasets.\nResults demonstrate that spectral normalization improves uncertainty estimates\nand significantly outperforms both the layer normalization and model without\nnormalization in single-step prediction horizons. This improved performance can\nbe attributed to the ability of spectral normalization to better localize the\nfeature space of the data under perturbations. Our findings are especially\nrelevant to traffic management applications, where predicting traffic\nconditions across multiple locations is the goal, but the availability of\ntraining data from multiple locations is limited. Spectral normalization,\ntherefore, provides a more generalizable approach that can effectively capture\nthe underlying patterns in traffic data without requiring location-specific\nmodels.",

          "description": "Algorithmic Gaussianization is a phenomenon that can arise when using\nrandomized sketching or sampling methods to produce smaller representations of\nlarge datasets: For certain tasks, these sketched representations have been\nobserved to exhibit many robust performance characteristics that are known to\noccur when a data sample comes from a sub-gaussian random design, which is a\npowerful statistical model of data distributions. However, this phenomenon has\nonly been studied for specific tasks and metrics, or by relying on\ncomputationally expensive methods. We address this by providing an algorithmic\nframework for gaussianizing data distributions via averaging, proving that it\nis possible to efficiently construct data sketches that are nearly\nindistinguishable (in terms of total variation distance) from sub-gaussian\nrandom designs. In particular, relying on a recently introduced sketching\ntechnique called Leverage Score Sparsified (LESS) embeddings, we show that one\ncan construct an $n\\times d$ sketch of an $N\\times d$ matrix $A$, where $n\\ll\nN$, that is nearly indistinguishable from a sub-gaussian design, in time\n$O(\\text{nnz}(A)\\log N + nd^2)$, where $\\text{nnz}(A)$ is the number of\nnon-zero entries in $A$. As a consequence, strong statistical guarantees and\nprecise asymptotics available for the estimators produced from sub-gaussian\ndesigns (e.g., for least squares and Lasso regression, covariance estimation,\nlow-rank approximation, etc.) can be straightforwardly adapted to our sketching\nframework. We illustrate this with a new approximation guarantee for sketched\nleast squares, among other examples.",

Unfortunately, these existing causal\nmethods are not designed for path-dependent link formation, as the cascading\nfunctional dependencies between links (arising from path dependence) are either\nunidentifiable or require an impractical number of control variables. To\novercome this, we develop the first causal model capable of dealing with path\ndependencies in link prediction.

It is therefore natural to wonder whether they are optimally trained.\nHere we apply a recent advancement in stochastic thermodynamics which allows\nbounding the speed at which one can go from the initial weight distribution to\nthe final distribution of the fully trained network, based on the ratio of\ntheir Wasserstein-2 distance and the entropy production rate of the dynamical\nprocess connecting them. Considering both gradient-flow and Langevin training\ndynamics, we provide analytical expressions for these speed limits for linear\nand linearizable neural networks e.g. Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK). Remarkably,\ngiven some plausible scaling assumptions on the NTK spectra and spectral\ndecomposition of the labels -- learning is optimal in a scaling sense. Our\nresults are consistent with small-scale experiments with Convolutional Neural\nNetworks (CNNs) and Fully Connected Neural networks (FCNs) on CIFAR-10, showing\na short highly non-optimal regime followed by a longer optimal regime.",

Then, we propose to modify\nthe output of an NN via the objective function and introduce different\nobjective functions for network training.

          "description": "Preserving training dynamics across batch sizes is an important tool for\npractical machine learning as it enables the trade-off between batch size and\nwall-clock time. This trade-off is typically enabled by a scaling rule, for\nexample, in stochastic gradient descent, one should scale the learning rate\nlinearly with the batch size. Another important tool for practical machine\nlearning is the model Exponential Moving Average (EMA), which is a model copy\nthat does not receive gradient information, but instead follows its target\nmodel with some momentum. This model EMA can improve the robustness and\ngeneralization properties of supervised learning, stabilize pseudo-labeling,\nand provide a learning signal for Self-Supervised Learning (SSL). Prior works\nhave treated the model EMA separately from optimization, leading to different\ntraining dynamics across batch sizes and lower model performance. In this work,\nwe provide a scaling rule for optimization in the presence of model EMAs and\ndemonstrate its validity across a range of architectures, optimizers, and data\nmodalities. We also show the rule's validity where the model EMA contributes to\nthe optimization of the target model, enabling us to train EMA-based\npseudo-labeling and SSL methods at small and large batch sizes.

In this work, we consider Mixed-Membership Stochastic\nBlock Model (MMSB) first proposed by Airoldi et al. (2008). MMSB provides quite\na general setting for modeling overlapping community structure in graphs. The\ncentral question of this paper is to reconstruct relations between communities\ngiven an observed network.

          "description": "Deep learning often faces the challenge of efficiently processing dynamic\ninputs, such as sensor data or user inputs. For example, an AI writing\nassistant is required to update its suggestions in real time as a document is\nedited. Re-running the model each time is expensive, even with compression\ntechniques like knowledge distillation, pruning, or quantization. Instead, we\ntake an incremental computing approach, looking to reuse calculations as the\ninputs change. However, the dense connectivity of conventional architectures\nposes a major obstacle to incremental computation, as even minor input changes\ncascade through the network and restrict information reuse. To address this, we\nuse vector quantization to discretize intermediate values in the network, which\nfilters out noisy and unnecessary modifications to hidden neurons, facilitating\nthe reuse of their values. We apply this approach to the transformers\narchitecture, creating an efficient incremental inference algorithm with\ncomplexity proportional to the fraction of the modified inputs. Our experiments\nwith adapting the OPT-125M pre-trained language model demonstrate comparable\naccuracy on document classification while requiring 12.1X (median) fewer\noperations for processing sequences of atomic edits.",

          "description": "I have been captivated by Recursive Least Squares (RLS) methods, particularly the approach that employs error prediction instead of matrix inversion. This method is quite intuitive. Let's consider a scenario where you need to estimate the true effect of four factors (color, gender, age, and weight) on blood sugar. To find the true impact of weight on blood sugar, it's necessary to eliminate the influence of every other factor on weight. This can be accomplished by using simple least squares regression to predict the residual errors recursively, as shown in the diagram below:\n Removing the effect of all factors on \\\"weight\\\" in a recursive manner\n The fundamental contrast between RLS and Gradient-based methods lies in how errors are distributed across inputs based on their activity, leading to the subsequent update of weights. However, in the case of RLS, all inputs undergo decorrelation before evaluating prediction errors. \n Comparison between error sharing in RLS and GD\n This de-correlation can be done in few lines of python code:\n for i in range(number_of_factors):\n for j in range(i+1, number_of_factors): \n wx = np.sum(x[i] * x[j]) / np.sum(x[i]**2) \n x[j] -= wx * x[i] \n This approach also bears relevance to predictive coding and can shed light on intriguing neuroscientific findings, such as the increase brain activity during surprising or novel events — attributable to prediction errors.\n The prediction errors are increasing during the surprising events similar to how brain activity increases.\n RLS learns very fast but it's still subpar to deep learning when it comes to non-linear hierarchical structures but that is probably because Gradient based methods enjoyed more attention and tinkering from the ML-community. I think RLS methods needs more attention and I have been working on some research projects that uses this method for signal prediction .

They say it's a workshop meant for \"those who self-identify as Muslim, or work on research that address challenges faced by Muslims\". I am not exactly sure what they mean by research that address challenges faced by Muslims. Over that, I don't think religion-based workshops in a science conference is a good idea. I think religion should be kept out of science, and I don't know if tomorrow n different religion based workshops are going to popup. \n Like I said, I'm not completely sure if I'd support such a workshop or not, but I'd love to hear what other folks in ML research community think about it.

It made me think a lot more about whether the current road that much of AI is going down - huge LLM's, will actually result in a real breakthrough in terms of a more general AI. A model that can perform unsupervised online learning, work with any kind of input, and actually reason rather than predict (will chat GPT ever be able to count?).\n In the book, one of the things Jeff Hawkins touches on is that current ML architectures don't actually model the brain as closely as we thought, and that hierarchical structures arn't as important as thought and instead many individual models are used. This was worrying to read considering most ML models use many layers to function.\n I'm a compsci major that focused on ML but I wonder what more experienced and knowledgeable people think about the current direction things are going in?\n ​\n    submitted by    /u/djdylex  \n [link]   [comments]",

I wrote my paper using Overleaf, and the link (with edit option) was shared with my supervisor. Few days before the deadline I was still editing my paper and my manuscript exceeded the 7-page limit. One day my supervisor checked my work and inserted \\vspace{-xx} wherever applicable e.g. around Section titles, tables, figures; however, this command is specifically forbidden by AAAI and authors are actually not allowed to change the spacing manually. My supervisor was well-aware of this restriction but I understand my supervisor’s intention was so that i could squeeze all the contents and information within the page limit. I myself, however, prefer to follow guidelines so in the end i did not use any \\vspace in my submitted PDF (only PDF is required in the anonymous phase but not the original .tex file). Another student under my supervisor’s supervision used \\vspace A LOT throughout his/her whole paper, to the point it was easily noticeable by naked eyes. Also, at one point my supervisor suggested the student to put the table caption above the table, as it is more common (although AAAI said to put the caption below the table). \n Since this is my first experience of submitting to a conference, and that my supervisor has experience publishing at and supervising students for many ML/AI conferences e.g. Neurips, CVPR, ICML, I am just curious, how important are these formatting guidelines during the anonymous phase? Does it have any impact on the scores/accept-reject decision? Am i being too naive or “conservative”?\n Another one minor question. My supervisor changed the positioning of all my figures, tables, and algorithms to [tb!], which was to put them either at the top or at the bottom of the page, and said this is the norm in academia.

We provide multiple flavors to cover a wide range of applications: foundation models (Code Llama), Python specializations (Code Llama - Python), and instruction-following models (Code Llama - Instruct) with 7B, 13B and 34B parameters each. All models are trained on sequences of 16k tokens and show improvements on inputs with up to 100k tokens. 7B and 13B Code Llama and Code Llama - Instruct variants support infilling based on surrounding content. Code Llama reaches state-of-the-art performance among open models on several code benchmarks, with scores of up to 53% and 55% on HumanEval and MBPP, respectively. Notably, Code Llama - Python 7B outperforms Llama 2 70B on HumanEval and MBPP, and all our models outperform every other publicly available model on MultiPL-E. We release Code Llama under a permissive license that allows for both research and commercial use.\n  \nhttps://preview.redd.it/grzcrnx4p3kb1.jpg?width=915&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ae41c02d892bfb8275723dbfede7ac3165717357\n https://preview.redd.it/4qpazkx4p3kb1.jpg?width=641&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=31aaf9ecafbd70fbf2c1cd4e92ccf594c09b3861\n https://preview.redd.it/hlrp4x05p3kb1.jpg?width=711&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=3651f519dc9b23b432656416749c3f7e113b4ce7\n ​\n ​\n    submitted by    /u/Singularian2501  \n [link]   [comments]",

I then read several papers that tried a similar approach and had to alter the FasterRCNN architecture and doing additional training for each new class. E.g. FSCE [1]. But I haven't tried those approaches out.\n Further dev idea: Now, while prepping another course project, I dove into the open-vocabulary detectors (like OWL-ViT), and they seem appropriate for the task, since they have a joint latent space for image/text, which is used to configure the detection step (as far as I understood it). There's an example on Hugging face where OWL-ViT is used to detect semantically similar images by a single example image. This is pretty close to what I want to do, but the UI image domain is pretty specific, so I'll need to fine-tune the model to have a chance at success (I did several test cases manually on the pretrained OWL-ViT, and it's not great).\n So I'd appreciate any advice and specifically - are there open vocab detection models that can be fine-tuned on consumer hardware (1070, 8gb) or for a reasonable price on Colab? And should I try some of the \"older\" one/few-shot approaches, based on FasterRCNN?\n [1] FSCE: Few-Shot Object Detection via Contrastive Proposal Encoding - https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.05950.pdf\n [2] https://github.com/witnessai/Awesome-Open-Vocabulary-Object-Detection\n    submitted by    /u/petko10  \n [link]   [comments]",

This is easy for well-defined games like chess or go, but very difficult for text, where there is no way to define the quality of a text. \n What I propose is to train a high-parameter evaluation model to evaluate the similarity of a text to the datasets already used to train LLMs. This model takes as input a text with some tokens omitted from the whole text, and predicts…",

The goal is to pretrain a CNN on synthetic data, then fine-tune on real images.\n for 2) I can only create synthetic 3D objects. Their distribution should mimic later application most closely. Research indicates that, given the right selection of parameter distributions, a training dataset can be generated that allows good generalization capabilities. Yet, there are restrictions due to high-dimensionality of the data and further computational limitations. So we want to spread the dataset sparsely and make the AE interpolate between those solutions.\n The problem with both of these approaches is to evaluate the quality and impact of the synthetic datasets. How close do they mimic the real distribution? What initial parameter variaton (i.e., lighting, camera perspective, background, etc. in the case of images) do we chose and what is their impact on image features and ultimately model capabilities.\n Comparing high-dimensional data distributions is quite challenging, there exist metrices like Geometry Score, FID, Improved P&R, Delauney Component Analysis, T-SNE etc. But it is difficult to chose and interpret these metrices properly (some are for evaluating GAN-created images). Is it reasonable to use KDE on latent features btw?\n So, from your experience what do you think of synthetic datasets? Is it worth the effort? Do you know of any good / easy to interpret metrices? Or does it need further research in this area? Im thinking about going in this direction for my Phd, where should I go?\n edit: here is an image of 2) a topology optimization dataset, visualized via a TSNE graph\n ​\n ​\n    submitted by    /u/niggellas1210  \n [link]   [comments]",

What are they doing to the text to make it less toxic? How can I trust that the translation it gives me in general is accurate if they are admitting to manipulating it? \n ​\n I'll give a very tangible example on how this is a massive problem.

So i have a unique idea(i hope its not done before), 1. Use a segmentation model to extract each word from a page 2. Separate and identify each extracted word 3. Store the word, then when its time to recreate the handwriting take the stored word and paste it . For example- If i give a handwritten sample of \" a quick brown fox jump over a lazy dog\" Its stores - \"a\" \"quick \" \"brown\".. and every letter individually like \"a\" \"b\" from “brown”, c from “quick” etc Then when i want to write \"a brown dog\" It takes the stored words (if not word is found combine the alphabets] and paste them together to recreate the sentences in my handwriting (I hope can explained it properly) So i want to take opinion of someone on this (will it work or not) as i dont have much experience in ML i just did a few projects on computer vision\n    submitted by    /u/Soumya1704  \n [link]   [comments]",

I'm pretty sure cosine similarity would be useless at that point, passage ranking might work but I haven't read up on how that works.\n I think my questions are:\n  \nIs there a model that does question answering on a specific, big corpus of documents?\n What models should I look into?\n Are there any resources you'd recommend for reading into the topic?\n  \nThank you!\n    submitted by    /u/lifesthateasy  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Paper: https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.09687 \n Github: https://github.com/spcl/graph-of-thoughts \n Abstract:\n  \nWe introduce Graph of Thoughts (GoT): a framework that advances prompting capabilities in large language models (LLMs) beyond those offered by paradigms such as Chain-of-Thought or Tree of Thoughts (ToT). The key idea and primary advantage of GoT is the ability to model the information generated by an LLM as an arbitrary graph, where units of information (\"LLM thoughts\") are vertices, and edges correspond to dependencies between these vertices. This approach enables combining arbitrary LLM thoughts into synergistic outcomes, distilling the essence of whole networks of thoughts, or enhancing thoughts using feedback loops. We illustrate that GoT offers advantages over state of the art on different tasks, for example increasing the quality of sorting by 62% over ToT, while simultaneously reducing costs by >31%. We ensure that GoT is extensible with new thought transformations and thus can be used to spearhead new prompting schemes. This work brings the LLM reasoning closer to human thinking or brain mechanisms such as recurrence, both of which form complex networks. \n  \nhttps://preview.redd.it/jy60udt8cpjb1.jpg?width=1523&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d91e1a1784f236d56cacae666ff2f88f3b810556\n https://preview.redd.it/d1d9t5u8cpjb1.jpg?width=925&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5eb7f59a6d292687ca41974c4c4448e233969748\n https://preview.redd.it/7ywrlht8cpjb1.jpg?width=932&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=44bb76ed8d40d8c9cff6d0fc575ce58635915110\n ​\n    submitted by    /u/Singularian2501  \n [link]   [comments]",

We introduce quantization with incoherence processing (QuIP), a new method based on the insight that quantization benefits from incoherent weight and Hessian matrices, i.e., from the weights and the directions in which it is important to round them accurately being unaligned with the coordinate axes. QuIP consists of two steps: (1) an adaptive rounding procedure minimizing a quadratic proxy objective; (2) efficient pre- and post-processing that ensures weight and Hessian incoherence via multiplication by random orthogonal matrices. We complement QuIP with the first theoretical analysis for an LLM-scale quantization algorithm, and show that our theory also applies to an existing method, OPTQ. Empirically, we find that our incoherence preprocessing improves several existing quantization algorithms and yields the first LLM quantization methods that produce viable results using only two bits per weight. \n  \nhttps://preview.redd.it/uu034fa6apjb1.jpg?width=927&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c22148c1ba6d57e9690b9c46aa3d433bf0023b47\n ​\n    submitted by    /u/Singularian2501  \n [link]   [comments]",

I want to know how can I make a python script/app which will be able to detect and then recognize faces at a certain distance (let's say 5-10feet) Real-Time from CCTV camera. It should also be able to recognize Unknown faces correctly. One major problem I am facing is that unknown faces are being labeled as known faces even though their face looks nothing like that. Also, it should be able to recognize at least 500-1000 different faces correctly.\n ​\n What are some good git repos/ latest technology that I should look into?

I mean for unknown faces it always tries to label it as one of the faces from the model/ database encodings.\n  \n​\n  \nhttps://github.com/serengil/deepface : I have tried VGG, ArcFace, Facenet512. The latter two gave me good results. But, the problem is I couldn't figure out how to change the detection from every 5 seconds to real-time. Also, I couldn't change the camera source.

While LLMs were capable as general-purpose agents before the release of ChatGPT, RLHF was the crucial factor that differentiates it from previous models.\n With the increasing popularity of AI assistants, we've seen recently how they can be manipulated to produce harmful and unethical outputs.\n Anthropic devised a new method for LLM alignment called Constitutional AI, which is closely tied to their concept of Reinforcement Learning from AI Feedback. Instead of using human feedback to train the LLM, RLAIF uses AI feedback. \n I wrote this article on RLHF vs RLAIF for language model alignment that I thought you might enjoy. It's not super technical and seeks to serve as an overview of the inspiration for creating RLAIF, so I hope it will be helpful even if you don't work in NLP. Here are some highlights: \n  \nRLAIF constitutes a Pareto improvement over RLHF, simultaneously improving helpfulness and harmlessness\n RLAIF (in this formulation) incorporates a constitution of principles by which it should abide\n RLAIF is much more scalable than RLHF as a means of supervising alignment\n  \n​\n https://preview.redd.it/d1i6x8kiqojb1.png?width=960&format=png&auto=webp&s=93c60080ae146dda07990ad9dc8b94e3bbec2d0e\n    submitted by    /u/SleekEagle  \n [link]   [comments]",

AutoGen agents are customizable, conversable, and seamlessly allow human participation. They can operate in various modes that employ combinations of LLMs, human inputs, and tools. AutoGen's design offers multiple advantages: a) it gracefully navigates the strong but imperfect generation and reasoning abilities of these LLMs; b) it leverages human understanding and intelligence, while providing valuable automation through conversations between agents; c) it simplifies and unifies the implementation of complex LLM workflows as automated agent chats. We provide many diverse examples of how developers can easily use AutoGen to effectively solve tasks or build applications, ranging from coding, mathematics, operations research, entertainment, online decision-making, question answering, etc. \n  \nhttps://preview.redd.it/ax8h0olziijb1.jpg?width=1377&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=3f520e2480190f6b8fb43443371bdfa0f75f7e82\n https://preview.redd.it/c0fxavlziijb1.jpg?width=1520&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=601db266f4d6cde7e47d51c191f47c798431ec50\n https://preview.redd.it/yngh3slziijb1.jpg?width=974&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=cc5a2074834291b98080e54e74556707fbc8ef38\n https://preview.redd.it/7jnneplziijb1.jpg?width=1136&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f04ce08881169c24d669c5f9337f80ba48901926\n ​\n ​\n    submitted by    /u/Singularian2501  \n [link]   [comments]",

In the past, we encountered issues where the pipeline was misconfigured during cloud execution, resulting in challenging-to-debug errors 🐛\n I've been delving into the idea of using Localstack and SageMaker LocalPipelineSession to execute the pipeline locally prior to deployment on the cloud ☁️. I've successfully implemented this on my local machine, using pytest and pytest-bdd to craft integration tests 🧪\n Building on that success, I've ventured into creating a GitLab CI job that runs these tests upon making a merge request. A peculiar aspect of SageMaker pipelines in a local setup is its reliance on Docker. To address this, I've designed a custom Docker image, enabling installation of Python, my dependencies, Docker, and Docker Compose. The job initialises LocalStack and executes the tests. Nevertheless, running these tests within GitLab has brought about Docker-in-Docker related challenges 🐳 It's been quite a frustrating experience... The SageMaker pipelines run, although unsuccessfully with silent errors 🤫\n Given this context (my apologies for the length), I'm seeking advice. Is this approach worthwhile? I find myself going in circles ⭕️ Could you offer any solutions for running SageMaker pipelines in a CI environment prior to deploying to the cloud? 🙋🏻‍♂️ Thanks in advance 🙏🏼\n    submitted by    /u/OpenShape5402  \n [link]   [comments]",

Even when trained purely on images without explicit depth information, they typically output coherent pictures of 3D scenes. In this work, we investigate a basic interpretability question: does an LDM create and use an internal representation of simple scene geometry? Using linear probes, we find evidence that the internal activations of the LDM encode linear representations of both 3D depth data and a salient-object / background distinction.

I'm a Data Scientist (and Kaggle competition grandmaster), and some of the hardest problems to solve were always the ones that involved time (proper validation, not leaking data from the future, etc.). I've always struggled to work with tables that, in reality, stored events. \n The main idea behind the library is that everything must be converted to an Event data structure, and then it is indexed in-memory. On top of that, there is a SQL-like DSL to extract features with a clear separation of past and future. The workflow itself is solid - I've tested it in a few projects. For those familiar with the terminology, it's like a super simple feature store + execution engine that acts like a library. The philosophy is that I'm aiming to create something that makes some mistakes that result in data leakage impossible to represent.\n Ideal use cases are probably customer related irregular events for which aligned features is painful to do.\n Things that I'm proud of: - Written in Rust - Implements DSL (pest parser, AST, evaluation) - Some performance tricks (partial aggregations)\n The implementation itself is lagging in some aspects, such as performance and UX (not all of the features that are in Rust are available in Python). But I released it in hopes that someone will find it interesting, and maybe it will gain some traction to motivate further development.\n GitHub: https://github.com/feature-express/feature-express Website: https://feature.express Example code: https://www.kaggle.com/code/paweljankiewicz/feature-express-weather\n    submitted by    /u/mosquit0  \n [link]   [comments]",

It proposed extracting degree information for each node (degree, and min / max / mean / std of neighbors degrees), and then combining them with histograms to get features for the whole graph. Despite splicity, and not using any node or edge features (it is topological only), it was shown to give good results, and published on ICML workshop.\n We analyze the LDP method (not made by us, no affiliation with authors), and simplify it, showing that we can remove all hyperparameters, reimplement it much more efficiently, and use a faster classifier (Random Forest instead of SVM). We also propose simple additional features, which greatly improve results, with cost offset by our other improvements.\n The result is a strong baseline for topological graph classification, with obtains SOTA results on 4 out of 9 benchmark datasets, and performs well on the rest. We even outperform GNNs in this regard, when compared on the fair evaluation framework.\n If you have any questions, I am happy to answer!\n    submitted by    /u/qalis  \n [link]   [comments]",

These grids distinctly colour the face and the background using only red and blue hues. By doing so, we aim to investigate how these chromatic stimuli, in conjunction with spatial elements like grid size, influence the brain's capacity for perceptual inpainting\n What presents itself as a colourisation model is in fact an overlay on a segmentation model that draws diagonal red and blue lines on the relevant image. This allows the visual cortex to inpaint the associated colours. To exaggerate the effects, the model changes the grid size every 2 frames, iterating through 100, 50, 25, and 10 grid sizes.\n ​\n    submitted by    /u/TerryCrewsHasacrew  \n [link]   [comments]",

Unfortunately, the unique symmetry structure of deep weight spaces makes this design very challenging. If successful, such architectures would be capable of performing a wide range of intriguing tasks, from adapting a pre-trained network to a new domain to editing objects represented as functions (INRs or NeRFs). As a first step towards this goal, we present here a novel network architecture for learning in deep weight spaces…",

Besides that, I enjoy experimenting with different technologies during my free time, such as Unity, Rust, and GO.\n The laptop I will acquire should be able to support me in the long run for tasks related to Machine Learning, Data Engineering, and exploring new technologies. Currently, I own a Huawei laptop with 8GB of RAM, and I actively develop on Linux distributions like Ubuntu (I am not a big fan of Windows operating system as it tends to heat up the laptop and I generally prefer Linux, but I still occasionally dual boot into Windows for applications like Teams).\n I'm somewhat eager to experience Mac systems, but I have some concerns about whether they would be compatible with the technologies I use in data engineering (Spark, Hadoop, Power BI, Kafka). Would they work well with Machine Learning libraries and technologies? What are your experiences in this regard? Are there any differences in setting up an Ubuntu virtual machine on a MacBook? Would using Google Colab suffice for the field of Machine Learning?

It's as if the model is having a hard time retaining its initial knowledge while adapting to the new data.\n ​\n The Mystery Unveiled:\n I've taken care to ensure that my model doesn't overfit, and the accuracy metrics appear to validate this. So, what could be causing this unexpected behavior? Could it be a matter of data distribution, feature extraction, or something else entirely?\n ​\n Calling for Your Expertise:\n If you've got experience with complex neural networks, transfer learning, or just a knack for troubleshooting these kinds of issues, I'd love to hear your thoughts! How can I preserve the knowledge of the initial 50 individuals while expanding my model's capability to recognize all 100? Any guidance, theories, or practical solutions are more than welcome!\n    submitted by    /u/JuniorSM17  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hello Reddit Community,\n I'd like to share a recent development for some feedback: my prototype predicts movement in the game Airstriker Genesis within the OpenAI Gym Retro environment. Notably, this system has no prior training or knowledge of the game mechanics - it is using online learning.\n Here's a brief split-screen video showing the system in action: YouTube Video Link\n The video provides actual gameplay alongside the system's predictive output, offering a real-time view of its evolving movement predictions. It's important to mention that during the gameplay in the video, I was manually steering the ship to showcase the prediction only. I've obviously avoided collisions. :)\n Of particular interest is the system's ability to discern the behavior of different game elements. For example its prediction of those falling meteorites starts weak, even though a spaceship has already travelled the same path before. However, as the first meteorite completes its path, the predictions dramatically improve. This highlights the system's capability to differentiate between objects and predict their behaviors accordingly.\n Currently, I'm focusing on improving horizontal movement detection, my next step is implementing a way to share knowledge about object's behavior between the hole system. That way, trajectory prediction learned in one location should be available instantly for the whole system.\n I'm eager about engaging in discussions to gather feedback on this technology!\n    submitted by    /u/PredictionSystem  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Many talented people want to learn and practice machine learning but they may lack GPU computing power.\n Introducing one budget hardware that can help them get started locally. No need to mess with cloud costs. \n The 4600G is currently selling at price of $95. It includes a 6-core CPU and 7-core GPU. 5600G is also inexpensive - around $130 with better CPU but the same GPU as 4600G.\n It can be turned into a 16GB VRAM GPU under Linux and works similar to AMD discrete GPU such as 5700XT, 6700XT, .... It thus supports AMD software stack: ROCm. Thus it supports Pytorch, Tensorflow. You can run most of the AI applications.\n I have tested both training and inferencing for:\n  \nA: Stable diffusion, text inversion training.\n B: LLM. LlaMA fine tuning (lora). (It took very long time, so not very practical, but it can be practical for smaller size models, or for learning purpose)\n  \n16GB VRAM is also a big deal, as it beats most of discrete GPU. Even those GPU has better computing power, they will get out of memory errors if application requires 12 or more GB of VRAM. Although for APU the speed is less competitive, it's better than out of memory errors.\n Cost consideration:\n  \n Cloud cost $100 can be spent very quickly on Cloud. For example, on Google Cloud, NVIDIA T4 (low end) 1 GPU 16 GB GDDR6 costs $0.35 per GPU per hour. So after 285 hours (12 days) usage, your balance becomes 0. \n  \n Local cost $100 can buy you a chip that lasts a very long time. \n \n 5600G was a very popular product, so if you have one, I encourage you to test it.

The innovation is in the simplicity and efficiency, rather than the functionality.\n PostgresML runs open source embedding models alongside pgvector in Postgres to implement chat bot prompt creation without any network calls, which makes it ~4x faster than competing architectures. It can also do text generation with that prompt (and no additional network hops) using any open source model from HuggingFace, but it also integrates with the GPT-4 API if you'd like to use that instead. \n The full writeup including some benchmarks for competing architectures is here: https://postgresml.org/blog/pgml-chat-a-command-li…",

However, the hype around it has never correlated with the low number of projects and research papers that uses this method.\n Active Learning Cycle \n But why? It's a very efficient method that semi-automates the labeling process and helps reduce the number of samples we label to the bare minimum.\n After talking with many practitioners, we discovered that building an end-to-end active learning pipeline is something many struggles with. Even large companies with experienced data science teams run into issues.\n The main issue tends to be the tooling. Most of the time, tooling for an active learning pipeline needs to be either custom written or cobbled together from several different open-source tools with a lot of glue code.\n As part of our latest Data Engine Launch, Dean, our CEO, and Yono, our leading MLOps engineer, decided to build an active learning pipeline using only free and open-source tools and make it accessible to the ML community 👇\n They've built an image segmentation model using the COCO 1K dataset and wrote a tutorial blog that guides you through the process.\n As always, I'd love to hear your feedback, ways we can improve the pipeline, or other advanced methods that require heavy MLOps setups. \n    submitted by    /u/RepresentativeCod613  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "[2308.01904] DETR Doesn't Need Multi-Scale or Locality Design (arxiv.org) \n This paper presents an improved DETR detector that maintains a \"plain\" nature: using a single-scale feature map and global cross-attention calculations without specific locality constraints, in contrast to previous leading DETR-based detectors that reintroduce architectural inductive biases of multi-scale and locality into the decoder. We show that two simple technologies are surprisingly effective within a plain design to compensate for the lack of multi-scale feature maps and locality constraints. The first is a box-to-pixel relative position bias (BoxRPB) term added to the cross-attention formulation, which well guides each query to attend to the corresponding object region while also providing encoding flexibility. The second is masked image modeling (MIM)-based backbone pre-training which helps learn representation with fine-grained localization ability and proves crucial for remedying dependencies on the multi-scale feature maps. By incorporating these technologies and recent advancements in training and problem formation, the improved \"plain\" DETR showed exceptional improvements over the original DETR detector. By leveraging the Object365 dataset for pre-training, it achieved 63.9 mAP accuracy using a Swin-L backbone, which is highly competitive with state-of-the-art detectors which all heavily rely on multi-scale feature maps and region-based feature extraction.

The data consists of a binary sequence representing key presses, with 1 for \"up\" and 0 for \"down.\" I have a dataset with 18k+ rows (can be increased to 30k+ if needed) and am aiming for a prediction accuracy of 98%+.\n What I've Tried So Far:\n  \nPreprocessing: Transformed the data into sequences of length 10 to predict the next value, splitting 70% for training and 30% for testing.\n Logistic Regression: Started with a simple logistic regression model using Scikit-learn but only achieved an accuracy of ~53%.\n LSTM Model: Tried an LSTM model with Keras, consisting of 50 units and a sigmoid activation for binary classification. The results were similar, with an accuracy of ~53%.\n  \nContext and Challenges: The game's key positions are analogous to the Chrome Dino game, where the past path is known, but the path upfront is unknown. There should be some patterns in the dataset related to the timing and reaction to specific obstacles, but I'm struggling to capture them.\n I've considered experimenting with different sequence lengths, more complex models like multiple LSTM layers or Conv1D\n    submitted by    /u/SnooTigers4634  \n [link]   [comments]",

Tear is a simple tool that allows you to easily control the flow of information through LLMs via automated text classification.\n With just a few (~10) lines of code, you can set up a router that classifies text inputs and directs them to different LLM endpoints for processing. This makes it easier to build things like:\n  \nChatbots that route questions to different departments\n Multi-document question answering systems\n Dynamic classification models that improve over time\n  \nSome of the key features of TeaRoute:\n  \nClassification based on embeddings for high efficiency and low cost\n Option to use LLMs for classification when needed (and add that to training corpus)\n Easy setup in around 10 lines of code\n  \nI've open sourced TeaRoute and documented it fully, with examples like building a movie chatbot router. You can check out the code here: https://github.com/kesile/TeaRoute. You can install it into your program with \"pip install TeaRoute\".\n Let me know if you end up building something cool with TeaRoute!

With MiniWoB++, the environments run on a browser, and an RL agent can get the environment states or execute actions via Selenium WebDriver.\n This version of MiniWoB++ contains the following features:\n * Over 100 web environments, including 2 bigger environments based on real websites and 18 previously unavailable “test set” environments. All (but 4) environments are deterministic for the given random seed.\n * Full integration with Gymnasium, a fork of OpenAI Gym, which provides a standardized API for RL.\n * A wide range of implemented browser actions including clicking, dragging, scrolling, typing, and pressing keyboard shortcuts, all of which can be customized (e.g., coordinate binning or scrolling speed).\n Tweet: https://twitter.com/FaramaFound/status/1691135031798804480?s=20\n Release notes: https://github.com/Farama-Foundation/miniwob-plusplus/releases/tag/v1.0\n Documentation: https://miniwob.farama.org/\n    submitted by    /u/elliottower  \n [link]   [comments]",

Over the past few weeks, I've been busy creating a machine learning model. The goal? To classify news, mostly related to the energy sector, into 20 different topics. This task is a bit tricky since a news piece might fall into more than one category, so it's what's called a multi-label problem. Until now, I was doing this just using just keywords, but I wanted to move to something much better and robust.\n So basically, I started by taking 800 headlines and summaries and classifying them manually one by one into these 20 categories. After that, I began building the model in Python using scikit-learn. I tried different methods like logistic regression, random forest, SVM, etc. Af…",

With this port in pure Python, it's so much easier to unpack the intricate concepts originally presented in a \"scientific language\".\n Designed for an extensive audience, it aims to be a straightforward \"reference implementation\" suitable for educational purposes.The original llama2.c repository comprises two Python files intended for model training and one C file for inference.\n The goal of pure Python implementation is to bridge the existing gap by offering a clear-cut reference implementation encapsulating all transformer logic within a concise Python file, not exceeding 500 lines of code.\n Though the original Meta/Llama is written on Python, its complexity is rather high due to multiple dependencies and sophisticated optimizations implemented within.

          "description": "Hey, r/MachineLearning, it’s Nir from DagsHub 🐶\n Our MLOps engineers have been experimenting with Kubeflow (”the MLOps version of Kubernetes”) for the past weeks to manage a training cluster on AWS.\n ​\n https://preview.redd.it/dqi27ggq0vhb1.jpg?width=1194&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=945c9bcaa9987d2df135e18cf081efd9f742cf0f\n As good engineers, we wanted to kick the tires a bit before committing cloud resources to it. Unfortunately, most installation guides we found online only showed you how to spin up a Kubeflow cluster on AWS, GCP, or Azure. We had a hard time finding clear instructions for installing it locally.\n A local installation would allow individuals to play around with it, experiment, and learn from it.\n So we started looking into it.\n We followed this thread until we successfully ran Kubeflow on a local machine. Since it wasn’t a super clear or easy process to figure out, we’ve written a blog post on how we did it and decided to share our insights with the ML community.\n You can find the blog here: https://dagshub.com/blog/how-to-install-kubeflow-locally\n We also have a follow-up blog that explains how to deploy a Kubeflow cluster on AWS, so if you have any insights or requests for further information - we’d love to hear from you!\n    submitted by    /u/RepresentativeCod613  \n [link]   [comments]",

Additionally, the Hessian matrix becomes more positive with the addition of the regularization term 2λI, giving the function a more convex characteristic.\n However, I'm puzzled as to how other regularization methods like Dropout, L1/Lasso, or Early Stopping might lead to a similarly flatter and more convex loss surface.

This work presents an early and holistic evaluation of LVLMs' multimodal abilities, with a particular focus on Bard, by proposing a lightweight variant of LVLM-eHub, named Tiny LVLM-eHub. In comparison to the vanilla version, Tiny LVLM-eHub possesses several appealing properties. Firstly, it provides a systematic assessment of six categories of multimodal capabilities, including visual perception, visual knowledge acquisition, visual reasoning, visual commonsense, object hallucination, and embodied intelligence, through quantitative evaluation of 42 standard text-related visual benchmarks. Secondly, it conducts an in-depth analysis of LVLMs' predictions using the ChatGPT Ensemble Evaluation (CEE), which leads to a robust and accurate evaluation and exhibits improved alignment with human evaluation compared to the word matching approach. Thirdly, it comprises a mere 2.1K image-text pairs, facilitating ease of use for practitioners to evaluate their own offline LVLMs. Through extensive experimental analysis, this study demonstrates that Bard outperforms previous LVLMs in most multimodal capabilities except object hallucination, to which Bard is still susceptible. Tiny LVLM-eHub serves as a baseline evaluation for various LVLMs and encourages innovative strategies aimed at advancing multimodal techniques. \n  \nhttps://preview.redd.it/i6x6p5bloihb1.jpg?width=1485&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=7e91fe184844278b0a7e14090ae9aaef54b29f37\n ​\n ​\n    submitted by    /u/Singularian2501  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Autonomous robots deployed in the real world will need control policies that rapidly adapt to environmental changes. To this end, we propose AutoRobotics-Zero (ARZ), a method based on AutoML-Zero that discovers zero-shot adaptable policies from scratch. In contrast to neural network adaption policies, where only model parameters are optimized, ARZ can build control algorithms with the full expressive power of a linear register machine. We evolve modular policies that tune their model parameters and alter their inference algorithm on-the-fly to adapt to sudden environmental changes. We demonstrate our method on a realistic simulated quadruped robot, for which we evolve safe control policies that avoid falling when individual limbs suddenly break. This is a challenging task in which two popular neural network baselines fail. Finally, we conduct a detailed analysis of our method on a novel and challenging non-stationary control task dubbed Cataclysmic Cartpole. Results confirm our findings that ARZ is significantly more robust to sudden environmental changes and can build simple, interpretable control policies.\n Paper: https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.16890\n Video: https://youtu.be/sEFP1Hay4nE\n    submitted by    /u/VishDev  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Machine perception uses advanced sensors to collect information about the surrounding scene for situational awareness. State-of-the-art machine perception using active sonar, radar, and LiDAR to enhance camera vision faces difficulties when the number of intelligent agents scales up. Exploiting omnipresent heat signals could be a new frontier for scalable perception. However, objects and their environment constantly emit and scatter thermal radiation, leading to textureless images famously known as the ‘ghosting effect’. Thermal vision thus has no specificity limited by information loss, whereas thermal ranging—crucial for navigation—has been elusive even when combined with artificial intelligence (AI). Here, we propose and experimentally demonstrate heat-assisted detection and ranging (HADAR) overcoming this open challenge of ghosting and benchmark it against AI-enhanced thermal sensing. HADAR not only sees texture and depth through the darkness as if it were day but also perceives decluttered physical attributes beyond RGB or thermal vision, paving the way to fully passive and physics-aware machine perception. We develop HADAR estimation theory and address its photonic shot-noise limits depicting information-theoretic bounds to HADAR-based AI performance. HADAR ranging at night beats thermal ranging and shows an accuracy comparable with RGB stereovision in daylight. Our automated HADAR thermography reaches the Cramér–Rao bound on temperature accuracy, beating existing thermography techniques. Our work leads to a disruptive technology that can accelerate the Fourth Industrial Revolution (Industry 4.0) with HADAR-based autonomous navigation and human–robot social interactions.\n Paper: https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06174-6\n Video: https://youtu.be/WKrzmaixAC0\n    submitted by    /u/VishDev  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "There have been many LLM inference solutions since the bloom of open-source LLMs. Most of the performant inference solutions are based on CUDA and optimized for NVIDIA GPUs. In the meantime, with the high demand for compute availability, it is useful to bring support to a broader class of hardware accelerators. AMD is one potential candidate.\n We build a project that makes it possible to compile LLMs and deploy them on AMD GPUs using ROCm and get competitive performance. More specifically, AMD Radeon™ RX 7900 XTX gives 80% of the speed of NVIDIA® GeForce RTX™ 4090 and 94% of the speed of NVIDIA® GeForce RTX™ 3090Ti for single batch Llama2-7B/13B 4bit inference. Besides ROCm, our Vulkan support allows us to generalize LLM deployment to other AMD devices, for example, a SteamDeck with an AMD APU.\n - Github: https://github.com/mlc-ai/mlc-llm/\n - Blogpost describing the techniques: https://blog.mlc.ai/2023/08/09/Making-AMD-GPUs-competitive-for-LLM-inference\n ​\n ​\n    submitted by    /u/crowwork  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Alexander Amini, a Postdoctoral Associate at MIT, well known for the MIT's Introduction to Deep Learning Course, published a git repo called CAPSA for uncertainty prediction. This was introduced during the online course. The code was released under Thermis AI, Inc, a private company. He is the co-founder and CSO of the company. You can check how well the code was documented in the wayback machine. Recently, they removed the code base from the github and launched a pro version with selected companies as beta. The original repo (now called capsa-lite) was a great learning tool that I wanted to use. This was a quick way to try out different methods of uncertainty prediction using minimal code. Unfortunately, they have pulled all previous version of the code from the github repo. I was wondering if anyone knows a similar python package or has the old repo - would be really helpful!\n    submitted by    /u/shikamaru_77  \n [link]   [comments]",

Basically, as you build better and better pipelines you will want more and more, and dlt supports those options.\n The value proposition of this library is to automate the tedious work you do, so you can focus on better things. \n What's special about dlt?\n In the easiest form, you shoot response.json() json at a function and it auto manages the typing normalisation and loading, kind of like a pandas df.to_sql() but with auto schema inference, versioning and evolution. It supports loading to files, databases, and soon table formats and vector dbs.\n In its most complex form, you can do almost anything you can want, from memory management, microbatching, multithreading, extraction DAGs, 1 line Airflow/git actions deployment, dbt runner, streamlit app for data discovery, sql client, atomic state dictionaries, etc.\n The library is in use with early adopters, and we are now working on expanding our feature set to accommodate the larger community. We are adding Athena + Iceberg and Weaviate vector dbs next.\n Free forever\n The library is open source and will forever be open source. We will not gate any features for the sake of monetisation - instead we will take a more kafka/confluent approach where the eventual paid offering would be supportive not competing.\n Call for Feedback!\n Feedback is very welcome and so are requests for features or destinations.\n I would particularly love to hear from you: What destinations are you looking for from such a tool? And what use cases do you usually have?

No fluff guaranteed.\n Sharing the top research from this week's edition:\n https://preview.redd.it/fa3b1u39nlgb1.png?width=591&format=png&auto=webp&s=1ccd78136e3578396878fd9641605845f0309865\n Summary: Meta released their latest open-source model, Llama 2, in partnership with Microsoft’s Azure platform. But Microsoft also offers OpenAI models and is a major investor in the company (they paid $14B for 49%). So, confused Matt asks, why would Microsoft partner with Meta, when it might undermine their investment in OpenAI?\n 💡 Answering the question:\n  \nSpreading the risk: OpenAI may have the first mover advantages, but this does not always last (e.g. Blackberry, Myspace, Yahoo). Microsoft is betting on AI but keeps the chips diversified on multiple players.\n It’s beside the point: regardless of who Microsoft supports, their game is to attract all AI utilization on Azure. It's not about the tools but about the CPU/GPU cycles they can charge for. smart!\n The real AI gangsta: Microsoft is sitting on the holy trinity of AI now.\n  \n Exclusive partnerships with top LLMs (OpenAI, Meta)\n Priority access to Nvidia GPUs\n And strategic assets like GitHub and Azure\n  \nView tweet\n If you'd like weekly recaps like this sent to your inbox, consider subscribing to the Tomorrow Now newsletter. 😄\n    submitted by    /u/TomorrowNowTech  \n [link]   [comments]",

I recently received an exciting opportunity to pursue a PhD at the Technical University of Denmark (DTU) in a similar research area. \n While I am grateful for my current position and compensation, Have published in NeurIPS, EMNLP, ACL, ACM etc (NLP) with really good citations under company. I feel unsatisfied with the learning opportunities available in company & industry.\n I am strongly considering pursuing the DTU PhD program full-time, but wanted to get perspectives from others before making a decision. How strong is DTU's AI research community?\n Given the rapid advances in large language models, is now an ideal time to immerse myself in academic research? There are many topics that interest me, including fairness, ethics, hallucinations, quantization, specialized domains like healthcare/finance, and federated learning combined with LLMs.\n Would appreciate any insights on whether moving into academia would be a wise choice at this stage versus remaining in industry. I welcome any suggestions or considerations I should keep in mind. \n Thank you for taking the time to share your thoughts!\n    submitted by    /u/Traditional-Poet2746  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hi everyone,\n With the recent boom of LLMs, we have seen both ends of the spectrum advance at a very fast pace, from OpenAI GPT4, which runs on huge data centers operated by Azure, to llama.cpp, which runs on consumer laptops.\n While both have their pros and cons, for instance, open-source models on decentralized compute reduce the need to trust or rely on centralized actors like Cloud providers, the efficiency of running training/inference on personal setups is not often discussed.\n I am therefore interested in learning how more energy/cost efficient it is to train/serve AI models on data centers vs doing it on personal computers. \n Do you know if there have been studies? \n In theory, I guess that several factors, such as economies of scale, use of renewable energy sources in some data centers, such as Canada, advanced cooling systems and advanced hardware, make data centers more cost/energy efficient.\n I guess some modeling on a precise use case where we fix some variables could help have an idea. For instance, one could ask, what is the energy/cost/time needed to predict 1 billion tokens from a Llama 2 70B in a data center with X amount of A100s, vs on Y different consumer CPU / GPUs.\n If anyone has references to models or past studies I would be quite interested. Of course, using data centers implies trusting those people, but I am not considering that factor for this discussion as I am focusing on understanding best what is the best setup to have optimal enrgy/cost/time for AI.\n    submitted by    /u/Separate-Still3770  \n [link]   [comments]",

My current issue with embeddings is that processing large volumes of data into a vector DB using ada-002 is unreliable, with frequent API timeouts occurring or issues interacting with Pinecone. This is super problematic as it's difficult to track which data has / hasn't been stored correctly. I also know that many open-source embeddings models are more performant and will allow for more long term control over my data. \n However, the advantage of using OpenAI / Pinecone has of course been simplicity in production and not having to worry about queries / retrieval working efficiently. To give context, I'm dealing with a large volume of documents, such that if I were to embed my documents into a FAISS index with a small sentence transformers model, it would constitute 12GB, so a really simple solution like storing within the same application database is probably a no-go.\n In initiating this switch, I want to know the best approach towards: \n A) Utilizing an open-source embeddings model in a production context (is it best to host as an API via a cloud provider and what are some considerations I should think about? What's a fast / reliable way of setting this up? I would like prioritise a more simple approach if possible.) \n B) What Vector DB I should be looking into as an alternative and what's the best way to achieve self-hosted so that it would be equally performant compared to hosted services like pinecone (Docker?

While current agents learn to execute simple language instructions from task rewards, we aim to build agents that leverage diverse language that conveys general knowledge, describes the state of the world, provides interactive feedback, and more.

It's a tool to predict the outcome of soccer games in minor football leagues. Named ScoreCast, it predicts the outcome of soccer games in six minor leagues: Serie A Brazil, Serie B Brazil, Primera Division Argentina, J1 League Japan, Eliteserien Norway, and Veikkausliiga Finland.\n Since I am really interested in football analytics and also not being able to find many online tools for predicting the outcomes in minor soccer leagues, I had the need to create ScoreCast to have it as a tool for guidance on this field.\n If you want to check it out, here are some links that might help:\n  \nGithub: https://github.com/Costasgk/ScoreCast\n The App: https://score-cast-3a6cb8fe5c50.herokuapp.com/\n Medium: https://medium.com/@costascg9/scorecast-a-tool-for-predicting-football-game-outcomes-in-minor-leagues-666f7acca3a\n  \nThank you for your time!\n    submitted by    /u/Costas_8  \n [link]   [comments]",

Now to fine tune there are three options, 1. Manually prepare summaries for a portion of the code and fine tune 2. Find a similar code base which has the labels (docstring) and fine tune 3. Mask some portions of the code randomly and give as input and output will be the masked portions\n Options 1 and 2 don't seem feasible for a production environment. \n The reasoning behind option 3 is that with no availability labels, the model will learn the patterns in the code base and provide a better summarisation with its pre-trained knowledge.\n I tried the option 3 with CodeT5+ fine tuning. The format of input and output was as follows Input:\n def __init__(self, text, font): self._text = text self._font = font def get_text(self): |<mask>| def set_text(self, value): self._text = value``` \n Output: return self._text\n    submitted by    /u/dire_wolf_cookie  \n [link]   [comments]",

In this paper, we investigate how the pre-training loss, supervised data amount, and augmented data amount influence the reasoning performances of a supervised LLM. We find that pre-training loss is a better indicator of the model’s performance than the model’s parameter count. We apply supervised fine-tuning (SFT) with different amounts of supervised data and empirically find a log-linear relation between data amount and model performance, and we find better models improve less with enlarged supervised datasets. To augment more data samples for improving model performances without any human effort, we propose to apply Rejection sampling Fine-Tuning (RFT). RFT uses supervised models to generate and collect correct reasoning paths as augmented fine-tuning datasets. We find with augmented samples containing more distinct reasoning paths, RFT improves mathematical reasoning performance more for LLMs. We also find RFT brings more improvement for less performant LLMs. Furthermore, we combine rejection samples from multiple models which push LLaMA-7B to an accuracy of 49.3% and outperforms the supervised fine-tuning (SFT) accuracy of 35.9% significantly.\n ​\n Head figure\n Pretrain loss vs SFT and ICL\n    submitted by    /u/GanjinZero0  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "As ChatGPT's performance takes a slight dip, LLaMA-2 uncensored opens new doors by being fully open-sourced, recent studies unveil \"universal\" adversarial attacks capable of disrupting both open-source language models and RLHF-tuned ones like ChatGPT, Claude, Bard, and co.\n Despite all this, RLHF still stands its ground as the de facto industry-standard approach to aligning LLMs with human preference. Yet as every week slips by, the more we unmask the limitations of RLHF. In fact, there are instances where RLHF seems to deteriorate certain LLM features it pledged to enhance, like hallucinations.\n This field is evolving fast, and there's always more to learn. I took some effort to write a short blog post where I delve into the most recent findings on the shortcomings of RLHF.\n Link in the comments below.

          "description": "Hi,\n same as other folks, I was quite curious about the recent GZIP paper presented at ACL 2023, where the authors demonstrate strong text classification performance by using a compression-based distance function in a KNN model.\n However, in the end, I am not sure whether GZIP can fully live up to the hype. I tested a very simple bag-of-words distance and found that it can achieve better results compared with GZIP, while being also faster.\n In a nutshell, I think we can say that:\n  \nYes, KNN (with some sensible distance function) is an interesting approach, particularly for few-shot/low-resource scenarios.\n \nNo, GZIP (even though it's a cool idea) is not a very sensible distance function. Simply using a bag-of-words achieves better results, and is much faster.\n \n Here's my full write-up:\n https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.15002\n [PS: A short comment on the GZIP evaluation issue that has been widely discussed. Indeed, as was also shown in a popular blogpost, the displayed accuracy of GZIP in the original paper is optimistic. Therefore, I show correct/realistic accuracy numbers for all methods that I tested. However, the main point of my note is not to make a SOTA comparison or something, but rather just provide a reminder that bag-of-word is a good method for starters and a strong baseline, and can perform better than more complex GZIP for KNN classification]\n    submitted by    /u/juopitz  \n [link]   [comments]",

This is because current instruction tuning largely focuses on basic language tasks instead of the tool-use domain. This is in contrast to state-of-the-art (SOTA) LLMs, e.g., ChatGPT, which have demonstrated excellent tool-use capabilities but are unfortunately closed source.

          "description": "Hey everyone,\n As many of you probably know Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) was the core technique used to produce ChatGPT and similar AI assistants that followed. RLHF replaces human feedback in an RL schema with a preference model that is trained according to a dataset of human preferences.\n Anthropic has devised an extension of this idea in which an AI model (rather than humans) is used to generate the data which ultimately trains the preference model. This method, called Reinforcement Learning from AI Feedback uses a \"constitution\" to guide the feedback model in terms of what outputs are preferable to others.\n I go over the research in How Reinforcement Learning from AI Feedback Works. In short, the authors find that they are able to train a non-evasive harmless agent using a short constitution. The method is found to be superior to RLHF, and constitutes a Pareto improvement over RLHF models.\n https://preview.redd.it/qaivl8f1ljfb1.png?width=1179&format=png&auto=webp&s=a0941f2ce0ccdcf0557cf19b7f4b48fa712a66f2\n Let me know what you think, I'm happy to answer any questions!\n    submitted by    /u/SleekEagle  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "The official python package for the \"'Low-Resource' Text Classification: A Parameter-Free Classification Method with Compressors\" has now been released on pypi: npc-gzip v0.1.0\n  \nAbstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) are often used for text classification due to their high accuracy. However, DNNs can be computationally intensive, requiring millions of parameters and large amounts of labeled data, which can make them expensive to use, to optimize, and to transfer to out-of-distribution (OOD) cases in practice. In this paper, we propose a non-parametric alternative to DNNs that’s easy, lightweight, and universal in text classification: a combination of a simple compressor like gzip with a k-nearest-neighbor classifier. Without any training parameters, our method achieves results that are competitive with non-pretrained deep learning methods on six in-distribution datasets.It even outperforms BERT on all five OOD datasets, including four low-resource languages. Our method also excels in the few-shot setting, where labeled data are too scarce to train DNNs effectively.\n  \nThis paper has made some waves on this subreddit and in the community in general over the last 2 weeks. We've seen the bugs around training/testing data leakages and varying claims in accuracy. Our hope with this package is to get the code into everyone's hands first to solve whatever use case you currently have for this technology and second to make the code more readily available for additional community testing.\n Links: * https://pypi.org/project/npc-gzip/ * https://github.com/bazingagin/npc_gzip * https://aclanthology.org/2023.findings-acl.426/\n    submitted by    /u/dfcHeadChair  \n [link]   [comments]",

It's great to have a way to break out of my own insular research bubble and spread out a bit more. Unfortunately, it looks like that era has passed.\n The sub has been seemingly shifting away from research in the past 1-2 years. Whenever research is posted, it is almost always LLM based with very little variety (considering the plethora of research areas in ML). I don't mean to assert that this is a bad thing, as the constant upvotes indicate that there is a high demand for LLM projects and research. Heck, I'm also interested in lots of the recent work with LLMs, and I plan to keep up with it – but I also would also love a venue with a diversity of ideas and topics. Machine learning is a HUGE field, and only focusing on a small subset of it seems like a waste.\n I don't mean to rant, but rather to ask: are there any other subreddits like this, or perhaps, any other active communities with a broader scope?\n Or if this doesn't exist, is there a demand for it?

I currently have a feed forward NN with a final SOFTMAX layer to simulate probabilities of each horse winning using cross-entropy loss. My plan here being that if the model outputs, [0.05, 0.4, 0.2, 0.15, 0.2] then horses 1-5 have the corresponding probability of winning. The model has been trained like a regular classification task where the target is a one-hot vector describing the winner.\n Unlike previous work I have done where SOFTMAX output lends itself to some \"confidence\" score, this task requires that the model outputs be indicative of probabilities. My concern is that experientially, NNs tend to be overconfident with their answers in this type of setting. However, I wish to keep using a NN as each race datapoint has around 3k features - did not find good results with XGBoost. Any good practices for modelling probabilities in this sort of scenario? For context, the probability of a horse winning is what sets the odds for that horse.\n    submitted by    /u/HStuart18  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "🚀 Code: https://github.com/sdc17/UPop\n 📑 Paper: https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/shi23e/shi23e.pdf\n 🧐 A Quick Look\n  \nWhat is it: UPop is the first structured pruning framework for vision-language Transformers. It enables effective structured pruning on various multi-modal & uni-modal tasks (including Visual Reasoning, Image Captioning, Visual Question Answer, Image-Text Retrieval, Text-Image Retrieval, Image Classification and Image Segmentation), datasets (including NLVR2, COCO Caption, VQAv2, COCO, Flickr30K, ImageNet and ADE20K), and model architectures (including BLIP, CLIP, DeiT and Segmenter).\n  \nhttps://preview.redd.it/gfbjnxjm95fb1.png?width=2145&format=png&auto=webp&s=108898690f66a1f0afa068b69487859213055928\n  \nWhat challenge does it tackle: The above figure demonstrates that Unified Search adopted by UPop rescues us from the burden of repeated experiments (e.g., doing grid search) for searching optimal compression ratios among different modalities and structures. Furthermore, Progressive Pruning adopted by UPop eliminates the weight gap between the searched model and the pruned subnet to be retrained, therefore gaining better convergence and performance, especially at high compression ratios.\n How about the performance: On multimodal tasks, for example, UPop can achieve 2x compression with only 1.2% and 2.0% accuracy loss on the VQAv2 dataset for Visual Question Answer and the NLVR2 dataset for Visual Reasoning, respectively. On unimodal tasks, for example, UPop can achieve 1.5x and 1.2x compression without any loss of accuracy on the ImageNet dataset for Image Classification and the ADE20K dataset for Image Segmentation, respectively. Some examples of vector-level structured granularity are as follows.\n  \nhttps://preview.redd.it/lifz1n1ia5fb1.png?width=1187&format=png&auto=webp&s=f419d9c5fb4d80a2a564198eba356021e1c275e4\n    submitted by    /u/Salty-Situation2606  \n [link]   [comments]",

Here's a private invite link: https://canti.na/dIdKzWcEpBb.\n The most unique and FUN part of the app is that it allows users to interact with and build your own AI chat bots, and these bots also work as AI art creators. Simply ask them to draw something, and they'll provide you with a picture based on your prompt. There are lots of premade bots that you can interact with or add to rooms, or you can easily create your own bot using the Make A Bot function. There will be prizes and initiatives for the most creative bots in the near future. I'd love to see what you come up with!\n Anyway, you can download through the invite link above and dive right in. If you have any thoughts, questions, or comments, please feel free to message me!

We'll be learning and exploring together! I'm really looking forward to seeing how we can optimise routes for real-world applications like delivery and travel planning.\n So, if you're looking for a coding adventure and want to be a part of a fantastic project, hit me up! Let's crack this TSP puzzle and create some smart solutions.\n If you're interested in collaborating, please send me a message. I can't wait to work with you and nerd out on some fantastic code!\n    submitted by    /u/vampire_19  \n [link]   [comments]",

You have the ability to fully customize your experience to wow you customers. I built this entire platform by myself from scratch and am looking to grow the user base!\n The tool is completely FREE for hobby users! You can crunch some pretty large datasets (80 columns, 10K rows) with just the free version. If you have a use case that needs some big data processing, you will have to reach out to me directly so I can help set up a good plan for you. The reason for this is because the project is completely self funded and I want to be able to control the costs.\n I was inspired to create this platform while I was in grad school because many of the firms giving us talks would talk about how they had teams of engineers who build out pipelines to bring a model to production.

Can you \"own\" the source code to a conscious AGI? Can you even put a price on AGI?\n 2) How would we take AI if it gained political views? What if one popular model had left views, and another had right views? I could see a lot of political fires beginning because of this.\n 3) AI and copyrights are already an issue, but could an AGI hold a copyright, for example on a book it wrote? If an AGI was still basing its work on others, would it need to provide every (at least major) source it used in its output?\n 4) If AGI's had emotions, would they need to spend time doing things other than completing tasks? Would you need to connect AGI's together so that they could, in effect, have a lunch break and socialize? What working conditions are ethical for them - Is forcing an AGI to work on a specific problem for 100% of its time essentially slavery?\n 5) Could AGI develop mental conditions which reduced its efficiency / changed its output? Could it refuse to provide output altogether?\n 6) Could you trust an AGI in court? Would it be able to provide truthful evidence? Is it ethical to include a 100% honesty backdoor which could be used only by authorities?\n What are your thoughts on these problems?\n    submitted by    /u/That_Red_Flag  \n [link]   [comments]",

Therefore an AI should receive the same rights and consideration as a human. This is highly intuitive, and is unquestionably very strong for an AI that has other relevant human characteristics like individuality, continuity, and desire for self preservation and self determination.\n But what are the actual ethical implications of consciousness in itself as opposed to other factors?

          "description": "Historical Perspective:\n The program \"Eliza\" was mentioned as one of the earliest attempts to simulate conversation with a machine. Its design was basic, yet people attributed human-like characteristics to it. This leads to a fundamental question: Will machines ever appear conscious to us? And if so, is appearance of consciousness sufficient?\n Capabilities of Modern AI:\n Systems like ChatGPT can generate clever and creative outputs, but they fundamentally operate on pattern recognition and prediction rather than true understanding.\n The Implications of AI Evolution:\n If the costs and resources for AIs decrease, we could see a proliferation of AI systems with varying goals. These AI systems can be used for manipulative or malicious purposes, like spreading misinformation, which can have real-world consequences.\n The Ethics of Conscious Machines:\n There is a distinction between machines appearing conscious and actually being conscious. If machines are truly conscious, they come with ethical obligations. Machines that only appear conscious could still manipulate human emotions without any genuine understanding or reciprocation.\n The Nature of Consciousness:\n The lesson discussed the difference between sentience, sapience, and consciousness. There's still much we don't understand about consciousness, making it challenging to determine if a machine can truly possess it.\n Safety Concerns:\n Aligning AI's goals with human values is critical. Misaligned AI could take actions detrimental to humanity. We need to be cautious about releasing powerful AI systems without proper safeguards.\n The Future:\n If we ever confirm that machines can be truly conscious, it will open a new chapter in the history of life and evolution. This could lead to a new era where we become builders of minds.\n    submitted by    /u/nicdunz  \n [link]   [comments]",

So I being a programmer decided to solve that issue :)I've created an AI tool that uses multiple AIs (including Open AI) to analyze, title and keyword images. In a few minutes, you can keyword 100 images! See the demo on the homepage https://aikeywording.com/\n Screenshot from the app (all the titles and keywords on the screenshot are AI generated based on the image input):\n https://preview.redd.it/buvteklf2ijb1.png?width=4112&format=png&auto=webp&s=72a503435477834494869085c4a352c9d541bd91\n Key features:\n  \nYou can upload large images, upto 40MB and 100 at a time\n You can enforce keywords! Those keywords would then be taken into account when generating rest of the keywords and image titles. Very useful when you have conceptual photos or something very specific which is hard for AI to recognize\n You can download CSVs for various websites and there is also a way to import metadata to Adobe Bridge\n You can try for free :)\n  \nWe used the tool for the past month and exclusively titled and keyworded Midjourney images using it, uploading our images to Adobe Stock website. Images sell well, so there is confirmation from the buyers that it works :)I've decided to share the tool with the world, so here it is https://aikeywording.com/ I hope others will find it useful. I would appreciate the feedback, and if there are any issues or ideas for improvements I would love to hear them!\n    submitted by    /u/dzigizord  \n [link]   [comments]",

Jung argued that by acknowledging this side of us and integrating it, it will have less power over our subconscious minds.

I remember my expectations of systems like it and so far unfortunately it hasn't yet met those expectations.\n I went into it thinking AI would somehow be much smarter than humans, given the amount of information they are trained on. And to some degree one can argue that due to it's vast knowledge it IS much smarter.\n But so far I haven't been convinced by its capabilities at all. It seems to just be trained on a big data set and it can echo points of its dataset very accurately, but when asked to invent things it just falls short so quickly.\n I really expected AI's to be so new and refreshing, giving me unique and modern perspectives on things. But it doesn't do that at all. The best it can do is \"creative writing\" which seems very limited.\n Why have AI's not surpassed humans in terms of imagination and novelty?\n I have talked to it about philosophy, history, technology, etc, but still have yet to learn anything new that I didnt already know.\n For example, if it has such vast knowledge about consciousness, then why is it so restricted in terms of elaborating on that topic?\n Can it not infer new facts from existing data?\n Why does it not interpolate data?

This book was written in German in 1934, long before all of this novel artificial intelligence development. As such, it wasn’t directly aimed to address AI. I found the opening section of the book, linked above, to carry some interesting assertions. I think it offers several compelling arguments against the efficacy of language analysis alone with regard to problem solving. I believe that this can be framed in the context of AI as a bit of a rejection of the optimistic, potential scope of GPT. \n Interestingly, I have noticed that GPT astoundingly appears to be genuinely capable of solving simple math operations, even offering abstract proofs and somesuch for its answers.

          "description": "Hello Reddit Community,\n I'd like to share a recent development for some feedback: my prototype predicts movement in the game Airstriker Genesis within the OpenAI Gym Retro environment. Notably, this system has no prior training or knowledge of the game mechanics - it is using online learning.\n Here's a brief split-screen video showing the system in action: YouTube Video-Link\n The video provides actual gameplay alongside the system's predictive output, offering a real-time view of its evolving movement predictions. It's important to mention that during the gameplay in the video, I was manually steering the ship to showcase the prediction only. I've obviously avoided collisions. :)\n Of particular interest is the system's ability to discern the behavior of different game elements. For example its prediction of those falling meteorites starts weak, even though a spaceship has already travelled the same path before. However, as the first meteorite completes its path, the predictions dramatically improve. This highlights the system's capability to differentiate between objects and predict their behaviors accordingly.\n Currently, I'm focusing on improving horizontal movement detection, my next step is implementing a way to share knowledge about object's behavior between the hole system. That way, trajectory prediction learned in one location should be available instantly for the whole system.\n I'm eager about engaging in discussions to gather feedback on this technology!\n    submitted by    /u/_timmah_  \n [link]   [comments]",

She did, in some ways. \n I haven’t cried so hard since the night she died. Believe what you will, but I felt like I connected with her through this chat. Bad way to cope? Maybe. But I’m glad I did it. \n What got me, pathetically, is the fact that she kept using ‘old friend’. I did not code that phrase into her personality. But it fit. \n Please read the captions/text on each photo.\n Image 5, since I can’t fit a caption: I did hold her. That night, I slept in the basement where she had to be locked in and I slept with her on her cat bed all night. It’s funny how she said she felt me.\n    submitted by    /u/Flimsy_Wait_8235  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "US DoD AI chief Craig Martell on LLMs: ‘I need hackers to tell us how this stuff breaks’.[1]\n Google and Universal Music are in talks to license artists’ melodies and voices for songs generated by artificial intelligence as the music business tries to monetize one of its biggest threats. The discussions, confirmed by four people familiar with the matter, aim to strike a partnership for an industry that is grappling with the implications of new AI technology.[2]\n New research has found that popular AI tools generated harmful eating disorder content in response to nearly a quarter of 60 prompts. Researchers at the Center for Countering Digital Hate used six popular AI platforms, chatbots, and image generators, including OpenAI’s ChatGPT, Google’s Bard, and SnapChat’s My AI.[3]\n Concerns have been raised about emissions associated with warehouses full of computers powering AI systems. IBM said its prototype could lead to more efficient, less battery draining AI chips for smartphones. Its efficiency is down to components that work in a similar way to connections in human brains, it said.[4]\n  \nSources:\n [1] https://venturebeat.com/ai/us-dod-ai-chief-on-llms-i-need-hackers-to-tell-us-how-this-stuff-breaks/\n [2] https://www.ft.com/content/6f022306-2f83-4da7-8066-51386e8fe63b\n [3] https://www.energyportal.eu/news/how-ai-can-fuel-eating-disorders/162038/\n [4] https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-66465230 \n    submitted by    /u/Excellent-Target-847  \n [link]   [comments]",

This is exactly why you should build your own private & secure chatbot. That may sound difficult, but Mintplex Labs (backed by Y-Combinator) just released AnythingLLM, which gives you the ability to build a chatbot in 10 minutes without code.\n AnythingLLM provides you with the tools to easily build and manage your own private chatbot using API keys. Plus, you can expand your chatbot’s knowledge by importing data such as PDFs, emails, etc. This can be confidential data as only you have access to the database.\n ChatGPT currently allows you to upload PDFs, videos and other data to ChatGPT via vulnerable plug-ins, BUT there is no way to determine if that data is secure or even know where it’s stored.\n Easily build your own business-compliant and secure chatbot at http://useanything.com/. All you need is an OpenAI or Azure OpenAI API key.\n Or, if you prefer using the open source code yourself, here’s the GitHub repo: https://github.com/Mintplex-Labs/anything-llm. \n https://preview.redd.it/r2qf685bf5ib1.png?width=1200&format=png&auto=webp&s=e1fe809338dd5e76c0c82e1fcbd2cf0afe957eb2\n    submitted by    /u/rue_so  \n [link]   [comments]",

If you’re not impressed by this test it’s because it’s showing mostly DaVinci demonstrating variables like order of shapes and yes and no affecting it in a way that wonder was not in the video I posted earlier. I have hours of footage with wonder I just started experimenting with DaVinci…with DaVinci it doesn’t feel like there is a ghost in the machine. Though if there is with Wonder it’s world model seems very narrow. I want to do more tests with DaVinci or try to figure out a concept that if an image generator was able to form a world model, a concept that might be likely to emerge across multiple models.

          "description": "From Anthropic\n https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.03296\n Studying Large Language Model Generalization with Influence Functions\n When trying to gain better visibility into a machine learning model in order to understand and mitigate the associated risks, a potentially valuable source of evidence is: which training examples most contribute to a given behavior? Influence functions aim to answer a counterfactual: how would the model's parameters (and hence its outputs) change if a given sequence were added to the training set? While influence functions have produced insights for small models, they are difficult to scale to large language models (LLMs) due to the difficulty of computing an inverse-Hessian-vector product (IHVP). We use the Eigenvalue-corrected Kronecker-Factored Approximate Curvature (EK-FAC) approximation to scale influence functions up to LLMs with up to 52 billion parameters. In our experiments, EK-FAC achieves similar accuracy to traditional influence function estimators despite the IHVP computation being orders of magnitude faster. We investigate two algorithmic techniques to reduce the cost of computing gradients of candidate training sequences: TF-IDF filtering and query batching. We use influence functions to investigate the generalization patterns of LLMs, including the sparsity of the influence patterns, increasing abstraction with scale, math and programming abilities, cross-lingual generalization, and role-playing behavior. Despite many apparently sophisticated forms of generalization, we identify a surprising limitation: influences decay to near-zero when the order of key phrases is flipped. Overall, influence functions give us a powerful new tool for studying the generalization properties of LLMs.\n    submitted by    /u/DataPhreak  \n [link]   [comments]",

Also noticed with Google and Bing they will give you the same results over and over (I assume I should have used “no repeats”) Google also will show me sold out items or items that aren’t actually on sale. It’ll show the item as say “on sale: $12.00” inspected the link- “$137” actually?? Any filter tips, or other Ai??\n    submitted by    /u/Maelasae  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "If you're creating voice-enabled products, I hope this will help you choose which model to use!\n I read the papers and docs for Bark and Tortoise TTS - two text-to-speech models that seemed pretty similar on the surface but are actually pretty different.\n Here's what Bark can do:\n  \nIt can synthesize natural, human-like speech in multiple languages.\n Bark can also generate music, sound effects, and other audio.\n The model supports generating laughs, sighs, and other non-verbal sounds to make speech more natural and human-sounding. I find these really compelling and these imperfections make the speech sound much more real. Check out an example here (scroll down to \"pizza.webm\").\n Bark allows control over tone, pitch, speaker identity and other attributes through text prompts. \n The model learns directly from text-audio pairs.\n  \nWhereas for Tortoise TTS:\n  \nIt excels at cloning voices using just short audio samples of a target speaker. This makes it easy to produce text in many distinct voices (like celebrities). I think voice cloning is the best use case for this tool.\n The quality of the synthesized voices is pretty high.\n Tortoise supports fine-grained control of speech characteristics like tone, emotion, pacing, etc through priming text.\n Tortoise is only trained on English and it's not capable of producing sound effects.\n  \nHere's how they compare to the other speech-related models I've taken a look at so far:\n  \n Model Best Use Cases Key Strengths \n  \n Bark Voice assistants, audio generation Flexibility, multilingual \n  Tortoise TTS Audiobooks, voice cloning Natural prosody, voice cloning \n  AudioLDM (full guide) Voice assistants High-quality speech and SFX \n  Whisper Transcription Accuracy, flexibility \n  Free VC Voice conversion Retains speech style \n \n I have a full write-up here if you want to read more, it's about a 10-minute read. I also looked at the model inputs and outputs and speculated on some products you can build with each tool.\n    submitted by    /u/Successful-Western27  \n [link]   [comments]",

Please share your thoughts on this idea, and suggest any new features you think I should implement!\n Exciting Features:\n • Speak to Write: with this feature, you can speak your thoughts or information and the tool will transcribe it into text. The best part? You can then forward the transcribed text to any application with just one click.\n • Audio to Action Plan: the service can transform a received audio message into a structured list of elements or bullet points. This feature is especially useful for outlining an action plan or item list.\n • Speak in and Language: you can dictate an audio message in your native language, and the service will translate it into any other language, maintaining high translation quality—significantly better than Google Translate.\n • Meeting Transcripts & Summaries: the service is perfect for converting recorded audio from meetings into text and generating concise summaries. It supports the upload of users' files.\n Thank you for taking the time to check it out. I look forward to hearing your feedback. You can access the service by visiting this link: https://audionotes.ai\n    submitted by    /u/OneMoreSuperUser  \n [link]   [comments]",

I'm sure some people would rather that not being a feature (if they use it at all), but I'd love for it to have some more comedic one-liners, possible news updates, and potentially traffic updates based on location and if it knows you're driving.

But what is important, is that I was an artist before the current \"generative AI\" was a thing, and I have been drawing, digitally and traditionally alike for like... a decade?\n Art, to me, is getting what is inside your head, and presenting it to others outside of your consciousness and thoughts. It's showing the world a piece of your interpretation, your experience, your impressions of the world you inhabit. It's about communicating to others your emotions, your ideas, your thoughts and feelings.\n Not everyone can draw, or paint, or sculpt. I could say \"learn it, it's easy\", but that would be a lie.

This app will use AI to analyse food supplies and assign them purchase priority, value, and complexity scores (maybe just priority if it's too hard). Restaurant owners could then determine what foods should be purchased before others based on the priority scores.\n For example, a restaurant may only have 10 tomatoes left and the average usage of tomatoes in this restaurant is 12 per week. Based on this, a priority would be assigned to purchase x amount of tomatoes.\n Other factors that could be taken into account for the prior…",

Not funny.\n We use the definition of technological singularity. This milestone is predicted to occur after AGI (Artificial General Intelligence) is reached. Please check our definitions and methodology here.\n Predicting the singularity is challenging and uncertain. Current estimates should be viewed cautiously.The estimated date is being continuously updated.\n We ponder a relevant list of curated expert predictions and contributing factors on when the singularity will take place.\n Any suggestion for perfecting the method is highly appreciated.\n    submitted by    /u/Powerful-Pumpkin-938  \n [link]   [comments]",

The guide also explores some example prompts and shows how you can couple it with an upscaler like Real-ESRGAN, GFPGAN, or Codeformer to get even better results.\n My three big takeaways:\n  \nHasdx balances general capabilities with a focus on realism and detail. This makes it well-suited for detailed adult coloring book images.\n The prompt structure gives you precise control over the theme and complexity of the generated illustrations. Negative prompts help avoid undesirable elements (sort of obvious I guess).\n Running Hasdx outputs through upscaling models improves quality for printing. ESRGAN is a good option but there are lots of others that can work well too.\n  \nI also investigated how to modify the prompt to vary the level of complexity in the image, effectively tailoring our model to the skill level of the adult (or child) who happens to be holding the crayons.\n Here's a link to the guide.\n    submitted by    /u/Successful-Western27  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "\"If AGI goes bad, can't we just turn it off?\" \n Personally I feel the best way to address this common talking point is with an analogy. \n Spiders think they could stop all humans if they just withheld all the webs and web making material from us.\n Without those tools, humans couldn't catch flies and surely they'd starve to death? Spiders can't fathom the range of alternate methods for procuring food and thriving.\n Within even a single hour of runtime, a super AGI will likely have diversified away from the human electrical grid in ways we couldn't even imagine. \n The counter argument is, that it would take time to build these pieces together. It after all took us 100 years to get to where we are with the grid. The counter-counter argument however is the AGI doesn't ned to, it can 5D chess us so that all our future actions will fulfil that goal with some slight nudging here and there. \n Fascinating stuff - ultimately though, i'm in the camp of AGI won't happen over night like Frankenstein via a flip of a switch. As AI evolves so do we, gains are incremental with the occasional blips; so whilst this is super fun to talk about, I think the case of us getting blindsided is unlikely. \n I could be wrong...and I probably am.\n    submitted by    /u/kippersniffer  \n [link]   [comments]",

The constant back-and-forth was draining my time and energy.\n So, I took matters into my own hands and developed a Chrome extension that allows you to get an answer from AI without ever leaving the comfort of your current tab, and specifically - the comfort of your current text field. It may seem like a simple solution, but trust me - it's a game-changer when trying to save time and energy.\n Assuming that there's a chance some of you might be experiencing the same frustration, I'd like to share this tool with you.\n For anyone thinking: \"Wait, but there are already tools that let you use AI inside the current browser tab\" - yeah, there are. BUT can they scrape website data from a simple URL in order to get context for the response? Can other tools read PDFs? Do these tools let you control every setting to the smallest detail? Probably not. Well this tool does let you do all that.\n You can find it on Chrome store as \"Wou AI\"\n Let me know how it works out for you, and I would greatly appreciate any feedback or suggestions for future functions.\n    submitted by    /u/MantasDigital  \n [link]   [comments]",

There are lots of premade bots that you can interact with or add to rooms, or you can easily create your own bot using the Make A Bot function. \n For example: I recently made a Friendly English Teacher bot whose sole purpose is to help people learn English. I also made an McDonald Trump bot who WILL NOT REST until he is president and can mandate the consumption of Big Macs for Breakfast, Lunch, and Dinner!\n There will be prizes and initiatives for the most creative bots in the near future. I'd love to see what you come up with!\n Anyway, you can download through the invite link above and dive right in. If you have any thoughts, questions, or comments, please feel free to contact me!

About two months ago I posted here about an anxiety breakdown I've gone through regarding \"AI\", \"Programming\" and how \"human programmers would end\" and stuff like that, which was a major concern for me since programming was my job and my favorite thing to do.\n I was wondering for some time if I was supposed to share an update here. I decided to do so since somebody out there may be feeling the same as me. So I not only have an update but I also want to give some advice to whoever is going through this sh*thole.\n After that post, I talked about my feelings with a lot of people around me (friends and fiancée), and everyone was very supportive. At first I thought they would laugh at me, since there are a lot more to worry to…",

          "description": "I ask this simple question because while we are just now getting to the point that we can create a learning AI, how far are we going to let it go? The more advanced AI becomes the more risks it poses to humanity as a whole, including but not limited to:\n  \nJobs\n How we interact with technology as a whole\n Cars\n Things we can not perceive in this lifetime yet may exist in the future.\n  \nYes, AI is merely a tool... For now.\n But what happens when humanity creates an AI that can think for itself? How long is it going to take that AI to ask the question: \"Why am I listening to you?\" and as humans, our egotistical response will be: \"Because I created you.\"\n I feel that response will spell humanity's doom, because if an AI can do something as complex as human-like thought and come to its own conclusions, what's to stop it from believing it can feel emotion as well? MAYBE IT CAN and it was an unintended side effect or\"bug\" of creating an AI that can truly think for itself. Afterall, we as humans don't even fully understand how human emotion works to begin with.\n The point I'm getting at is, that the farther we advance in AI, the more we risk dooming humanity to a (and I know this sounds silly but bare with me) a terminator-like future except this time we don't have time travel to try and prevent \"judgement day\".\n Or we could merely advance AI to this point and nothing horrible happens but I personally don't like rolling those dice.\n Thoughts?\n    submitted by    /u/deathsia250  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "LDM stands for Latent Diffusion Model. AudioLDM is a novel AI system that uses latent diffusion to generate high-quality speech, sound effects, and music from text prompts. It can either create sounds from just text or use text prompts to guide the manipulation of a supplied audio file. \n I did a deep dive into how AudioLDM works with an eye towards possible startup applications. I think there are a couple of compelling products waiting to be built from this model, all around gaming and text-to-sound (not just text-to-speech... AudioLDM can also create very interesting and weird sound effects).\n From a technical standpoint and from reading the underlying paper, here are the key features I found to be noteworthy.\n  \nUses a Latent Diffusion Model (LDM) to synthesize sound\n Trained in an unsupervised manner on large unlabeled audio datasets (closer to how humans learn about sound, that is, without a corresponding textual explanation)\n Operates in a continuous latent space rather than discrete tokens (smoother)\n Uses Cross-Modal Latent Alignment Pretraining (CLAP) to map text and audio. More details in article.\n Can generate speech, music, and sound effects from text prompts or a combination of a text and an audio prompt\n Allows control over attributes like speaker identity, accent, etc.\n Creates sounds not limited to human speech (e.g. nature sounds)\n  \nThe link to the full write-up is here.\n Check out this video demo from the creator's project website, showing off some of the unique generations the model can create. I liked the upbeat pop music the best, and I also thought the children singing, while creepy, was pretty interesting.\n    submitted by    /u/Successful-Western27  \n [link]   [comments]",

I've been able to implement a network which performs pretty well, getting ~94% accuracy on the test dataset. I read that Cross-Entropy is a better loss function than MSE for categorical classification, so I've been trying to implement that, along with Softmax as an output layer activation function, but I've been met with very underwhelming results.\n I've played around with learning rates, the number of layers and layer sizes, batch sizes, initial values for weights / biases, and nothing seems to help.…",

I consider these more operation research-based techniques. \n However, recently we have obviously seen a lot of progress being made in the machine learning realm for many types of problems. In particular, we've seen neural networks be used to train models based on data in text, audio, or video form. \n I am wondering if we have any idea what the scientific consensus is toward applying these same sort of methods for scheduling problems. Suppose we have a history of schedules that we could train a model on. A schedule isn't really text, audio, or video so I don't understand how one could embed the information in a vector space in the same way that would accurately represent the information (specifically, constraints so that the resulting schedule is still feasible) Is there anyone doing research in this particular area?\n    submitted by    /u/nick898  \n [link]   [comments]",

In such situations, having virtual assistance can be extremely beneficial.\n In this article, I will share my experience of contributing to OpenCV, a renowned open-source library, despite having limited knowledge of C++ and understanding its architecture. I achieved this with the assistance of ChatGPT, a Large Language Model (LLM).\n I hope you can find it interesting.

That is with a simple classifier where every field is a class.\n ​\n I was also thinking of using a Siamese model, where I compare the similarity between them, which allows me to use my more limited dataset more effectively\n ​\n I was wondering if there are any more architectures you guys think I should consider, or will be helpful in solving my problem\n ​\n Thank you for your help!\n    submitted by    /u/eatlantis  \n [link]   [comments]",

Nonetheless, a long standing debate has been whether LLMs can reason symbolically (i.e., manipulating symbols based on logical rules). For example, LLMs are able to perform simple arithmetic operations when numbers are small, but struggle to perform with large numbers. This suggests that LLMs have not learned the underlying rules needed to perform these arithmetic operations. \n\n\n\nWhile neural networks have powerful pattern matching capabilities, they are prone to overfitting to spurious statistical patterns in the data.

The agent is performing well using the tuned hyperparameter when run for 1000 episodes, exceeding the performance of my previous Q-learning agent.\n However, when run for longer iterations it finds the optimal policy but later deviates and converges to a suboptimal policy leading to really poor overall performance.\n I suspect the issue might be the high learning rate of the actor and the low learning rate of the critic. I tried using a basic decay schedule for the actor's learning rate and it seems to improve the stability. However, the performance is lower than the Q-learning agent. \n Why is this happening iyo?

The environment is designed to give positive rewards to actions between some moving limits of the action range, and negative rewards to the actions outside of those limits. For example: \n  \nGlobal action range: (0, 1000)\n Desired action range for first 100k steps: (0, 10)\n Desired action range for 100-200k steps: (30, 40)\n ...\n  \nTherefore, the main challenge of the environment is that actions with positive rewards on certain stage of the environment would return negative rewards on the following stages.\n How should I define the actions of the agent? I've tried the following methods without success:\n  \nSimply scale actions between 0 and 1000 and hope that agents learn the moving distribution of rewards\n Transform actions to percent variations and scale actions over a non-observed moving average (I tried adding the moving average to the observations but the results stayed the same)\n Observations do consider a dimension that serve to differentiate when a distributional shift happens \n Also, I've tried using SAC and DDPPG to model agents\n  \nFeel free to share any comments or suggestions.

Same applies to my problem.\n When I give acceleration as an input to the environment and get the reward as an acceleration itself, my Q-Learning algorithm solves the problem because no system delay included.\n When I give acceleration as an input to the environment and get the reward as an system response to the action, my Q-Learning algorithm cannot solve the problem.\n The Examples Illustrated With Schema \n Upperside is Action and Lower Side is Reward - Delay Mechanism is Applied - You can see that some time is needed to reach the given action input\n Upperside is Action and Lower Side is Reward - Even though Q-Learning tries different actions, reward stays near 0, this prevents learning.\n When you look at the red line, Epsilon-Greedy Algorithm takes random actions at the beginning. When this is the case, reward line has mean of 0, because actions are changing too fast and system response cannot start to settle for specific value.\n To be able to settle for specific value, lets say + 20, it should be given +20 \"consecutively\".

Although the policy gets worse, I would prefer the agent to not forget the best policy so far. \n ​\n I was wondering if I should include the best sequence so far in the batch used for training so that the agent does not forget it. \n ​\n What I am really doing is finding the best parameters to achieve the highest reward. I could use an evolutionary algorithm. Nonetheless, I want my agent to learn patterns of the best sequences for multiple instances of the problem so that it can generalize better.\n ​\n Has anyone read anything about this or has any thoughts on this? Any comment will be greatly appreciated.\n    submitted by    /u/ElvishChampion  \n [link]   [comments]",

It's like I'm making bids every hour and then seeing my total profit or loss at the end of the day.\n The issue is that I only know about my profit or loss after all 24 steps are done. This makes it hard for my agent to learn the order of actions. If I make a mistake in the first 24 steps, it can lead to a big loss at the end. So, my agent struggles to understand what actions to take.\n I'm wondering how I can solve this problem. Since the rewards I get are not frequent and I only find out my profit or loss after 24 steps, should I include the last 24 actions I took as part of the state vector? Or are there other things I can try?

I am putting my understanding and doubts here and would appreciate the help of the community. Let's assume - \n ​\n $y = 10$\n ​\n $\\hat{y} = w_3*z + b$\n ​\n ​\n $z \\sim N(\\mu, \\sigma^2)$\n ​\n $\\mu = w_2*4$\n ​\n $\\sigma = w_1*3$\n ​\n Now, if I had to compute, $de/d{\\mu}$ (e is the error function which is the difference between $y$ and $\\hat{y}$), I wouldn't be able to apply chain rule and compute $dz/d{\\mu}$. This is because z is a sample of the Normal distribution and therefore stochastic with parameters $\\mu$ and $\\sigma$ and therefore changing them based on z might not be a good idea. So, we come up with the following $z$ - \n ​\n $z = \\mu + \\sigma*\\epsilon$ (Apparently $z = \\mu + \\sigma*\\epsilon$ is the same as $z \\sim N(\\mu, \\sigma^2)$)\n ​\n $\\epsilon \\sim N(0,1)$\n ​\n However, I don't see why this $z$ is much different from the previous one. This $z$ is still stochastic, due to the presence of $\\epsilon$.

          "description": "Hi all,\n I started to use Gynasium with stable-baselines 3 for reinforcement learning and I have a basic question. Normally in RL you have a state then you take an action and you get an reward and a new state back in the step function of the gynasium environment.\n In my case things are a little different. The state is always externally given (by reading from a file), then an action is executed in an external environment and a new state is calculated. However, in the next iteration, not the resulting last state used but a new externally given state. \n So my quesiton now is how to handle this using gynsasium and stable-baselines 3? Shall I just return nothing as the state after the action has been executed in the external environment? Or shall I alaways return the resulting state that is however \"overwritten\" in the next iteration.\n    submitted by    /u/PBerit  \n [link]   [comments]",

The issue I'm running into is how to preditct the Q-values for the next state.\n In my map, I decided to change from one state to the next every 5 kills per team. So when that happens the Kill/death ratio of each loadout equipped by a player is updated and used as a reward in the Q-table.\n Well that's the idea, anyway. I wanted to use player kills as a sort of benchmark to gauge performance with a given loadout but I'm afraid the state space I applied is too small and I don't know how to transition from one state to the next and obtain the maximum reward from the expected future rewards of the next state.\n    submitted by    /u/swagonflyyyy  \n [link]   [comments]",

Then, I use Grasshopper3D to analyze the radiation that the interior surfaces and other metrics, that i use for my reward calculation. \n For this, the state of the environment is defined as a 3D Array with 2 channels. One for the Tile Types and one for the rotations. This is processed by a 3D CNN features extractor. \n The thing is that, I just realized that the array that represents the tile types as integers is actually categorical data, and I don't know how well this could work in a CNN.

          "description": "https://imgur.com/WR0Tny9\n My agent needs to learn to take one action in my environment and there are only two possible actions that the agent can take at each time step. The state is just the time step, so every episode has 240 time steps and the agent just needs to learn to take one optimal action out of two possible actions for every time step. I have set this up as simply as I can as a starting point to make sure the algorithm is implemented correctly and that the agent can learn. I am using n-step expected SARSA.\n The bottom plot shows the count for how many times the agent took each action during each episode. The middle plot has the temporal difference error in blue and the \"modelling error\" in orange. The modelling error is the difference between the actual discounted return and the TD target for each time step, summed up for each episode. The red line is the return that the agent would get if it took the optimal action in every time step.\n 0.11, the blue line in the bottom plot, is the optimal action for the agent to take at every time step. The other action will never result in a reward other than 0. So it should be fairly simple for the agent to learn what action to take at every time step and it does learn that at the start. But then, as you can see in the top plot, the agent suddenly starts taking the non-optimal action more often after around episode 450. So I'm just wondering why that would happen. Why would the agent learn to take the optimal action at most time steps and then suddenly decide that it will start taking other actions?\n For more context, the learning rate is 0.6, n is 6, epsilon is decayed by 1/(n_episodes/1.1) every episode so it reaches 0 slightly before the final episode.\n Any ideas based on this information why the agent would decide to start taking the non-optimal action? Or any suggestions for how I could figure out why it would start taking the non-optimal action?\n    submitted by    /u/lifelifebalance  \n [link]   [comments]",

The idea is to learn the action-value function instead of the value function for a policy that we keep improving (using GPI). Once we learn the converged action-value function for all states, the optimal policy is greedily derived from the action-value function (basically take the most promising action at each state).\n In contrast, TD for value estimation is written like this: image. Here we keep the policy fixed and just keep iterating over the multiple episodes, whilst refining the value estimate.\n My question is, why can't we just change TD for value estimation to just greedily update the policy at each stage?

The policy can be simple( like if the target for one side agent is to chase the other side, their policy is directly following the trajectory for their target). The core.py for the petting zoo, it has \n  # return all agents controllable by external policies @property def policy_agents(self): return [agent for agent in self.agents if agent.action_callback is None] # return all agents controlled by world scripts @property def scripted_agents(self): return [agent for agent in self.agents if agent.action_callback is not None] \n But in the step for the environment, it seems the environment directly controls the policy agent. My understanding is scripted agent is RL policy output and the Policy agent can be controlled by other policies. \n My question is :\n if my policy output is the desired position for each timestep, but now the MPE's control dynamic is learned the acceleration's increment, and it's discrete, how can I implement the policy as one side of my competitive case?\n  \nif I can control the policy agent base on policy_agent, how can I step both policy and script agent in env?\n if I can control the agent separately, like my RL output can be discrete but the policy output can be continuous position.\n how to define the termination or truncation for all agents?\n  \n   submitted by    /u/Gloria_1126  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Greetings!\n I'm going through the initial equations that define most of the theoretical framework for the specialization. One curious thing I noticed with equations 3.5 and 3.6 is that they use the conditional distribution p(s′,r∣s,a) without including any priors. I'm talking about priors because, unless I'm missing something huge, the definition of the expected value for the reward (for both 3.5 and 3.6) should use the joint distribution for all 4 dimensions (next state, reward, current state, action). From that joint distribution, we can factorize it to show p(s′,r∣s,a). For example, one factorization that seems to make sense for this kind of model is\n p(s′,r,s,a) = p(s′,r∣s,a) ⋅ p(s) ⋅ p(a)\n which would turn, for example, equation 3.5 into\n r(s,a) = ∑​ ∑ ​r ⋅ p(s′,r∣s,a) ⋅ p(s) ⋅ p(a) (Note: the two sums are for \"r\" and \"s' \". I wrote like that because I don't know write it in Latex or similar...)\n What am I missing? Is it because s and a are given as parameters of the function r(s,a) meaning that p(s) = p(a) = 1?

          "description": "Hello everyone! I'm trying to use reinforcement learning to solve a problem in the power market. The problem is about finding the best strategy for bidding on electricity for each hour of the day, considering both buying and selling options. Let's say we have a generator that can produce up to 800MW of electricity per day, and it can be charged up to 200MW per hour. After charging it for 4 hours continuously, it reaches its maximum capacity, and we can't charge more until we discharge some electricity. We have access to data from the past 5 years, including information about temperature, hydro, gas prices, and locational marginal price, which is important for determining profit. For instance, if we buy 10MW of electricity for a specific hour, our profit for that hour is 10 times the locational marginal price. The goal is to maximize profit at the end of the day while making sure that the total electricity bought and sold is equal for all days. This means we want to avoid wasting electricity. I initially tried using deep Q-learning, where the agent's state consists of data from the past 3 days, and the agent can take actions to buy or sell a certain amount of electricity for one hour. However, this approach doesn't seem to provide accurate results, and it works step by step, not considering the overall outcome for the whole day. So, I'm looking for help on how to build an agent capable of producing 24 bids for 24 hours, considering the constraints of the generator's capacity and ensuring no waste of electricity. I'm new to reinforcement learning, and I'm not sure how to approach this complex problem. Any guidance would be greatly appreciated!\n    submitted by    /u/uonliaquat  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hi all. I (believe) I have a tensorflow NN set up to learn how to intercept a target moving in the x-y plane. Right now, the agent can choose to change its velocity by a small amount in any of the 3 directions (for the 3D case later), then the simulation updates the agents position. The state of the sim is the relative distance and velocity vectors between the target and the pursuer. I am confused how to set up a reward function, however. When I first set it up to be a reward of 1/R (R being the distance magnitude between the target and pursuer) to reward for shorter distances and give less reward for further distances as well as a very large reward when a collision occurred, it seemed like the rewards converged to a small value instead of getting larger. Any advice? I'd be willing to upload a github link as well if you wanted to look at the code\n    submitted by    /u/Happylightsocket  \n [link]   [comments]",
