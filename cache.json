          "description": "Modeling the interaction between proteins and ligands and accurately\npredicting their binding structures is a critical yet challenging task in drug\ndiscovery. Recent advancements in deep learning have shown promise in\naddressing this challenge, with sampling-based and regression-based methods\nemerging as two prominent approaches. However, these methods have notable\nlimitations. Sampling-based methods often suffer from low efficiency due to the\nneed for generating multiple candidate structures for selection. On the other\nhand, regression-based methods offer fast predictions but may experience\ndecreased accuracy. Additionally, the variation in protein sizes often requires\nexternal modules for selecting suitable binding pockets, further impacting\nefficiency. In this work, we propose $\\mathbf{FABind}$, an end-to-end model\nthat combines pocket prediction and docking to achieve accurate and fast\nprotein-ligand binding. $\\mathbf{FABind}$ incorporates a unique ligand-informed\npocket prediction module, which is also leveraged for docking pose estimation.\nThe model further enhances the docking process by incrementally integrating the\npredicted pocket to optimize protein-ligand binding, reducing discrepancies\nbetween training and inference. Through extensive experiments on benchmark\ndatasets, our proposed $\\mathbf{FABind}$ demonstrates strong advantages in\nterms of effectiveness and efficiency compared to existing methods. Our code is\navailable at $\\href{https://github.com/QizhiPei/FABind}{Github}$.",

We propose the GRASP algorithm: Graph Attention\nAccelerated Shortest Path Attack, an ML aided optimization algorithm that\nachieves run times up to 10x faster, while maintaining the quality of solution\ngenerated. GRASP uses a graph attention network to identify a smaller subgraph\ncontaining the combinatorial solution, thus effectively reducing the input\nproblem size. Additionally, we demonstrate how careful representation of the\ninput graph, including node features that correlate well with the optimization\ntask, can highlight important structure in the optimization solution.",

          "description": "The rapid advancements in large language models (LLMs) have ignited interest\nin the temporal knowledge graph (tKG) domain, where conventional carefully\ndesigned embedding-based and rule-based models dominate. The question remains\nopen of whether pre-trained LLMs can understand structured temporal relational\ndata and replace them as the foundation model for temporal relational\nforecasting. Therefore, we bring temporal knowledge forecasting into the\ngenerative setting. However, challenges occur in the huge chasms between\ncomplex temporal graph data structure and sequential natural expressions LLMs\ncan handle, and between the enormous data sizes of tKGs and heavy computation\ncosts of finetuning LLMs. To address these challenges, we propose a novel\nretrieval augmented generation framework that performs generative forecasting\non tKGs named GenTKG, which combines a temporal logical rule-based retrieval\nstrategy and lightweight parameter-efficient instruction tuning. Extensive\nexperiments have shown that GenTKG outperforms conventional methods of temporal\nrelational forecasting under low computation resources. GenTKG also highlights\nremarkable transferability with exceeding performance on unseen datasets\nwithout re-training. Our work reveals the huge potential of LLMs in the tKG\ndomain and opens a new frontier for generative forecasting on tKGs.",

          "description": "Neural operators as novel neural architectures for fast approximating\nsolution operators of partial differential equations (PDEs), have shown\nconsiderable promise for future scientific computing. However, the mainstream\nof training neural operators is still data-driven, which needs an expensive\nground-truth dataset from various sources (e.g., solving PDEs' samples with the\nconventional solvers, real-world experiments) in addition to training stage\ncosts. From a computational perspective, marrying operator learning and\nspecific domain knowledge to solve PDEs is an essential step in reducing\ndataset costs and label-free learning. We propose a novel paradigm that\nprovides a unified framework of training neural operators and solving PDEs with\nthe variational form, which we refer to as the variational operator learning\n(VOL). Ritz and Galerkin approach with finite element discretization are\ndeveloped for VOL to achieve matrix-free approximation of system functional and\nresidual, then direct minimization and iterative update are proposed as two\noptimization strategies for VOL. Various types of experiments based on\nreasonable benchmarks about variable heat source, Darcy flow, and variable\nstiffness elasticity are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of VOL.\nWith a label-free training set and a 5-label-only shift set, VOL learns\nsolution operators with its test errors decreasing in a power law with respect\nto the amount of unlabeled data. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is\nthe first study that integrates the perspectives of the weak form and efficient\niterative methods for solving sparse linear systems into the end-to-end\noperator learning task.",

          "description": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized natural language processing\nand demonstrated impressive capabilities in various tasks. Unfortunately, they\nare prone to hallucinations, where the model exposes incorrect or false\ninformation in its responses, which renders diligent evaluation approaches\nmandatory. While LLM performance in specific knowledge fields is often\nevaluated based on question and answer (Q&A) datasets, such evaluations usually\nreport only a single accuracy number for the dataset, which often covers an\nentire field. This field-based evaluation, is problematic with respect to\ntransparency and model improvement. A stratified evaluation could instead\nreveal subfields, where hallucinations are more likely to occur and thus help\nto better assess LLMs' risks and guide their further development. To support\nsuch stratified evaluations, we propose LLMMaps as a novel visualization\ntechnique that enables users to evaluate LLMs' performance with respect to Q&A\ndatasets. LLMMaps provide detailed insights into LLMs' knowledge capabilities\nin different subfields, by transforming Q&A datasets as well as LLM responses\ninto an internal knowledge structure. An extension for comparative\nvisualization furthermore, allows for the detailed comparison of multiple LLMs.\nTo assess LLMMaps we use them to conduct a comparative analysis of several\nstate-of-the-art LLMs, such as BLOOM, GPT-2, GPT-3, ChatGPT and LLaMa-13B, as\nwell as two qualitative user evaluations.

          "description": "Most packages for the analysis of fMRI-based functional connectivity (FC) and\ngenomic data are used with a programming language interface, lacking an\neasy-to-navigate GUI frontend. This exacerbates two problems found in these\ntypes of data: demographic confounds and quality control in the face of high\ndimensionality of features. The reason is that it is too slow and cumbersome to\nuse a programming interface to create all the necessary visualizations required\nto identify all correlations, confounding effects, or quality control problems\nin a dataset. To remedy this situation, we have developed ImageNomer, a data\nvisualization and analysis tool that allows inspection of both subject-level\nand cohort-level demographic, genomic, and imaging features. The software is\nPython-based, runs in a self-contained Docker image, and contains a\nbrowser-based GUI frontend. We demonstrate the usefulness of ImageNomer by\nidentifying an unexpected race confound when predicting achievement scores in\nthe Philadelphia Neurodevelopmental Cohort (PNC) dataset. In the past, many\nstudies have attempted to use FC to identify achievement-related features in\nfMRI. Using ImageNomer, we find a clear potential for confounding effects of\nrace. Using correlation analysis in the ImageNomer software, we show that FCs\ncorrelated with Wide Range Achievement Test (WRAT) score are in fact more\nhighly correlated with race. Investigating further, we find that whereas both\nFC and SNP (genomic) features can account for 10-15\\% of WRAT score variation,\nthis predictive ability disappears when controlling for race. In this work, we\ndemonstrate the advantage of our ImageNomer GUI tool in data exploration and\nconfound detection. Additionally, this work identifies race as a strong\nconfound in FC data and casts doubt on the possibility of finding unbiased\nachievement-related features in fMRI and SNP data of healthy adolescents.",

          "description": "Generative adversarial networks (GANs) have been extremely successful in\ngenerating samples, from seemingly high dimensional probability measures.\nHowever, these methods struggle to capture the temporal dependence of joint\nprobability distributions induced by time-series data. Furthermore, long\ntime-series data streams hugely increase the dimension of the target space,\nwhich may render generative modelling infeasible. To overcome these challenges,\nmotivated by the autoregressive models in econometric, we are interested in the\nconditional distribution of future time series given the past information. We\npropose the generic conditional Sig-WGAN framework by integrating\nWasserstein-GANs (WGANs) with mathematically principled and efficient path\nfeature extraction called the signature of a path. The signature of a path is a\ngraded sequence of statistics that provides a universal description for a\nstream of data, and its expected value characterises the law of the time-series\nmodel. In particular, we develop the conditional Sig-$W_1$ metric, that\ncaptures the conditional joint law of time series models, and use it as a\ndiscriminator. The signature feature space enables the explicit representation\nof the proposed discriminators which alleviates the need for expensive\ntraining. We validate our method on both synthetic and empirical dataset and\nobserve that our method consistently and significantly outperforms\nstate-of-the-art benchmarks with respect to measures of similarity and\npredictive ability.",

          "description": "We study the problem of future step anticipation in procedural videos. Given\na video of an ongoing procedural activity, we predict a plausible next\nprocedure step described in rich natural language. While most previous work\nfocus on the problem of data scarcity in procedural video datasets, another\ncore challenge of future anticipation is how to account for multiple plausible\nfuture realizations in natural settings. This problem has been largely\noverlooked in previous work. To address this challenge, we frame future step\nprediction as modelling the distribution of all possible candidates for the\nnext step. Specifically, we design a generative model that takes a series of\nvideo clips as input, and generates multiple plausible and diverse candidates\n(in natural language) for the next step. Following previous work, we side-step\nthe video annotation scarcity by pretraining our model on a large text-based\ncorpus of procedural activities, and then transfer the model to the video\ndomain.

          "description": "Graph-structured data is ubiquitous in the world which models complex\nrelationships between objects, enabling various Web applications. Daily\ninfluxes of unlabeled graph data on the Web offer immense potential for these\napplications. Graph self-supervised algorithms have achieved significant\nsuccess in acquiring generic knowledge from abundant unlabeled graph data.\nThese pre-trained models can be applied to various downstream Web applications,\nsaving training time and improving downstream (target) performance. However,\ndifferent graphs, even across seemingly similar domains, can differ\nsignificantly in terms of attribute semantics, posing difficulties, if not\ninfeasibility, for transferring the pre-trained models to downstream tasks.\nConcretely speaking, for example, the additional task-specific node information\nin downstream tasks (specificity) is usually deliberately omitted so that the\npre-trained representation (transferability) can be leveraged. The trade-off as\nsuch is termed as \"transferability-specificity dilemma\" in this work. To\naddress this challenge, we introduce an innovative deployment module coined as\nGraphControl, motivated by ControlNet, to realize better graph domain transfer\nlearning. Specifically, by leveraging universal structural pre-trained models\nand GraphControl, we align the input space across various graphs and\nincorporate unique characteristics of target data as conditional inputs. These\nconditions will be progressively integrated into the model during fine-tuning\nor prompt tuning through ControlNet, facilitating personalized deployment.\nExtensive experiments show that our method significantly enhances the\nadaptability of pre-trained models on target attributed datasets, achieving\n1.4-3x performance gain. Furthermore, it outperforms training-from-scratch\nmethods on target data with a comparable margin and exhibits faster\nconvergence.",

          "description": "Large vision-language models have achieved outstanding performance, but their\nsize and computational requirements make their deployment on\nresource-constrained devices and time-sensitive tasks impractical. Model\ndistillation, the process of creating smaller, faster models that maintain the\nperformance of larger models, is a promising direction towards the solution.\nThis paper investigates the distillation of visual representations in large\nteacher vision-language models into lightweight student models using a small-\nor mid-scale dataset. Notably, this study focuses on open-vocabulary\nout-of-distribution (OOD) generalization, a challenging problem that has been\noverlooked in previous model distillation literature. We propose two principles\nfrom vision and language modality perspectives to enhance student's OOD\ngeneralization: (1) by better imitating teacher's visual representation space,\nand carefully promoting better coherence in vision-language alignment with the\nteacher; (2) by enriching the teacher's language representations with\ninformative and finegrained semantic attributes to effectively distinguish\nbetween different labels. We propose several metrics and conduct extensive\nexperiments to investigate their techniques. The results demonstrate\nsignificant improvements in zero-shot and few-shot student performance on\nopen-vocabulary out-of-distribution classification, highlighting the\neffectiveness of our proposed approaches.

          "description": "Humans often acquire new skills through observation and imitation. For\nrobotic agents, learning from the plethora of unlabeled video demonstration\ndata available on the Internet necessitates imitating the expert without access\nto its action, presenting a challenge known as Imitation Learning from\nObservations (ILfO). A common approach to tackle ILfO problems is to convert\nthem into inverse reinforcement learning problems, utilizing a proxy reward\ncomputed from the agent's and the expert's observations. Nonetheless, we\nidentify that tasks characterized by a progress dependency property pose\nsignificant challenges for such approaches; in these tasks, the agent needs to\ninitially learn the expert's preceding behaviors before mastering the\nsubsequent ones. Our investigation reveals that the main cause is that the\nreward signals assigned to later steps hinder the learning of initial\nbehaviors. To address this challenge, we present a novel ILfO framework that\nenables the agent to master earlier behaviors before advancing to later ones.\nWe introduce an Automatic Discount Scheduling (ADS) mechanism that adaptively\nalters the discount factor in reinforcement learning during the training phase,\nprioritizing earlier rewards initially and gradually engaging later rewards\nonly when the earlier behaviors have been mastered. Our experiments, conducted\non nine Meta-World tasks, demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms\nstate-of-the-art methods across all tasks, including those that are unsolvable\nby them.",

          "description": "Speech conveys more information than text, as the same word can be uttered in\nvarious voices to convey diverse information. Compared to traditional\ntext-to-speech (TTS) methods relying on speech prompts (reference speech) for\nvoice variability, using text prompts (descriptions) is more user-friendly\nsince speech prompts can be hard to find or may not exist at all. TTS\napproaches based on the text prompt face two main challenges: 1) the\none-to-many problem, where not all details about voice variability can be\ndescribed in the text prompt, and 2) the limited availability of text prompt\ndatasets, where vendors and large cost of data labeling are required to write\ntext prompts for speech. In this work, we introduce PromptTTS 2 to address\nthese challenges with a variation network to provide variability information of\nvoice not captured by text prompts, and a prompt generation pipeline to utilize\nthe large language models (LLM) to compose high quality text prompts.\nSpecifically, the variation network predicts the representation extracted from\nthe reference speech (which contains full information about voice variability)\nbased on the text prompt representation. For the prompt generation pipeline, it\ngenerates text prompts for speech with a speech language understanding model to\nrecognize voice attributes (e.g., gender, speed) from speech and a large\nlanguage model to formulate text prompts based on the recognition results.\nExperiments on a large-scale (44K hours) speech dataset demonstrate that\ncompared to the previous works, PromptTTS 2 generates voices more consistent\nwith text prompts and supports the sampling of diverse voice variability,\nthereby offering users more choices on voice generation. Additionally, the\nprompt generation pipeline produces high-quality text prompts, eliminating the\nlarge labeling cost. The demo page of PromptTTS 2 is available online.",

However, the vast\ndisparity in local data distributions among clients, often termed the\nnon-Independent Identically Distributed (non-IID) challenge, poses a\nsignificant hurdle to FL's generalization efficacy. The scenario becomes even\nmore complex when not all clients participate in the training process, a common\noccurrence due to unstable network connections or limited computational\ncapacities. This can greatly complicate the assessment of the trained models'\ngeneralization abilities.

Inspired\nby our deduced generalization bounds, we introduce a weighted aggregation\napproach and a duo of client selection strategies.

          "description": "Federated learning (FL) is a decentralized machine learning approach where\nindependent learners process data privately. Its goal is to create a robust and\naccurate model by aggregating and retraining local models over multiple rounds.\nHowever, FL faces challenges regarding data heterogeneity and model aggregation\neffectiveness. In order to simulate real-world data, researchers use methods\nfor data partitioning that transform a dataset designated for centralized\nlearning into a group of sub-datasets suitable for distributed machine learning\nwith different data heterogeneity. In this paper, we study the currently\npopular data partitioning techniques and visualize their main disadvantages:\nthe lack of precision in the data diversity, which leads to unreliable\nheterogeneity indexes, and the inability to incrementally challenge the FL\nalgorithms. To resolve this problem, we propose a method that leverages entropy\nand symmetry to construct 'the most challenging' and controllable data\ndistributions with gradual difficulty. We introduce a metric to measure data\nheterogeneity among the learning agents and a transformation technique that\ndivides any dataset into splits with precise data diversity. Through a\ncomparative study, we demonstrate the superiority of our method over existing\nFL data partitioning approaches, showcasing its potential to challenge model\naggregation algorithms. Experimental results indicate that our approach\ngradually challenges the FL strategies, and the models trained on FedSym\ndistributions are more distinct.",

          "description": "Generalizable implicit neural representation (INR) enables a single\ncontinuous function, i.e., a coordinate-based neural network, to represent\nmultiple data instances by modulating its weights or intermediate features\nusing latent codes. However, the expressive power of the state-of-the-art\nmodulation is limited due to its inability to localize and capture fine-grained\ndetails of data entities such as specific pixels and rays. To address this\nissue, we propose a novel framework for generalizable INR that combines a\ntransformer encoder with a locality-aware INR decoder. The transformer encoder\npredicts a set of latent tokens from a data instance to encode local\ninformation into each latent token. The locality-aware INR decoder extracts a\nmodulation vector by selectively aggregating the latent tokens via\ncross-attention for a coordinate input and then predicts the output by\nprogressively decoding with coarse-to-fine modulation through multiple\nfrequency bandwidths. The selective token aggregation and the multi-band\nfeature modulation enable us to learn locality-aware representation in spatial\nand spectral aspects, respectively.

          "description": "Recently, contrastive learning has become a key component in fine-tuning code\nsearch models for software development efficiency and effectiveness. It pulls\ntogether positive code snippets while pushing negative samples away given\nsearch queries. Among contrastive learning, InfoNCE is the most widely used\nloss function due to its better performance. However, the following problems in\nnegative samples of InfoNCE may deteriorate its representation learning: 1) The\nexistence of false negative samples in large code corpora due to duplications.\n2). The failure to explicitly differentiate between the potential relevance of\nnegative samples. As an example, a bubble sorting algorithm example is less\n``negative'' than a file saving function for the quick sorting algorithm query.\nIn this paper, we tackle the above problems by proposing a simple yet effective\nSoft-InfoNCE loss that inserts weight terms into InfoNCE. In our proposed loss\nfunction, we apply three methods to estimate the weights of negative pairs and\nshow that the vanilla InfoNCE loss is a special case of Soft-InfoNCE.\nTheoretically, we analyze the effects of Soft-InfoNCE on controlling the\ndistribution of learnt code representations and on deducing a more precise\nmutual information estimation.

However, these\ntechniques often generate heavy artifacts in image reconstruction. One of the\nmost popular refinement methods is to fine-tune the regularization parameter to\nalleviate such artifacts, but it may not always be sufficient or applicable due\nto increased computational costs. In this work, we propose a deep geometric\nincremental learning framework based on the second Nesterov proximal gradient\noptimization. The proposed end-to-end network not only has the powerful\nlearning ability for high-/low-frequency image features, but also can\ntheoretically guarantee that geometric texture details will be reconstructed\nfrom preliminary linear reconstruction. Furthermore, it can avoid the risk of\nintermediate reconstruction results falling outside the geometric decomposition\ndomains and achieve fast convergence. Our reconstruction framework is\ndecomposed into four modules including general linear reconstruction, cascade\ngeometric incremental restoration, Nesterov acceleration, and post-processing.\nIn the image restoration step, a cascade geometric incremental learning module\nis designed to compensate for missing texture information from different\ngeometric spectral decomposition domains. Inspired by the overlap-tile\nstrategy, we also develop a post-processing module to remove the block effect\nin patch-wise-based natural image reconstruction. All parameters in the\nproposed model are learnable, an adaptive initialization technique of physical\nparameters is also employed to make model flexibility and ensure converging\nsmoothly.

          "description": "Foundation models (FM) have demonstrated remarkable performance across a wide\nrange of tasks (especially in the fields of natural language processing and\ncomputer vision), primarily attributed to their ability to comprehend\ninstructions and access extensive, high-quality data. This not only showcases\ntheir current effectiveness but also sets a promising trajectory towards the\ndevelopment of artificial general intelligence. Unfortunately, due to multiple\nconstraints, the raw data of the model used for large model training are often\ninaccessible, so the use of end-to-end models for downstream tasks has become a\nnew research trend, which we call Learn From Model (LFM) in this article. LFM\nfocuses on the research, modification, and design of FM based on the model\ninterface, so as to better understand the model structure and weights (in a\nblack box environment), and to generalize the model to downstream tasks. The\nstudy of LFM techniques can be broadly categorized into five major areas: model\ntuning, model distillation, model reuse, meta learning and model editing. Each\ncategory encompasses a repertoire of methods and strategies that aim to enhance\nthe capabilities and performance of FM. This paper gives a comprehensive review\nof the current methods based on FM from the perspective of LFM, in order to\nhelp readers better understand the current research status and ideas. To\nconclude, we summarize the survey by highlighting several critical areas for\nfuture exploration and addressing open issues that require further attention\nfrom the research community.

          "description": "Many evolutionary algorithms (EAs) take advantage of parallel evaluation of\ncandidates. However, if evaluation times vary significantly, many worker nodes\n(i.e.,\\ compute clients) are idle much of the time, waiting for the next\ngeneration to be created. Evolutionary neural architecture search (ENAS), a\nclass of EAs that optimizes the architecture and hyperparameters of deep neural\nnetworks, is particularly vulnerable to this issue. This paper proposes a\ngeneric asynchronous evaluation strategy (AES) that is then adapted to work\nwith ENAS. AES increases throughput by maintaining a queue of up to $K$\nindividuals ready to be sent to the workers for evaluation and proceeding to\nthe next generation as soon as $M<<K$ individuals have been evaluated. A\nsuitable value for $M$ is determined experimentally, balancing diversity and\nefficiency. To showcase the generality and power of AES, it was first evaluated\nin eight-line sorting network design (a single-population optimization task\nwith limited evaluation-time variability), achieving an over two-fold speedup.\nNext, it was evaluated in 11-bit multiplexer design (a single-population\ndiscovery task with extended variability), where a 14-fold speedup was\nobserved. It was then scaled up to ENAS for image captioning (a\nmulti-population open-ended-optimization task), resulting in an over two-fold\nspeedup. In all problems, a multifold performance improvement was observed,\nsuggesting that AES is a promising method for parallelizing the evolution of\ncomplex systems with long and variable evaluation times, such as those in ENAS.",

          "description": "Prompt tuning (PT), where a small amount of trainable soft (continuous)\nprompt vectors is affixed to the input of language models (LM), has shown\npromising results across various tasks and models for parameter-efficient\nfine-tuning (PEFT). PT stands out from other PEFT approaches because it\nmaintains competitive performance with fewer trainable parameters and does not\ndrastically scale up its parameters as the model size expands. However, PT\nintroduces additional soft prompt tokens, leading to longer input sequences,\nwhich significantly impacts training and inference time and memory usage due to\nthe Transformer's quadratic complexity. Particularly concerning for Large\nLanguage Models (LLMs) that face heavy daily querying. To address this issue,\nwe propose Decomposed Prompt Tuning (DePT), which decomposes the soft prompt\ninto a shorter soft prompt and a pair of low-rank matrices that are then\noptimised with two different learning rates. This allows DePT to achieve better\nperformance while saving over 20% memory and time costs compared to vanilla PT\nand its variants, without changing trainable parameter sizes. Through extensive\nexperiments on 23 natural language processing (NLP) and vision-language (VL)\ntasks, we demonstrate that DePT outperforms state-of-the-art PEFT approaches,\nincluding the full fine-tuning baseline in some scenarios. Additionally, we\nempirically show that DEPT grows more efficient as the model size increases.\nOur further study reveals that DePT integrates seamlessly with\nparameter-efficient transfer learning in the few-shot learning setting and\nhighlights its adaptability to various model architectures and sizes.",

To understand this phenomenon, many works have aimed to quantify\nthe memorization capacity of a neural network architecture: the largest number\nof points such that the architecture can interpolate any placement of these\npoints with any assignment of labels. For real-world data, however, one\nintuitively expects the presence of a benign structure so that interpolation\nalready occurs at a smaller network size than suggested by memorization\ncapacity. In this paper, we investigate interpolation by adopting an\ninstance-specific viewpoint. We introduce a simple randomized algorithm that,\ngiven a fixed finite dataset with two classes, with high probability constructs\nan interpolating three-layer neural network in polynomial time. The required\nnumber of parameters is linked to geometric properties of the two classes and\ntheir mutual arrangement. As a result, we obtain guarantees that are\nindependent of the number of samples and hence move beyond worst-case\nmemorization capacity bounds.

          "description": "A recent empirical observation (Li et al., 2022b) of activation sparsity in\nMLP blocks offers an opportunity to drastically reduce computation costs for\nfree. Although having attributed it to training dynamics, existing theoretical\nexplanations of activation sparsity are restricted to shallow networks, small\ntraining steps and special training, despite its emergence in deep models\nstandardly trained for a large number of steps. To fill these gaps, we propose\nthe notion of gradient sparsity as one source of activation sparsity and a\ntheoretical explanation based on it that sees sparsity a necessary step to\nadversarial robustness w.r.t. hidden features and parameters, which is\napproximately the flatness of minima for well-learned models. The theory\napplies to standardly trained LayerNorm-ed MLPs, and further to Transformers or\nother architectures trained with weight noises. Eliminating other sources of\nflatness except for sparsity, we discover the phenomenon that the ratio between\nthe largest and smallest non-zero singular values of weight matrices is small.\nWhen discussing the emergence of this spectral concentration, we use random\nmatrix theory (RMT) as a powerful tool to analyze stochastic gradient noises.\nValidational experiments are conducted to verify our gradient-sparsity-based\nexplanation. We propose two plug-and-play modules for both training and\nfinetuning for sparsity.

          "description": "This work identifies a simple pre-training mechanism that leads to\nrepresentations exhibiting better continual and transfer learning. This\nmechanism -- the repeated resetting of weights in the last layer, which we\nnickname \"zapping\" -- was originally designed for a meta-continual-learning\nprocedure, yet we show it is surprisingly applicable in many settings beyond\nboth meta-learning and continual learning. In our experiments, we wish to\ntransfer a pre-trained image classifier to a new set of classes, in a few\nshots. We show that our zapping procedure results in improved transfer accuracy\nand/or more rapid adaptation in both standard fine-tuning and continual\nlearning settings, while being simple to implement and computationally\nefficient. In many cases, we achieve performance on par with state of the art\nmeta-learning without needing the expensive higher-order gradients, by using a\ncombination of zapping and sequential learning. An intuitive explanation for\nthe effectiveness of this zapping procedure is that representations trained\nwith repeated zapping learn features that are capable of rapidly adapting to\nnewly initialized classifiers. Such an approach may be considered a\ncomputationally cheaper type of, or alternative to, meta-learning rapidly\nadaptable features with higher-order gradients. This adds to recent work on the\nusefulness of resetting neural network parameters during training, and invites\nfurther investigation of this mechanism.",

          "description": "We propose to replace vector quantization (VQ) in the latent representation\nof VQ-VAEs with a simple scheme termed finite scalar quantization (FSQ), where\nwe project the VAE representation down to a few dimensions (typically less than\n10). Each dimension is quantized to a small set of fixed values, leading to an\n(implicit) codebook given by the product of these sets. By appropriately\nchoosing the number of dimensions and values each dimension can take, we obtain\nthe same codebook size as in VQ. On top of such discrete representations, we\ncan train the same models that have been trained on VQ-VAE representations. For\nexample, autoregressive and masked transformer models for image generation,\nmultimodal generation, and dense prediction computer vision tasks. Concretely,\nwe employ FSQ with MaskGIT for image generation, and with UViM for depth\nestimation, colorization, and panoptic segmentation. Despite the much simpler\ndesign of FSQ, we obtain competitive performance in all these tasks. We\nemphasize that FSQ does not suffer from codebook collapse and does not need the\ncomplex machinery employed in VQ (commitment losses, codebook reseeding, code\nsplitting, entropy penalties, etc.) to learn expressive discrete\nrepresentations.",

          "description": "Diffusion models have shown remarkable performance on many generative tasks.\nDespite recent success, most diffusion models are restricted in that they only\nallow linear transformation of the data distribution. In contrast, broader\nfamily of transformations can potentially help train generative distributions\nmore efficiently, simplifying the reverse process and closing the gap between\nthe true negative log-likelihood and the variational approximation. In this\npaper, we present Neural Diffusion Models (NDMs), a generalization of\nconventional diffusion models that enables defining and learning time-dependent\nnon-linear transformations of data. We show how to optimise NDMs using a\nvariational bound in a simulation-free setting. Moreover, we derive a\ntime-continuous formulation of NDMs, which allows fast and reliable inference\nusing off-the-shelf numerical ODE and SDE solvers. Finally, we demonstrate the\nutility of NDMs with learnable transformations through experiments on standard\nimage generation benchmarks, including CIFAR-10, downsampled versions of\nImageNet and CelebA-HQ. NDMs outperform conventional diffusion models in terms\nof likelihood and produce high-quality samples.",

          "description": "Counterfactual Regret Minimization (CFR) and its variants are the best\nalgorithms so far for solving large-scale incomplete information games.\nHowever, we believe that there are two problems with CFR: First, matrix\nmultiplication is required in CFR iteration, and the time complexity of one\niteration is too high; Secondly, the game characteristics in the real world are\ndifferent. Just using one CFR algorithm will not be perfectly suitable for all\ngame problems.\n\nFor these two problems, this paper proposes a new algorithm called Pure CFR\n(PCFR) based on CFR. PCFR can be seen as a combination of CFR and Fictitious\nPlay (FP), inheriting the concept of counterfactual regret (value) from CFR,\nand using the best response strategy instead of the regret matching strategy\nfor the next iteration. This algorithm has three advantages. First, PCFR can be\ncombined with any CFR variant. The resulting Pure MCCFR (PMCCFR) can\nsignificantly reduce the time and space complexity of one iteration. Secondly,\nour experiments show that the convergence speed of the PMCCFR is 2$\\sim$3 times\nthat of the MCCFR. Finally, there is a type of game that is very suitable for\nPCFR, we call this type of game clear-game, which is characterized by a high\nproportion of dominated strategies.

Recent\nworks have reported success in solving these problems individually. There have\nalso been impressive engineering efforts towards solving all three for\nreal-time strategy games. However, applying DRL to the full ACO problem remains\nan open challenge. Here, we survey the relevant DRL literature and\nconceptualize an idealised ACO-DRL agent. We provide: i.) A summary of the\ndomain properties that define the ACO problem; ii.) A comprehensive evaluation\nof the extent to which domains used for benchmarking DRL approaches are\ncomparable to ACO; iii.)

The\nsecond level has the teacher probabilities of sampled labels available in\naddition, which turns out to boost the convergence rate lower bound to\n${{|{\\mathcal S}||{\\mathcal A}|}/{n}}$.

          "description": "Offline policy learning is aimed at learning decision-making policies using\nexisting datasets of trajectories without collecting additional data. The\nprimary motivation for using reinforcement learning (RL) instead of supervised\nlearning techniques such as behavior cloning is to find a policy that achieves\na higher average return than the trajectories constituting the dataset.\nHowever, we empirically find that when a dataset is dominated by suboptimal\ntrajectories, state-of-the-art offline RL algorithms do not substantially\nimprove over the average return of trajectories in the dataset. We argue this\nis due to an assumption made by current offline RL algorithms of staying close\nto the trajectories in the dataset. If the dataset primarily consists of\nsub-optimal trajectories, this assumption forces the policy to mimic the\nsuboptimal actions. We overcome this issue by proposing a sampling strategy\nthat enables the policy to only be constrained to ``good data\" rather than all\nactions in the dataset (i.e., uniform sampling). We present a realization of\nthe sampling strategy and an algorithm that can be used as a plug-and-play\nmodule in standard offline RL algorithms.

In this paper, we\nprovide a rigorous theoretical analysis of an existing empirically successful\noffline GCRL algorithm. We prove that under slight modification, this algorithm\nenjoys an $\\widetilde{O}(\\text{poly}(1/\\epsilon))$ sample complexity (where\n$\\epsilon$ is the desired suboptimality of the learned policy) with general\nfunction approximation thanks to the property of (semi-)strong convexity of the\nobjective functions.

We also empirically\nvalidate our theory by showing that the modified algorithm outperforms the\nprevious algorithm in various real-world environments.

          "description": "We propose a time series forecasting method named Quantum Gramian Angular\nField (QGAF). This approach merges the advantages of quantum computing\ntechnology with deep learning, aiming to enhance the precision of time series\nclassification and forecasting. We successfully transformed stock return time\nseries data into two-dimensional images suitable for Convolutional Neural\nNetwork (CNN) training by designing specific quantum circuits. Distinct from\nthe classical Gramian Angular Field (GAF) approach, QGAF's uniqueness lies in\neliminating the need for data normalization and inverse cosine calculations,\nsimplifying the transformation process from time series data to two-dimensional\nimages. To validate the effectiveness of this method, we conducted experiments\non datasets from three major stock markets: the China A-share market, the Hong\nKong stock market, and the US stock market. Experimental results revealed that\ncompared to the classical GAF method, the QGAF approach significantly improved\ntime series prediction accuracy, reducing prediction errors by an average of\n25% for Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and 48% for Mean Squared Error (MSE). This\nresearch confirms the potential and promising prospects of integrating quantum\ncomputing with deep learning techniques in financial time series forecasting.",

          "description": "Interpretable policy learning seeks to estimate intelligible decision\npolicies from observed actions; however, existing models fall short by forcing\na tradeoff between accuracy and interpretability. This tradeoff limits\ndata-driven interpretations of human decision-making process. e.g. to audit\nmedical decisions for biases and suboptimal practices, we require models of\ndecision processes which provide concise descriptions of complex behaviors.\nFundamentally, existing approaches are burdened by this tradeoff because they\nrepresent the underlying decision process as a universal policy, when in fact\nhuman decisions are dynamic and can change drastically with contextual\ninformation. Thus, we propose Contextualized Policy Recovery (CPR), which\nre-frames the problem of modeling complex decision processes as a multi-task\nlearning problem in which complex decision policies are comprised of\ncontext-specific policies. CPR models each context-specific policy as a linear\nobservation-to-action mapping, and generates new decision models\n$\\textit{on-demand}$ as contexts are updated with new observations. CPR is\ncompatible with fully offline and partially observable decision environments,\nand can be tailored to incorporate any recurrent black-box model or\ninterpretable decision model. We assess CPR through studies on simulated and\nreal data, achieving state-of-the-art performance on the canonical tasks of\npredicting antibiotic prescription in intensive care units ($+22\\%$ AUROC vs.\nprevious SOTA) and predicting MRI prescription for Alzheimer's patients\n($+7.7\\%$ AUROC vs. previous SOTA). With this improvement in predictive\nperformance, CPR closes the accuracy gap between interpretable and black-box\nmethods for policy learning, allowing high-resolution exploration and analysis\nof context-specific decision models.",

To embed scalar values that may\npossess arbitrary numerical scales to high-dimensional vectors, we propose a\nnumerically multi-scaled embedding module enumerating all possible scales for\nthe scalar values. The model undergoes pretraining using the proposed\nnumerically multi-scaled embedding with a simple contrastive objective on a\nlarge-scale dataset containing over a million sequences.

MMTSA first transforms IMU sensor data into a\ntemporal and structure-preserving gray-scale image using the Gramian Angular\nField (GAF), representing the inherent properties of human activities. MMTSA\nthen applies a multimodal sparse sampling method to reduce data redundancy.\nLastly, MMTSA adopts an inter-segment attention module for efficient multimodal\nfusion. Using three well-established public datasets, we evaluated MMTSA's\neffectiveness and efficiency in HAR.

This paper focuses on tree detection\nmethods applied to UAV data collected by UAVs. There are two kinds of data, the\npoint cloud and the images, which are acquired by the Light Detection and\nRanging (LiDAR) sensor and camera, respectively. Among the detection methods\nusing point-cloud data, this paper mainly classifies these methods according to\nLiDAR and Digital Aerial Photography (DAP). For the detection methods using\nimages directly, this paper reviews these methods by whether or not to use the\nDeep Learning (DL) method. Our review concludes and analyses the comparison and\ncombination between the application of LiDAR-based and DAP-based point cloud\ndata. The performance, relative merits, and application fields of the methods\nare also introduced. Meanwhile, this review counts the number of tree detection\nstudies using different methods in recent years. From our statics, the\ndetection task using DL methods on the image has become a mainstream trend as\nthe number of DL-based detection researches increases to 45% of the total\nnumber of tree detection studies up to 2022.

          "description": "Training machine learning models robust to distribution shifts is critical\nfor real-world applications. Some robust training algorithms (e.g., Group DRO)\nspecialize to group shifts and require group information on all training\npoints. Other methods (e.g., CVaR DRO) that do not need group annotations can\nbe overly conservative, since they naively upweight high loss points which may\nform a contrived set that does not correspond to any meaningful group in the\nreal world (e.g., when the high loss points are randomly mislabeled training\npoints). In this work, we address limitations in prior approaches by assuming a\nmore nuanced form of group shift: conditioned on the label, we assume that the\ntrue group function (indicator over group) is simple. For example, we may\nexpect that group shifts occur along low bitrate features (e.g., image\nbackground, lighting). Thus, we aim to learn a model that maintains high\naccuracy on simple group functions realized by these low bitrate features, that\nneed not spend valuable model capacity achieving high accuracy on contrived\ngroups of examples. Based on this, we consider the two-player game formulation\nof DRO where the adversary's capacity is bitrate-constrained. Our resulting\npractical algorithm, Bitrate-Constrained DRO (BR-DRO), does not require group\ninformation on training samples yet matches the performance of Group DRO on\ndatasets that have training group annotations and that of CVaR DRO on\nlong-tailed distributions. Our theoretical analysis reveals that in some\nsettings BR-DRO objective can provably yield statistically efficient and less\nconservative solutions than unconstrained CVaR DRO.",

          "description": "A flow control system is a critical concept for increasing the production\ncapacity of manufacturing systems. To solve the scheduling optimization problem\nrelated to the flow control with the aim of improving productivity, existing\nmethods depend on a heuristic design by domain human experts. Therefore, the\nmethods require correction, monitoring, and verification by using real\nequipment. As system designs increase in complexity, the monitoring time\nincreases, which decreases the probability of arriving at the optimal design.\nAs an alternative approach to the heuristic design of flow control systems, the\nuse of deep reinforcement learning to solve the scheduling optimization problem\nhas been considered. Although the existing research on reinforcement learning\nhas yielded excellent performance in some areas, the applicability of the\nresults to actual FAB such as display and semiconductor manufacturing processes\nis not evident so far. To this end, we propose a method to implement a physical\nsimulation environment and devise a feasible flow control system design using a\ntransfer robot in display manufacturing through reinforcement learning. We\npresent a model and parameter setting to build a virtual environment for\ndifferent display transfer robots, and training methods of reinforcement\nlearning on the environment to obtain an optimal scheduling of glass flow\ncontrol systems. Its feasibility was verified by using different types of\nrobots used in the actual process.",

          "description": "Riemannian geometry provides us with powerful tools to explore the latent\nspace of generative models while preserving the underlying structure of the\ndata. The latent space can be equipped it with a Riemannian metric, pulled back\nfrom the data manifold. With this metric, we can systematically navigate the\nspace relying on geodesics defined as the shortest curves between two points.\nGenerative models are often stochastic, causing the data space, the Riemannian\nmetric, and the geodesics, to be stochastic as well. Stochastic objects are at\nbest impractical, and at worst impossible, to manipulate. A common solution is\nto approximate the stochastic pullback metric by its expectation. But the\ngeodesics derived from this expected Riemannian metric do not correspond to the\nexpected length-minimising curves. In this work, we propose another metric\nwhose geodesics explicitly minimise the expected length of the pullback metric.\nWe show this metric defines a Finsler metric, and we compare it with the\nexpected Riemannian metric. In high dimensions, we prove that both metrics\nconverge to each other at a rate of $O\\left(\\frac{1}{D}\\right)$. This\nconvergence implies that the established expected Riemannian metric is an\naccurate approximation of the theoretically more grounded Finsler metric. This\nprovides justification for using the expected Riemannian metric for practical\nimplementations.",

However, existing theoretical\nresults have shown that learning in general POMDPs could be intractable, where\nthe main challenge lies in the lack of latent state information. A key\nfundamental question here is how much online state information (OSI) is\nsufficient to achieve tractability. In this paper, we establish a lower bound\nthat reveals a surprising hardness result: unless we have full OSI, we need an\nexponentially scaling sample complexity to obtain an $\\epsilon$-optimal policy\nsolution for POMDPs. Nonetheless, inspired by the key insights in our lower\nbound design, we find that there exist important tractable classes of POMDPs\neven with only partial OSI.

          "description": "In his breakthrough paper, Raz showed that any parity learning algorithm\nrequires either quadratic memory or an exponential number of samples [FOCS'16,\nJACM'19]. A line of work that followed extended this result to a large class of\nlearning problems. Until recently, all these results considered learning in the\nstreaming model, where each sample is drawn independently, and the learner is\nallowed a single pass over the stream of samples. Garg, Raz, and Tal [CCC'19]\nconsidered a stronger model, allowing multiple passes over the stream. In the\n$2$-pass model, they showed that learning parities of size $n$ requires either\na memory of size $n^{1.5}$ or at least $2^{\\sqrt{n}}$ samples. (Their result\nalso generalizes to other learning problems.)\n\nIn this work, for any constant $q$, we prove tight memory-sample lower bounds\nfor any parity learning algorithm that makes $q$ passes over the stream of\nsamples. We show that such a learner requires either $\\Omega(n^{2})$ memory\nsize or at least $2^{\\Omega(n)}$ samples. Beyond establishing a tight lower\nbound, this is the first non-trivial lower bound for $q$-pass learning for any\n$q\\ge 3$. Similar to prior work, our results extend to any learning problem\nwith many nearly-orthogonal concepts.\n\nWe complement the lower bound with an upper bound, showing that parity\nlearning with $q$ passes can be done efficiently with $O(n^2/\\log q)$ memory.",

          "description": "Secure inference of deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) under RNS-CKKS\ninvolves polynomial approximation of unsupported non-linear activation\nfunctions. However, existing approaches have three main limitations: 1)\nInflexibility: The polynomial approximation and associated homomorphic\nevaluation architecture are customized manually for each CNN architecture and\ndo not generalize to other networks. 2) Suboptimal Approximation: Each\nactivation function is approximated instead of the function represented by the\nCNN. 3) Restricted Design: Either high-degree or low-degree polynomial\napproximations are used. The former retains high accuracy but slows down\ninference due to bootstrapping operations, while the latter accelerates\nciphertext inference but compromises accuracy. To address these limitations, we\npresent AutoFHE, which automatically adapts standard CNNs for secure inference\nunder RNS-CKKS. The key idea is to adopt layerwise mixed-degree polynomial\nactivation functions, which are optimized jointly with the homomorphic\nevaluation architecture in terms of the placement of bootstrapping operations.\nThe problem is modeled within a multi-objective optimization framework to\nmaximize accuracy and minimize the number of bootstrapping operations. AutoFHE\ncan be applied flexibly on any CNN architecture, and it provides diverse\nsolutions that span the trade-off between accuracy and latency. Experimental\nevaluation over RNS-CKKS encrypted CIFAR datasets shows that AutoFHE\naccelerates secure inference by $1.32\\times$ to $1.8\\times$ compared to methods\nemploying high-degree polynomials. It also improves accuracy by up to 2.56%\ncompared to methods using low-degree polynomials. Lastly, AutoFHE accelerates\ninference and improves accuracy by $103\\times$ and 3.46%, respectively,\ncompared to CNNs under TFHE.",

          "description": "Incomplete knowledge of the environment leads an agent to make decisions\nunder uncertainty. One of the major dilemmas in Reinforcement Learning (RL)\nwhere an autonomous agent has to balance two contrasting needs in making its\ndecisions is: exploiting the current knowledge of the environment to maximize\nthe cumulative reward as well as exploring actions that allow improving the\nknowledge of the environment, hopefully leading to higher reward values\n(exploration-exploitation trade-off). Concurrently, another relevant issue\nregards the full observability of the states, which may not be assumed in all\napplications. Such as when only 2D images are considered as input in a RL\napproach used for finding the optimal action within a 3D simulation\nenvironment. In this work, we address these issues by deploying and testing\nseveral techniques to balance exploration and exploitation trade-off on\npartially observable systems for predicting steering wheels in autonomous\ndriving scenario. More precisely, the final aim is to investigate the effects\nof using both stochastic and deterministic multi-armed bandit strategies\ncoupled with a Deep Recurrent Q-Network. Additionally, we adapted and evaluated\nthe impact of an innovative method to improve the learning phase of the\nunderlying Convolutional Recurrent Neural Network. We aim to show that adaptive\nstochastic methods for exploration better approximate the trade-off between\nexploration and exploitation as, in general, Softmax and Max-Boltzmann\nstrategies are able to outperform epsilon-greedy techniques.",

The controller ensures stable walking, and the force estimator\nenables the robot to respond to the external forces from the human.

          "description": "Different conflicting optimization criteria arise naturally in various Deep\nLearning scenarios. These can address different main tasks (i.e., in the\nsetting of Multi-Task Learning), but also main and secondary tasks such as loss\nminimization versus sparsity. The usual approach is a simple weighting of the\ncriteria, which formally only works in the convex setting. In this paper, we\npresent a Multi-Objective Optimization algorithm using a modified Weighted\nChebyshev scalarization for training Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) with respect\nto several tasks. By employing this scalarization technique, the algorithm can\nidentify all optimal solutions of the original problem while reducing its\ncomplexity to a sequence of single-objective problems. The simplified problems\nare then solved using an Augmented Lagrangian method, enabling the use of\npopular optimization techniques such as Adam and Stochastic Gradient Descent,\nwhile efficaciously handling constraints. Our work aims to address the\n(economical and also ecological) sustainability issue of DNN models, with a\nparticular focus on Deep Multi-Task models, which are typically designed with a\nvery large number of weights to perform equally well on multiple tasks. Through\nexperiments conducted on two Machine Learning datasets, we demonstrate the\npossibility of adaptively sparsifying the model during training without\nsignificantly impacting its performance, if we are willing to apply\ntask-specific adaptations to the network weights.

          "description": "In continual learning, the learner learns multiple tasks in sequence, with\ndata being acquired only once for each task. Catastrophic forgetting is a major\nchallenge to continual learning. To reduce forgetting, some existing\nrehearsal-based methods use episodic memory to replay samples of previous\ntasks. However, in the process of knowledge integration when learning a new\ntask, this strategy also suffers from catastrophic forgetting due to an\nimbalance between old and new knowledge. To address this problem, we propose a\nnovel replay strategy called Manifold Expansion Replay (MaER). We argue that\nexpanding the implicit manifold of the knowledge representation in the episodic\nmemory helps to improve the robustness and expressiveness of the model. To this\nend, we propose a greedy strategy to keep increasing the diameter of the\nimplicit manifold represented by the knowledge in the buffer during memory\nmanagement. In addition, we introduce Wasserstein distance instead of cross\nentropy as distillation loss to preserve previous knowledge. With extensive\nexperimental validation on MNIST, CIFAR10, CIFAR100, and TinyImageNet, we show\nthat the proposed method significantly improves the accuracy in continual\nlearning setup, outperforming the state of the arts.",

          "description": "To solve complex tasks, large language models (LLMs) often require multiple\nrounds of interactions with the user, sometimes assisted by external tools.\nHowever, current evaluation protocols often emphasize benchmark performance\nwith single-turn exchanges, neglecting the nuanced interactions among the user,\nLLMs, and external tools, while also underestimating the importance of natural\nlanguage feedback from users. These oversights contribute to discrepancies\nbetween research benchmark evaluations and real-world use cases. We introduce\nMINT, a benchmark that evaluates LLMs' ability to solve tasks with multi-turn\ninteractions by (1) using tools and (2) leveraging natural language feedback.\nTo ensure reproducibility, we provide an evaluation framework where LLMs can\naccess tools by executing Python code and receive users' natural language\nfeedback simulated by GPT-4. We repurpose a diverse set of established\nevaluation datasets focusing on reasoning, coding, and decision-making and\ncarefully curate them into a compact subset for efficient evaluation. Our\nanalysis of 20 open- and closed-source LLMs offers intriguing findings. (a)\nLLMs generally benefit from tools and language feedback, with performance gains\n(absolute, same below) of 1-8% for each turn of tool use and 2-17% with natural\nlanguage feedback. (b) Better single-turn performance does not guarantee better\nmulti-turn performance. (c) Surprisingly, on the LLMs evaluated, supervised\ninstruction-finetuning (SIFT) and reinforcement learning from human feedback\n(RLHF) generally hurt multi-turn capabilities. We expect MINT can help measure\nprogress and incentivize research in improving LLMs' capabilities in multi-turn\ninteractions, especially for open-source communities where multi-turn human\nevaluation can be less accessible compared to commercial LLMs with a larger\nuser base.",

          "description": "Exploring variations of 3D shapes is a time-consuming process in traditional\n3D modeling tools. Deep generative models of 3D shapes often feature continuous\nlatent spaces that can, in principle, be used to explore potential variations\nstarting from a set of input shapes. In practice, doing so can be problematic:\nlatent spaces are high dimensional and hard to visualize, contain shapes that\nare not relevant to the input shapes, and linear paths through them often lead\nto sub-optimal shape transitions. Furthermore, one would ideally be able to\nexplore variations in the original high-quality meshes used to train the\ngenerative model, not its lower-quality output geometry. In this paper, we\npresent a method to explore variations among a given set of landmark shapes by\nconstructing a mapping from an easily-navigable 2D exploration space to a\nsubspace of a pre-trained generative model. We first describe how to find a\nmapping that spans the set of input landmark shapes and exhibits smooth\nvariations between them. We then show how to turn the variations in this\nsubspace into deformation fields, to transfer those variations to high-quality\nmeshes for the landmark shapes. Our results show that our method can produce\nvisually-pleasing and easily-navigable 2D exploration spaces for several\ndifferent shape categories, especially as compared to prior work on learning\ndeformation spaces for 3D shapes.",

This motivated prior works on\nvariance-adaptive frequentist algorithms, which have strong instance-dependent\nregret bounds but cannot incorporate prior knowledge on reward variances. We\nlay foundations for the Bayesian setting, which incorporates prior knowledge.\nThis results in lower regret in practice, due to using the prior in the\nalgorithm design, and also improved regret guarantees.

To this end, recent work has\nproposed several algorithms which approximate the removal of training data\nwithout retraining the model. These algorithms crucially rely on access to the\nmodel parameters in order to update them, an assumption that may not hold in\npractice due to computational constraints or when the LLM is accessed via API.\nIn this work, we propose a new class of unlearning methods for LLMs we call\n''In-Context Unlearning'', providing inputs in context and without having to\nupdate model parameters. To unlearn a particular training instance, we provide\nthe instance alongside a flipped label and additional correctly labelled\ninstances which are prepended as inputs to the LLM at inference time. Our\nexperimental results demonstrate that these contexts effectively remove\nspecific information from the training set while maintaining performance levels\nthat are competitive with (or in some cases exceed) state-of-the-art unlearning\nmethods that require access to the LLM parameters.",

          "description": "We present a lifelong audio-video masked autoencoder that continually learns\nthe multimodal representations from a video stream containing audio-video\npairs, while its distribution continually shifts over time. Specifically, we\npropose two novel ideas to tackle the problem: (1) Localized Alignment: We\nintroduce a small trainable multimodal encoder that predicts the audio and\nvideo tokens that are well-aligned with each other. This allows the model to\nlearn only the highly correlated audiovisual patches with accurate multimodal\nrelationships. (2) Forget-robust multimodal patch selection: We compare the\nrelative importance of each audio-video patch between the current and past data\npair to mitigate unintended drift of the previously learned audio-video\nrepresentations. Our proposed method, FLAVA (Forget-robust Localized\nAudio-Video Alignment), therefore, captures the complex relationships between\nthe audio and video modalities during training on a sequence of pre-training\ntasks while alleviating the forgetting of learned audiovisual correlations. Our\nexperiments validate that FLAVA outperforms the state-of-the-art continual\nlearning methods on several benchmark datasets under continual audio-video\nrepresentation learning scenarios.",

          "description": "Large language models (LLMs) often make factually incorrect responses despite\ntheir success in various applications. In this paper, we hypothesize that\nrelying heavily on simple co-occurrence statistics of the pre-training corpora\nis one of the main factors that cause factual errors. Our results reveal that\nLLMs are vulnerable to the co-occurrence bias, defined as preferring frequently\nco-occurred words over the correct answer. Consequently, LLMs struggle to\nrecall facts whose subject and object rarely co-occur in the pre-training\ndataset although they are seen during finetuning. We show that co-occurrence\nbias remains despite scaling up model sizes or finetuning. Therefore, we\nsuggest finetuning on a debiased dataset to mitigate the bias by filtering out\nbiased samples whose subject-object co-occurrence count is high. Although\ndebiased finetuning allows LLMs to memorize rare facts in the training set, it\nis not effective in recalling rare facts unseen during finetuning. Further\nresearch in mitigation will help build reliable language models by preventing\npotential errors. The code is available at\n\\url{https://github.com/CheongWoong/impact_of_cooccurrence}.",

Based on these properties, we define an\nextensible framework to evaluate language and table embedding models. We\ncollect and synthesize a suite of datasets and use Observatory to analyze seven\nsuch models. Our analysis provides insights into the strengths and weaknesses\nof learned representations over tables. We find, for example, that some models\nare sensitive to table structure such as column order, that functional\ndependencies are rarely reflected in embeddings, and that specialized table\nembedding models have relatively lower sample fidelity.

One recent approach looks at the infinitely wide limits of such\nnetworks and their corresponding kernels. However, these theoretical tools\ncannot fully explain finite networks as the empirical kernel changes\nsignificantly during gradient-descent-based training in contrast to infinite\nnetworks. In this work, we derive an iterative linearised training method as a\nnovel empirical tool to further investigate this distinction, allowing us to\ncontrol for sparse (i.e. infrequent) feature updates and quantify the frequency\nof feature learning needed to achieve comparable performance. We justify\niterative linearisation as an interpolation between a finite analog of the\ninfinite width regime, which does not learn features, and standard gradient\ndescent training, which does. Informally, we also show that it is analogous to\na damped version of the Gauss-Newton algorithm -- a second-order method. We\nshow that in a variety of cases, iterative linearised training surprisingly\nperforms on par with standard training, noting in particular how much less\nfrequent feature learning is required to achieve comparable performance.

          "description": "Large Language Models (LLMs) excel in NLP, but their demands hinder their\nwidespread deployment. While Quantization-Aware Training (QAT) offers a\nsolution, its extensive training costs make Post-Training Quantization (PTQ) a\nmore practical approach for LLMs. In existing studies, activation outliers in\nparticular channels are identified as the bottleneck to PTQ accuracy. They\npropose to transform the magnitudes from activations to weights, which however\noffers limited alleviation or suffers from unstable gradients, resulting in a\nsevere performance drop at low-bitwidth. In this paper, we propose QLLM, an\naccurate and efficient low-bitwidth PTQ method designed for LLMs. QLLM\nintroduces an adaptive channel reassembly technique that reallocates the\nmagnitude of outliers to other channels, thereby mitigating their impact on the\nquantization range. This is achieved by channel disassembly and channel\nassembly, which first breaks down the outlier channels into several\nsub-channels to ensure a more balanced distribution of activation magnitudes.\nThen similar channels are merged to maintain the original channel number for\nefficiency. Additionally, an adaptive strategy is designed to autonomously\ndetermine the optimal number of sub-channels for channel disassembly. To\nfurther compensate for the performance loss caused by quantization, we propose\nan efficient tuning method that only learns a small number of low-rank weights\nwhile freezing the pre-trained quantized model. After training, these low-rank\nparameters can be fused into the frozen weights without affecting inference.\nExtensive experiments on LLaMA-1 and LLaMA-2 show that QLLM can obtain accurate\nquantized models efficiently. For example, QLLM quantizes the 4-bit LLaMA-2-70B\nwithin 10 hours on a single A100-80G GPU, outperforming the previous\nstate-of-the-art method by 7.89% on the average accuracy across five zero-shot\ntasks.",

On the contrary, the brain continually learns,\naccommodates, and transfers knowledge across tasks by simultaneously leveraging\nseveral neurophysiological processes, including neurogenesis, active\nforgetting, neuromodulation, metaplasticity, experience rehearsal, and\ncontext-dependent gating, rarely resulting in CF. Inspired by how the brain\nexploits multiple mechanisms concurrently, we propose TriRE, a novel CL\nparadigm that encompasses retaining the most prominent neurons for each task,\nrevising and solidifying the extracted knowledge of current and past tasks, and\nactively promoting less active neurons for subsequent tasks through rewinding\nand relearning. Across CL settings, TriRE significantly reduces task\ninterference and surpasses different CL approaches considered in isolation.",

A conventional approach is training\na model with the unlabeled graphs on self-supervised tasks and then fine-tuning\nthe model on the prediction tasks. However, the self-supervised task knowledge\ncould not be aligned or sometimes conflicted with what the predictions needed.\nIn this paper, we propose to extract the knowledge underlying the large set of\nunlabeled graphs as a specific set of useful data points to augment each\nproperty prediction model.

          "description": "Many real-world prediction tasks have outcome variables that have\ncharacteristic heavy-tail distributions. Examples include copies of books sold,\nauction prices of art pieces, demand for commodities in warehouses, etc. By\nlearning heavy-tailed distributions, \"big and rare\" instances (e.g., the\nbest-sellers) will have accurate predictions. Most existing approaches are not\ndedicated to learning heavy-tailed distribution; thus, they heavily\nunder-predict such instances. To tackle this problem, we introduce Learning to\nPlace (L2P), which exploits the pairwise relationships between instances for\nlearning. In its training phase, L2P learns a pairwise preference classifier:\nis instance A > instance B? In its placing phase, L2P obtains a prediction by\nplacing the new instance among the known instances. Based on its placement, the\nnew instance is then assigned a value for its outcome variable. Experiments on\nreal data show that L2P outperforms competing approaches in terms of accuracy\nand ability to reproduce heavy-tailed outcome distribution. In addition, L2P\nprovides an interpretable model by placing each predicted instance in relation\nto its comparable neighbors. Interpretable models are highly desirable when\nlives and treasure are at stake.",

          "description": "Membership Inference Attacks (MIAs) aim to identify specific data samples\nwithin the private training dataset of machine learning models, leading to\nserious privacy violations and other sophisticated threats. Many practical\nblack-box MIAs require query access to the data distribution (the same\ndistribution where the private data is drawn) to train shadow models. By doing\nso, the adversary obtains models trained \"with\" or \"without\" samples drawn from\nthe distribution, and analyzes the characteristics of the samples under\nconsideration. The adversary is often required to train more than hundreds of\nshadow models to extract the signals needed for MIAs; this becomes the\ncomputational overhead of MIAs. In this paper, we propose that by strategically\nchoosing the samples, MI adversaries can maximize their attack success while\nminimizing the number of shadow models. First, our motivational experiments\nsuggest memorization as the key property explaining disparate sample\nvulnerability to MIAs. We formalize this through a theoretical bound that\nconnects MI advantage with memorization. Second, we show sample complexity\nbounds that connect the number of shadow models needed for MIAs with\nmemorization. Lastly, we confirm our theoretical arguments with comprehensive\nexperiments; by utilizing samples with high memorization scores, the adversary\ncan (a) significantly improve its efficacy regardless of the MIA used, and (b)\nreduce the number of shadow models by nearly two orders of magnitude compared\nto state-of-the-art approaches.",

Inspired by the great success\nof using a neural network to describe the optical field in computer vision, we\npropose a neural radio-frequency radiance field, NeRF$^\\textbf{2}$, which\nrepresents a continuous volumetric scene function that makes sense of an RF\nsignal's propagation.

As a physical-layer\nneural network, NeRF$^\\textbf{2}$ can take advantage of the learned statistic\nmodel plus the physical model of ray tracing to generate a synthetic dataset\nthat meets the training demands of application-layer artificial neural networks\n(ANNs). Thus, we can boost the performance of ANNs by the proposed\nturbo-learning, which mixes the true and synthetic datasets to intensify the\ntraining.

          "description": "Practical real world datasets with plentiful categories introduce new\nchallenges for unsupervised domain adaptation like small inter-class\ndiscriminability, that existing approaches relying on domain invariance alone\ncannot handle sufficiently well. In this work we propose MemSAC, which exploits\nsample level similarity across source and target domains to achieve\ndiscriminative transfer, along with architectures that scale to a large number\nof categories. For this purpose, we first introduce a memory augmented approach\nto efficiently extract pairwise similarity relations between labeled source and\nunlabeled target domain instances, suited to handle an arbitrary number of\nclasses. Next, we propose and theoretically justify a novel variant of the\ncontrastive loss to promote local consistency among within-class cross domain\nsamples while enforcing separation between classes, thus preserving\ndiscriminative transfer from source to target. We validate the advantages of\nMemSAC with significant improvements over previous state-of-the-art on multiple\nchallenging transfer tasks designed for large-scale adaptation, such as\nDomainNet with 345 classes and fine-grained adaptation on Caltech-UCSD birds\ndataset with 200 classes.

          "description": "This paper studies the fundamental problem of learning multi-layer generator\nmodels. The multi-layer generator model builds multiple layers of latent\nvariables as a prior model on top of the generator, which benefits learning\ncomplex data distribution and hierarchical representations. However, such a\nprior model usually focuses on modeling inter-layer relations between latent\nvariables by assuming non-informative (conditional) Gaussian distributions,\nwhich can be limited in model expressivity. To tackle this issue and learn more\nexpressive prior models, we propose an energy-based model (EBM) on the joint\nlatent space over all layers of latent variables with the multi-layer generator\nas its backbone. Such joint latent space EBM prior model captures the\nintra-layer contextual relations at each layer through layer-wise energy terms,\nand latent variables across different layers are jointly corrected. We develop\na joint training scheme via maximum likelihood estimation (MLE), which involves\nMarkov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling for both prior and posterior\ndistributions of the latent variables from different layers. To ensure\nefficient inference and learning, we further propose a variational training\nscheme where an inference model is used to amortize the costly posterior MCMC\nsampling. Our experiments demonstrate that the learned model can be expressive\nin generating high-quality images and capturing hierarchical features for\nbetter outlier detection.",

          "description": "Hyperdimensional computing (HDC) is a method to perform classification that\nuses binary vectors with high dimensions and the majority rule. This approach\nhas the potential to be energy-efficient and hence deemed suitable for\nresource-limited platforms due to its simplicity and massive parallelism.\nHowever, in order to achieve high accuracy, HDC sometimes uses hypervectors\nwith tens of thousands of dimensions. This potentially negates its efficiency\nadvantage. In this paper, we examine the necessity of such high dimensions and\nconduct a detailed theoretical analysis of the relationship between hypervector\ndimensions and accuracy. Our results demonstrate that as the dimension of the\nhypervectors increases, the worst-case/average-case HDC prediction accuracy\nwith the majority rule decreases. Building on this insight, we develop HDC\nmodels that use binary hypervectors with dimensions orders of magnitude lower\nthan those of state-of-the-art HDC models while maintaining equivalent or even\nimproved accuracy and efficiency. For instance, on the MNIST dataset, we\nachieve 91.12% HDC accuracy in image classification with a dimension of only\n64. Our methods perform operations that are only 0.35% of other HDC models with\ndimensions of 10,000.

          "description": "Multi-modal trajectory forecasting methods commonly evaluate using\nsingle-agent metrics (marginal metrics), such as minimum Average Displacement\nError (ADE) and Final Displacement Error (FDE), which fail to capture joint\nperformance of multiple interacting agents. Only focusing on marginal metrics\ncan lead to unnatural predictions, such as colliding trajectories or diverging\ntrajectories for people who are clearly walking together as a group.\nConsequently, methods optimized for marginal metrics lead to overly-optimistic\nestimations of performance, which is detrimental to progress in trajectory\nforecasting research. In response to the limitations of marginal metrics, we\npresent the first comprehensive evaluation of state-of-the-art (SOTA)\ntrajectory forecasting methods with respect to multi-agent metrics (joint\nmetrics): JADE, JFDE, and collision rate.

In particular, we analyze the Binary\nIterative Hard Thresholding (BIHT) algorithm, a proximal gradient descent on a\nproperly defined loss function used for 1-bit compressed sensing, in this noisy\nsetting. It is known from recent results that, with\n$\\tilde{O}(\\frac{k}{\\epsilon})$ noiseless measurements, BIHT provides an\nestimate within $\\epsilon$ error. This result is optimal and universal, meaning\none set of measurements work for all sparse vectors.

We show that when up to $\\tau$-fraction of the sign measurements are\nincorrect (adversarial error), with the same number of measurements as before,\nBIHT agnostically provides an estimate of $x$ within an\n$\\tilde{O}(\\epsilon+\\tau)$ error, maintaining the universality of measurements.\nThis establishes stability of iterative hard thresholding in the presence of\nmeasurement error.

          "description": "Bayesian Optimization (BO) is typically used to optimize an unknown function\n$f$ that is noisy and costly to evaluate, by exploiting an acquisition function\nthat must be maximized at each optimization step. Even if provably\nasymptotically optimal BO algorithms are efficient at optimizing\nlow-dimensional functions, scaling them to high-dimensional spaces remains an\nopen problem, often tackled by assuming an additive structure for $f$. By doing\nso, BO algorithms typically introduce additional restrictive assumptions on the\nadditive structure that reduce their applicability domain. This paper contains\ntwo main contributions: (i) we relax the restrictive assumptions on the\nadditive structure of $f$, at the expense of weakening the maximization\nguarantees of the acquisition function, and (ii) we address the\nover-exploration problem for decentralized BO algorithms. To these ends, we\npropose DumBO, an asymptotically optimal decentralized BO algorithm that\nachieves very competitive performance against state-of-the-art BO algorithms,\nespecially when the additive structure of $f$ comprises high-dimensional\nfactors.",

          "description": "Among recent developments in time series forecasting methods, deep\nforecasting models have gained popularity as they can utilize hidden feature\npatterns in time series to improve forecasting performance. Nevertheless, the\nmajority of current deep forecasting models are opaque, hence making it\nchallenging to interpret the results. While counterfactual explanations have\nbeen extensively employed as a post-hoc approach for explaining classification\nmodels, their application to forecasting models still remains underexplored. In\nthis paper, we formulate the novel problem of counterfactual generation for\ntime series forecasting, and propose an algorithm, called ForecastCF, that\nsolves the problem by applying gradient-based perturbations to the original\ntime series. ForecastCF guides the perturbations by applying constraints to the\nforecasted values to obtain desired prediction outcomes. We experimentally\nevaluate ForecastCF using four state-of-the-art deep model architectures and\ncompare to two baselines. Our results show that ForecastCF outperforms the\nbaseline in terms of counterfactual validity and data manifold closeness.\nOverall, our findings suggest that ForecastCF can generate meaningful and\nrelevant counterfactual explanations for various forecasting tasks.",

          "description": "Semantic identifier (ID) is an important concept in information retrieval\nthat aims to preserve the semantics of objects such as documents and items\ninside their IDs. Previous studies typically adopt a two-stage pipeline to\nlearn semantic IDs by first procuring embeddings using off-the-shelf text\nencoders and then deriving IDs based on the embeddings. However, each step\nintroduces potential information loss and there is usually an inherent mismatch\nbetween the distribution of embeddings within the latent space produced by text\nencoders and the anticipated distribution required for semantic indexing.\nNevertheless, it is non-trivial to design a method that can learn the\ndocument's semantic representations and its hierarchical structure\nsimultaneously, given that semantic IDs are discrete and sequentially\nstructured, and the semantic supervision is deficient. In this paper, we\nintroduce LMINDEXER, a self-supervised framework to learn semantic IDs with a\ngenerative language model. We tackle the challenge of sequential discrete ID by\nintroducing a semantic indexer capable of generating neural sequential discrete\nrepresentations with progressive training and contrastive learning. In response\nto the semantic supervision deficiency, we propose to train the model with a\nself-supervised document reconstruction objective. The learned semantic indexer\ncan facilitate various downstream tasks, such as recommendation and retrieval.\nWe conduct experiments on three tasks including recommendation, product search,\nand document retrieval on five datasets from various domains, where LMINDEXER\noutperforms competitive baselines significantly and consistently.",

However, the nature of the\nlearned relationships is opaque making it difficult to understand precisely\nwhat relationships between words and parts of an image are captured, or to\npredict the effect of an intervention. We illuminate the fine-grained\nrelationships learned by diffusion models by noticing a precise relationship\nbetween diffusion and information decomposition. Exact expressions for mutual\ninformation and conditional mutual information can be written in terms of the\ndenoising model. Furthermore, pointwise estimates can be easily estimated as\nwell, allowing us to ask questions about the relationships between specific\nimages and captions. Decomposing information even further to understand which\nvariables in a high-dimensional space carry information is a long-standing\nproblem. For diffusion models, we show that a natural non-negative\ndecomposition of mutual information emerges, allowing us to quantify\ninformative relationships between words and pixels in an image.

The standard methodology for\nbattery modelling is traditional design of experiments (DoE), where the battery\ndynamics are excited with many different current profiles and the measured\noutputs are used to estimate the system dynamics. However, although it is\npossible to obtain useful models with the traditional approach, the process is\ntime consuming and expensive because of the need to sweep many different\ncurrent-profile configurations. In the present work, a novel DoE approach is\ndeveloped based on deep reinforcement learning, which alters the configuration\nof the experiments on the fly based on the statistics of past experiments.\nInstead of sticking to a library of predefined current profiles, the proposed\napproach modifies the current profiles dynamically by updating the output space\ncovered by past measurements, hence only the current profiles that are\ninformative for future experiments are applied.

However, in practice,\ntransformers' reasoning can be improved by allowing them to use a \"chain of\nthought\" or \"scratchpad\", i.e., generate and condition on a sequence of\nintermediate tokens before answering. Motivated by this, we ask: Does such\nintermediate generation fundamentally extend the computational power of a\ndecoder-only transformer? We show that the answer is yes, but the amount of\nincrease depends crucially on the amount of intermediate generation. For\ninstance, we find that transformer decoders with a logarithmic number of\ndecoding steps (w.r.t. the input length) push the limits of standard\ntransformers only slightly, while a linear number of decoding steps adds a\nclear new ability (under standard complexity conjectures): recognizing all\nregular languages. Our results also imply that linear steps keep transformer\ndecoders within context-sensitive languages, and polynomial steps make them\nrecognize exactly the class of polynomial-time solvable problems -- the first\nexact characterization of a type of transformers in terms of standard\ncomplexity classes.

          "description": "We propose a novel surrogate modelling approach to efficiently and accurately\napproximate the response of complex dynamical systems driven by time-varying\nexogenous excitations over extended time periods. Our approach, namely manifold\nnonlinear autoregressive modelling with exogenous input (mNARX), involves\nconstructing a problem-specific exogenous input manifold that is optimal for\nconstructing autoregressive surrogates. The manifold, which forms the core of\nmNARX, is constructed incrementally by incorporating the physics of the system,\nas well as prior expert- and domain- knowledge. Because mNARX decomposes the\nfull problem into a series of smaller sub-problems, each with a lower\ncomplexity than the original, it scales well with the complexity of the\nproblem, both in terms of training and evaluation costs of the final surrogate.\nFurthermore, mNARX synergizes well with traditional dimensionality reduction\ntechniques, making it highly suitable for modelling dynamical systems with\nhigh-dimensional exogenous inputs, a class of problems that is typically\nchallenging to solve. Since domain knowledge is particularly abundant in\nphysical systems, such as those found in civil and mechanical engineering,\nmNARX is well suited for these applications. We demonstrate that mNARX\noutperforms traditional autoregressive surrogates in predicting the response of\na classical coupled spring-mass system excited by a one-dimensional random\nexcitation. Additionally, we show that mNARX is well suited for emulating very\nhigh-dimensional time- and state-dependent systems, even when affected by\nactive controllers, by surrogating the dynamics of a realistic\naero-servo-elastic onshore wind turbine simulator. In general, our results\ndemonstrate that mNARX offers promising prospects for modelling complex\ndynamical systems, in terms of accuracy and efficiency.",

          "description": "Deep learning vulnerability detection has shown promising results in recent\nyears. However, an important challenge that still blocks it from being very\nuseful in practice is that the model is not robust under perturbation and it\ncannot generalize well over the out-of-distribution (OOD) data, e.g., applying\na trained model to unseen projects in real world. We hypothesize that this is\nbecause the model learned non-robust features, e.g., variable names, that have\nspurious correlations with labels. When the perturbed and OOD datasets no\nlonger have the same spurious features, the model prediction fails. To address\nthe challenge, in this paper, we introduced causality into deep learning\nvulnerability detection. Our approach CausalVul consists of two phases. First,\nwe designed novel perturbations to discover spurious features that the model\nmay use to make predictions. Second, we applied the causal learning algorithms,\nspecifically, do-calculus, on top of existing deep learning models to\nsystematically remove the use of spurious features and thus promote causal\nbased prediction. Our results show that CausalVul consistently improved the\nmodel accuracy, robustness and OOD performance for all the state-of-the-art\nmodels and datasets we experimented. To the best of our knowledge, this is the\nfirst work that introduces do calculus based causal learning to software\nengineering models and shows it's indeed useful for improving the model\naccuracy, robustness and generalization.

          "description": "Analytical theories suggest that higher-quality data can lead to lower test\nerrors in models trained on a fixed data budget. Moreover, a model can be\ntrained on a lower compute budget without compromising performance if a dataset\ncan be stripped of its redundancies. Coreset selection (or data pruning) seeks\nto select a subset of the training data so as to maximize the performance of\nmodels trained on this subset, also referred to as coreset. There are two\ndominant approaches: (1) geometry-based data selection for maximizing data\ndiversity in the coreset, and (2) functions that assign difficulty scores to\nsamples based on training dynamics. Optimizing for data diversity leads to a\ncoreset that is biased towards easier samples, whereas, selection by difficulty\nranking omits easy samples that are necessary for the training of deep learning\nmodels. This demonstrates that data diversity and importance scores are two\ncomplementary factors that need to be jointly considered during coreset\nselection. We represent a dataset as an undirected graph and propose a novel\npruning algorithm, D2 Pruning, that uses forward and reverse message passing\nover this dataset graph for coreset selection. D2 Pruning updates the\ndifficulty scores of each example by incorporating the difficulty of its\nneighboring examples in the dataset graph. Then, these updated difficulty\nscores direct a graph-based sampling method to select a coreset that\nencapsulates both diverse and difficult regions of the dataset space. We\nevaluate supervised and self-supervised versions of our method on various\nvision and language datasets. Results show that D2 Pruning improves coreset\nselection over previous state-of-the-art methods for up to 70% pruning rates.\nAdditionally, we find that using D2 Pruning for filtering large multimodal\ndatasets leads to increased diversity in the dataset and improved\ngeneralization of pretrained models.",

          "description": "The growing interest in machine learning problems over graphs with additional\nnode information such as texts, images, or labels has popularized methods that\nrequire the costly operation of processing the entire graph. Yet, little effort\nhas been made to the development of fast local methods (i.e. without accessing\nthe entire graph) that extract useful information from such data. To that end,\nwe propose a study of local graph clustering using noisy node labels as a proxy\nfor additional node information. In this setting, nodes receive initial binary\nlabels based on cluster affiliation: 1 if they belong to the target cluster and\n0 otherwise. Subsequently, a fraction of these labels is flipped. We\ninvestigate the benefits of incorporating noisy labels for local graph\nclustering. By constructing a weighted graph with such labels, we study the\nperformance of graph diffusion-based local clustering method on both the\noriginal and the weighted graphs. From a theoretical perspective, we consider\nrecovering an unknown target cluster with a single seed node in a random graph\nwith independent noisy node labels. We provide sufficient conditions on the\nlabel noise under which, with high probability, using diffusion in the weighted\ngraph yields a more accurate recovery of the target cluster. This approach\nproves more effective than using the given labels alone or using diffusion in\nthe label-free original graph. Empirically, we show that reliable node labels\ncan be obtained with just a few samples from an attributed graph. Moreover,\nutilizing these labels via diffusion in the weighted graph leads to\nsignificantly better local clustering performance across several real-world\ndatasets, improving F1 scores by up to 13%.",

          "description": "We propose to use a simulation driven inverse inference approach to model the\ndynamics of tree branches under manipulation. Learning branch dynamics and\ngaining the ability to manipulate deformable vegetation can help with\nocclusion-prone tasks, such as fruit picking in dense foliage, as well as\nmoving overhanging vines and branches for navigation in dense vegetation. The\nunderlying deformable tree geometry is encapsulated as coarse spring\nabstractions executed on parallel, non-differentiable simulators. The implicit\nstatistical model defined by the simulator, reference trajectories obtained by\nactively probing the ground truth, and the Bayesian formalism, together guide\nthe spring parameter posterior density estimation. Our non-parametric inference\nalgorithm, based on Stein Variational Gradient Descent, incorporates\nbiologically motivated assumptions into the inference process as neural network\ndriven learnt joint priors; moreover, it leverages the finite difference scheme\nfor gradient approximations. Real and simulated experiments confirm that our\nmodel can predict deformation trajectories, quantify the estimation\nuncertainty, and it can perform better when base-lined against other inference\nalgorithms, particularly from the Monte Carlo family. The model displays strong\nrobustness properties in the presence of heteroscedastic sensor noise;\nfurthermore, it can generalise to unseen grasp locations.",

          "description": "This paper introduces Elastic Decision Transformer (EDT), a significant\nadvancement over the existing Decision Transformer (DT) and its variants.\nAlthough DT purports to generate an optimal trajectory, empirical evidence\nsuggests it struggles with trajectory stitching, a process involving the\ngeneration of an optimal or near-optimal trajectory from the best parts of a\nset of sub-optimal trajectories. The proposed EDT differentiates itself by\nfacilitating trajectory stitching during action inference at test time,\nachieved by adjusting the history length maintained in DT. Further, the EDT\noptimizes the trajectory by retaining a longer history when the previous\ntrajectory is optimal and a shorter one when it is sub-optimal, enabling it to\n\"stitch\" with a more optimal trajectory. Extensive experimentation demonstrates\nEDT's ability to bridge the performance gap between DT-based and Q\nLearning-based approaches. In particular, the EDT outperforms Q Learning-based\nmethods in a multi-task regime on the D4RL locomotion benchmark and Atari\ngames. Videos are available at: https://kristery.github.io/edt/",

The framework allows us to extract\nscale-invariant kernels from the dynamics for modeling at any scale.

          "description": "Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs) are a groundbreaking technology for\ninteracting with external devices using brain signals. Despite advancements,\nelectroencephalogram (EEG)-based Motor Imagery (MI) tasks face challenges like\namplitude and phase variability, and complex spatial correlations, with a need\nfor smaller model size and faster inference. This study introduces the LGL-BCI\nframework, employing a Geometric Deep Learning Framework for EEG processing in\nnon-Euclidean metric spaces, particularly the Symmetric Positive Definite (SPD)\nManifold space. LGL-BCI offers robust EEG data representation and captures\nspatial correlations. We propose an EEG channel selection solution via a\nfeature decomposition algorithm to reduce SPD matrix dimensionality, with a\nlossless transformation boosting inference speed. Extensive experiments show\nLGL-BCI's superior accuracy and efficiency compared to current solutions,\nhighlighting geometric deep learning's potential in MI-BCI applications. The\nefficiency, assessed on two public EEG datasets and two real-world EEG devices,\nsignificantly outperforms the state-of-the-art solution in accuracy ($82.54\\%$\nversus $62.22\\%$) with fewer parameters (64.9M compared to 183.7M).",

          "description": "Existing literature on adversarial Machine Learning (ML) focuses either on\nshowing attacks that break every ML model, or defenses that withstand most\nattacks. Unfortunately, little consideration is given to the actual feasibility\nof the attack or the defense. Moreover, adversarial samples are often crafted\nin the \"feature-space\", making the corresponding evaluations of questionable\nvalue. Simply put, the current situation does not allow to estimate the actual\nthreat posed by adversarial attacks, leading to a lack of secure ML systems.\n\nWe aim to clarify such confusion in this paper. By considering the\napplication of ML for Phishing Website Detection (PWD), we formalize the\n\"evasion-space\" in which an adversarial perturbation can be introduced to fool\na ML-PWD -- demonstrating that even perturbations in the \"feature-space\" are\nuseful. Then, we propose a realistic threat model describing evasion attacks\nagainst ML-PWD that are cheap to stage, and hence intrinsically more attractive\nfor real phishers. After that, we perform the first statistically validated\nassessment of state-of-the-art ML-PWD against 12 evasion attacks. Our\nevaluation shows (i) the true efficacy of evasion attempts that are more likely\nto occur; and (ii) the impact of perturbations crafted in different\nevasion-spaces. Our realistic evasion attempts induce a statistically\nsignificant degradation (3-10% at p<0.05), and their cheap cost makes them a\nsubtle threat. Notably, however, some ML-PWD are immune to our most realistic\nattacks (p=0.22).\n\nFinally, as an additional contribution of this journal publication, we are\nthe first to consider the intriguing case wherein an attacker introduces\nperturbations in multiple evasion-spaces at the same time. These new results\nshow that simultaneously applying perturbations in the problem- and\nfeature-space can cause a drop in the detection rate from 0.95 to 0.",

Existing model-free algorithms for online CMDPs with\nsublinear regret and constraint violation do not provide any convergence\nguarantee to an optimal policy and provide only average performance guarantees\nwhen a policy is uniformly sampled at random from all previously used policies.\nIn this paper, we develop a new algorithm, named\nPruning-Refinement-Identification (PRI), based on a fundamental structural\nproperty of CMDPs we discover, called limited stochasticity.

          "description": "With the success of large-scale pretraining in NLP, there is an increasing\ntrend of applying it to the domain of life sciences. In particular, pretraining\nmethods based on DNA sequences have garnered growing attention due to their\npotential to capture generic information about genes. However, existing\npretraining methods for DNA sequences largely rely on direct adoptions of BERT\npretraining from NLP, lacking a comprehensive understanding and a specifically\ntailored approach. To address this research gap, we first conducted a series of\nexploratory experiments and gained several insightful observations: 1) In the\nfine-tuning phase of downstream tasks, when using K-mer overlapping\ntokenization instead of K-mer non-overlapping tokenization, both overlapping\nand non-overlapping pretraining weights show consistent performance\nimprovement.2) During the pre-training process, using K-mer overlapping\ntokenization quickly produces clear K-mer embeddings and reduces the loss to a\nvery low level, while using K-mer non-overlapping tokenization results in less\ndistinct embeddings and continuously decreases the loss. 3) Using overlapping\ntokenization causes the self-attention in the intermediate layers of\npre-trained models to tend to overly focus on certain tokens, reflecting that\nthese layers are not adequately optimized. In summary, overlapping tokenization\ncan benefit the fine-tuning of downstream tasks but leads to inadequate\npretraining with fast convergence. To unleash the pretraining potential, we\nintroduce a novel approach called RandomMask, which gradually increases the\ntask difficulty of BERT-like pretraining by continuously expanding its mask\nboundary, forcing the model to learn more knowledge. RandomMask is simple but\neffective, achieving top-tier performance across 26 datasets of 28 datasets\nspanning 7 downstream tasks.",

It is\nwell-known that optimal and even approximately-optimal mechanisms for this\nsetting are notoriously difficult to characterize or compute, and, even when\nthey can be found, are often rife with various counter-intuitive properties. In\nthis paper, following a model introduced recently by Cai and\nDaskalakis~\\cite{cai2022recommender}, we consider the case that bidders' prior\ndistributions can be well-approximated by a topic model. We design an active\nlearning component, responsible for interacting with the bidders and outputting\nlow-dimensional approximations of their types, and a mechanism design\ncomponent, responsible for robustifying mechanisms for the low-dimensional\nmodel to work for the approximate types of the former component. On the active\nlearning front, we cast our problem in the framework of Randomized Linear\nAlgebra (RLA) for regression problems, allowing us to import several\nbreakthrough results from that line of research, and adapt them to our setting.\nOn the mechanism design front, we remove many restrictive assumptions of prior\nwork on the type of access needed to the underlying distributions and the\nassociated mechanisms.

          "description": "Current techniques for Out-of-Distribution (OoD) detection predominantly rely\non quantifying predictive uncertainty and incorporating model regularization\nduring the training phase, using either real or synthetic OoD samples. However,\nmethods that utilize real OoD samples lack exploration and are prone to overfit\nthe OoD samples at hand. Whereas synthetic samples are often generated based on\nfeatures extracted from training data, rendering them less effective when the\ntraining and OoD data are highly overlapped in the feature space. In this work,\nwe propose a Wasserstein-score-based generative adversarial training scheme to\nenhance OoD detection accuracy, which, for the first time, performs data\naugmentation and exploration simultaneously under the supervision of limited\nOoD samples. Specifically, the generator explores OoD spaces and generates\nsynthetic OoD samples using feedback from the discriminator, while the\ndiscriminator exploits both the observed and synthesized samples for OoD\ndetection using a predefined Wasserstein score. We provide theoretical\nguarantees that the optimal solutions of our generative scheme are\nstatistically achievable through adversarial training in empirical settings. We\nthen demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art\ntechniques on various computer vision datasets and exhibits superior\ngeneralizability to unseen OoD data.",

          "description": "Given an image and an associated textual question, the purpose of\nKnowledge-Based Visual Question Answering (KB-VQA) is to provide a correct\nanswer to the question with the aid of external knowledge bases. Prior KB-VQA\nmodels are usually formulated as a retriever-classifier framework, where a\npre-trained retriever extracts textual or visual information from knowledge\ngraphs and then makes a prediction among the candidates. Despite promising\nprogress, there are two drawbacks with existing models. Firstly, modeling\nquestion-answering as multi-class classification limits the answer space to a\npreset corpus and lacks the ability of flexible reasoning. Secondly, the\nclassifier merely consider \"what is the answer\" without \"how to get the\nanswer\", which cannot ground the answer to explicit reasoning paths. In this\npaper, we confront the challenge of \\emph{explainable open-set} KB-VQA, where\nthe system is required to answer questions with entities at wild and retain an\nexplainable reasoning path. To resolve the aforementioned issues, we propose a\nnew retriever-ranker paradigm of KB-VQA, Graph pATH rankER (GATHER for\nbrevity). Specifically, it contains graph constructing, pruning, and path-level\nranking, which not only retrieves accurate answers but also provides inference\npaths that explain the reasoning process. To comprehensively evaluate our\nmodel, we reformulate the benchmark dataset OK-VQA with manually corrected\nentity-level annotations and release it as ConceptVQA. Extensive experiments on\nreal-world questions demonstrate that our framework is not only able to perform\nopen-set question answering across the whole knowledge base but provide\nexplicit reasoning path.",

          "description": "Existing regression models tend to fall short in both accuracy and\nuncertainty estimation when the label distribution is imbalanced. In this\npaper, we propose a probabilistic deep learning model, dubbed variational\nimbalanced regression (VIR), which not only performs well in imbalanced\nregression but naturally produces reasonable uncertainty estimation as a\nbyproduct. Different from typical variational autoencoders assuming I.I.D.\nrepresentations (a data point's representation is not directly affected by\nother data points), our VIR borrows data with similar regression labels to\ncompute the latent representation's variational distribution; furthermore,\ndifferent from deterministic regression models producing point estimates, VIR\npredicts the entire normal-inverse-gamma distributions and modulates the\nassociated conjugate distributions to impose probabilistic reweighting on the\nimbalanced data, thereby providing better uncertainty estimation. Experiments\nin several real-world datasets show that our VIR can outperform\nstate-of-the-art imbalanced regression models in terms of both accuracy and\nuncertainty estimation.

          "description": "This system paper presents a software framework for the support of\ntopological analysis pipelines in a distributed-memory model. While several\nrecent papers introduced topology-based approaches for distributed-memory\nenvironments, these were reporting experiments obtained with tailored,\nmono-algorithm implementations. In contrast, we describe in this paper a\ngeneral-purpose, generic framework for topological analysis pipelines, i.e. a\nsequence of topological algorithms interacting together, possibly on distinct\nnumbers of processes. Specifically, we instantiated our framework with the MPI\nmodel, within the Topology ToolKit (TTK). While developing this framework, we\nfaced several algorithmic and software engineering challenges, which we\ndocument in this paper. We provide a taxonomy for the distributed-memory\ntopological algorithms supported by TTK, depending on their communication needs\nand provide examples of hybrid MPI+thread parallelizations. Detailed\nperformance analyses show that parallel efficiencies range from $20\\%$ to\n$80\\%$ (depending on the algorithms), and that the MPI-specific preconditioning\nintroduced by our framework induces a negligible computation time overhead. We\nillustrate the new distributed-memory capabilities of TTK with an example of\nadvanced analysis pipeline, combining multiple algorithms, run on the largest\npublicly available dataset we have found (120 billion vertices) on a standard\ncluster with 64 nodes (for a total of 1,536 cores).

          "description": "Background: Missing data is a common challenge in mass spectrometry-based\nmetabolomics, which can lead to biased and incomplete analyses. The integration\nof whole-genome sequencing (WGS) data with metabolomics data has emerged as a\npromising approach to enhance the accuracy of data imputation in metabolomics\nstudies. Method: In this study, we propose a novel method that leverages the\ninformation from WGS data and reference metabolites to impute unknown\nmetabolites. Our approach utilizes a multi-view variational autoencoder to\njointly model the burden score, polygenetic risk score (PGS), and linkage\ndisequilibrium (LD) pruned single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) for feature\nextraction and missing metabolomics data imputation. By learning the latent\nrepresentations of both omics data, our method can effectively impute missing\nmetabolomics values based on genomic information. Results: We evaluate the\nperformance of our method on empirical metabolomics datasets with missing\nvalues and demonstrate its superiority compared to conventional imputation\ntechniques. Using 35 template metabolites derived burden scores, PGS and\nLD-pruned SNPs, the proposed methods achieved r2-scores > 0.01 for 71.55% of\nmetabolites. Conclusion: The integration of WGS data in metabolomics imputation\nnot only improves data completeness but also enhances downstream analyses,\npaving the way for more comprehensive and accurate investigations of metabolic\npathways and disease associations. Our findings offer valuable insights into\nthe potential benefits of utilizing WGS data for metabolomics data imputation\nand underscore the importance of leveraging multi-modal data integration in\nprecision medicine research.",

          "description": "Image-level weakly-supervised semantic segmentation (WSSS) reduces the\nusually vast data annotation cost by surrogate segmentation masks during\ntraining. The typical approach involves training an image classification\nnetwork using global average pooling (GAP) on convolutional feature maps. This\nenables the estimation of object locations based on class activation maps\n(CAMs), which identify the importance of image regions. The CAMs are then used\nto generate pseudo-labels, in the form of segmentation masks, to supervise a\nsegmentation model in the absence of pixel-level ground truth. Our work is\nbased on two techniques for improving CAMs; importance sampling, which is a\nsubstitute for GAP, and the feature similarity loss, which utilizes a heuristic\nthat object contours almost always align with color edges in images. However,\nboth are based on the multinomial posterior with softmax, and implicitly assume\nthat classes are mutually exclusive, which turns out suboptimal in our\nexperiments. Thus, we reformulate both techniques based on binomial posteriors\nof multiple independent binary problems. This has two benefits; their\nperformance is improved and they become more general, resulting in an add-on\nmethod that can boost virtually any WSSS method. This is demonstrated on a wide\nvariety of baselines on the PASCAL VOC dataset, improving the region similarity\nand contour quality of all implemented state-of-the-art methods. Experiments on\nthe MS COCO dataset show that our proposed add-on is well-suited for\nlarge-scale settings. Our code is available at https://github.com/arvijj/hfpl.",

          "description": "Decision trees are interpretable models that are well-suited to non-linear\nlearning problems. Much work has been done on extending decision tree learning\nalgorithms with differential privacy, a system that guarantees the privacy of\nsamples within the training data. However, current state-of-the-art algorithms\nfor this purpose sacrifice much utility for a small privacy benefit. These\nsolutions create random decision nodes that reduce decision tree accuracy or\nspend an excessive share of the privacy budget on labeling leaves. Moreover,\nmany works do not support continuous features or leak information about them.\nWe propose a new method called PrivaTree based on private histograms that\nchooses good splits while consuming a small privacy budget. The resulting trees\nprovide a significantly better privacy-utility trade-off and accept mixed\nnumerical and categorical data without leaking information about numerical\nfeatures. Finally, while it is notoriously hard to give robustness guarantees\nagainst data poisoning attacks, we demonstrate bounds for the expected accuracy\nand success rates of backdoor attacks against differentially-private learners.\nBy leveraging the better privacy-utility trade-off of PrivaTree we are able to\ntrain decision trees with significantly better robustness against backdoor\nattacks compared to regular decision trees and with meaningful theoretical\nguarantees.",

          "description": "Despite the great progress of unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) with the\ndeep neural networks, current UDA models are opaque and cannot provide\npromising explanations, limiting their applications in the scenarios that\nrequire safe and controllable model decisions. At present, a surge of work\nfocuses on designing deep interpretable methods with adequate data annotations\nand only a few methods consider the distributional shift problem. Most existing\ninterpretable UDA methods are post-hoc ones, which cannot facilitate the model\nlearning process for performance enhancement. In this paper, we propose an\ninherently interpretable method, named Transferable Conceptual Prototype\nLearning (TCPL), which could simultaneously interpret and improve the processes\nof knowledge transfer and decision-making in UDA. To achieve this goal, we\ndesign a hierarchically prototypical module that transfers categorical basic\nconcepts from the source domain to the target domain and learns domain-shared\nprototypes for explaining the underlying reasoning process. With the learned\ntransferable prototypes, a self-predictive consistent pseudo-label strategy\nthat fuses confidence, predictions, and prototype information, is designed for\nselecting suitable target samples for pseudo annotations and gradually\nnarrowing down the domain gap. Comprehensive experiments show that the proposed\nmethod can not only provide effective and intuitive explanations but also\noutperform previous state-of-the-arts.",

This class is known to be more general than\nlinear MDPs, where the transition kernel and the reward function are assumed to\nbe linear functions of the feature vectors. As our first contribution, we show\nthat the difference between the two classes is the presence of states in\nlinearly $q^\\pi$-realizable MDPs where for any policy, all the actions have\napproximately equal values, and skipping over these states by following an\narbitrarily fixed policy in those states transforms the problem to a linear\nMDP.

          "description": "By encoding time series as a string of numerical digits, we can frame time\nseries forecasting as next-token prediction in text. Developing this approach,\nwe find that large language models (LLMs) such as GPT-3 and LLaMA-2 can\nsurprisingly zero-shot extrapolate time series at a level comparable to or\nexceeding the performance of purpose-built time series models trained on the\ndownstream tasks. To facilitate this performance, we propose procedures for\neffectively tokenizing time series data and converting discrete distributions\nover tokens into highly flexible densities over continuous values. We argue the\nsuccess of LLMs for time series stems from their ability to naturally represent\nmultimodal distributions, in conjunction with biases for simplicity, and\nrepetition, which align with the salient features in many time series, such as\nrepeated seasonal trends. We also show how LLMs can naturally handle missing\ndata without imputation through non-numerical text, accommodate textual side\ninformation, and answer questions to help explain predictions. While we find\nthat increasing model size generally improves performance on time series, we\nshow GPT-4 can perform worse than GPT-3 because of how it tokenizes numbers,\nand poor uncertainty calibration, which is likely the result of alignment\ninterventions such as RLHF.",

          "description": "Station keeping is an essential maneuver for Autonomous Surface Vehicles\n(ASVs), mainly when used in confined spaces, to carry out surveys that require\nthe ASV to keep its position or in collaboration with other vehicles where the\nrelative position has an impact over the mission. However, this maneuver can\nbecome challenging for classic feedback controllers due to the need for an\naccurate model of the ASV dynamics and the environmental disturbances. This\nwork proposes a Model Predictive Controller using Neural Network Simulation\nError Minimization (NNSEM-MPC) to accurately predict the dynamics of the ASV\nunder wind disturbances. The performance of the proposed scheme under wind\ndisturbances is tested and compared against other controllers in simulation,\nusing the Robotics Operating System (ROS) and the multipurpose simulation\nenvironment Gazebo. A set of six tests were conducted by combining two wind\nspeeds (3 m/s and 6 m/s) and three wind directions (0$^\\circ$, 90$^\\circ$, and\n180$^\\circ$). The simulation results clearly show the advantage of the\nNNSEM-MPC over the following methods: backstepping controller, sliding mode\ncontroller, simplified dynamics MPC (SD-MPC), neural ordinary differential\nequation MPC (NODE-MPC), and knowledge-based NODE MPC (KNODE-MPC). The proposed\nNNSEM-MPC approach performs better than the rest in 4 out of the 6 test\nconditions, and it is the second best in the 2 remaining test cases, reducing\nthe mean position and heading error by at least 31\\% and 46\\% respectively\nacross all the test cases. In terms of execution speed, the proposed NNSEM-MPC\nis at least 36\\% faster than the rest of the MPC controllers. The field\nexperiments on two different ASV platforms showed that ASVs can effectively\nkeep the station utilizing the proposed method, with a position error as low as\n$1.68$ m and a heading error as low as $6.14^{\\circ}$ within time windows of at\nleast $150$s.",

          "description": "Robotic learning for navigation in unfamiliar environments needs to provide\npolicies for both task-oriented navigation (i.e., reaching a goal that the\nrobot has located), and task-agnostic exploration (i.e., searching for a goal\nin a novel setting). Typically, these roles are handled by separate models, for\nexample by using subgoal proposals, planning, or separate navigation\nstrategies. In this paper, we describe how we can train a single unified\ndiffusion policy to handle both goal-directed navigation and goal-agnostic\nexploration, with the latter providing the ability to search novel\nenvironments, and the former providing the ability to reach a user-specified\ngoal once it has been located. We show that this unified policy results in\nbetter overall performance when navigating to visually indicated goals in novel\nenvironments, as compared to approaches that use subgoal proposals from\ngenerative models, or prior methods based on latent variable models. We\ninstantiate our method by using a large-scale Transformer-based policy trained\non data from multiple ground robots, with a diffusion model decoder to flexibly\nhandle both goal-conditioned and goal-agnostic navigation. Our experiments,\nconducted on a real-world mobile robot platform, show effective navigation in\nunseen environments in comparison with five alternative methods, and\ndemonstrate significant improvements in performance and lower collision rates,\ndespite utilizing smaller models than state-of-the-art approaches.

          "description": "Learning rate schedules used in practice bear little resemblance to those\nrecommended by theory. We close much of this theory/practice gap, and as a\nconsequence are able to derive new problem-adaptive learning rate schedules.\nOur key technical contribution is a refined analysis of learning rate schedules\nfor a wide class of optimization algorithms (including SGD). In contrast to\nmost prior works that study the convergence of the average iterate, we study\nthe last iterate, which is what most people use in practice. When considering\nonly worst-case analysis, our theory predicts that the best choice is the\nlinear decay schedule: a popular choice in practice that sets the stepsize\nproportionally to $1 - t/T$, where $t$ is the current iteration and $T$ is the\ntotal number of steps. To go beyond this worst-case analysis, we use the\nobserved gradient norms to derive schedules refined for any particular task.\nThese refined schedules exhibit learning rate warm-up and rapid learning rate\nannealing near the end of training. Ours is the first systematic approach to\nautomatically yield both of these properties. We perform the most comprehensive\nevaluation of learning rate schedules to date, evaluating across 10 diverse\ndeep learning problems, a series of LLMs, and a suite of logistic regression\nproblems. We validate that overall, the linear-decay schedule matches or\noutperforms all commonly used default schedules including cosine annealing, and\nthat our schedule refinement method gives further improvements.",

We show analytically that rectangular networks with tanh\nactivations and weights initialized from the ensemble of orthogonal matrices\nhave corresponding preactivation fluctuations which are independent of depth,\nto leading order in inverse width. Moreover, we demonstrate numerically that,\nat initialization, all correlators involving the neural tangent kernel (NTK)\nand its descendants at leading order in inverse width -- which govern the\nevolution of observables during training -- saturate at a depth of $\\sim 20$,\nrather than growing without bound as in the case of Gaussian initializations.\nWe speculate that this structure preserves finite-width feature learning while\nreducing overall noise, thus improving both generalization and training speed.\nWe provide some experimental justification by relating empirical measurements\nof the NTK to the superior performance of deep nonlinear orthogonal networks\ntrained under full-batch gradient descent on the MNIST and CIFAR-10\nclassification tasks.",

          "description": "A common approach to explain NLP models, is to use importance measures that\nexpress which tokens are important for a prediction. Unfortunately, such\nexplanations are often wrong despite being persuasive. Therefore, it is\nessential to measure their faithfulness. One such metric is if tokens are truly\nimportant, then masking them should result in worse model performance. However,\ntoken masking introduces out-of-distribution issues and existing solutions are\ncomputationally expensive and employ proxy-models. Furthermore, other metrics\nare very limited in scope. In this work, we propose an inherently faithfulness\nmeasurable model that addresses these challenges. This is achieved by using a\nnovel fine-tuning method that incorporates masking, such that masking tokens\nbecome in-distribution by design. This differs from existing approaches, which\nare completely model-agnostic but are inapplicable in practice. We demonstrate\nthe generality of our approach by applying it to various tasks and validate it\nusing statistical in-distribution tests. Additionally, because masking is\nin-distribution, importance measures which themselves use masking become more\nfaithful, thus our model becomes more explainable.",

By integrating the unique advantages of\nthese two diverse activation functions, PLTanh facilitates the learning of more\nintricate nonlinear relationships within the network. This paper presents an\nempirical evaluation of PLTanh against established activation functions, namely\nReLU, LReLU, and ALReLU utilizing five diverse datasets.",

While predictive methods\nhold promise, their reliance on precise state information makes them less\npractical for real-world implementation. This study presents visual forecasting\nas an innovative alternative. By introducing intuitive visual cues, this\napproach projects the future trajectories of dynamic objects to improve agent\nperception and enable anticipatory actions. Our research explores two distinct\nstrategies for conveying predictive information through visual forecasting: (1)\nsequences of bounding boxes, and (2) augmented paths. To validate the proposed\nvisual forecasting strategies, we initiate evaluations in simulated\nenvironments using the Unity engine and then extend these evaluations to\nreal-world scenarios to assess both practicality and effectiveness. The results\nconfirm the viability of visual forecasting as a promising solution for\nnavigation and obstacle avoidance in dynamic environments.",

The deployment of GCNs in the cloud raises\nprivacy concerns due to potential adversarial attacks on client data. To\naddress security concerns, Privacy-Preserving Machine Learning (PPML) using\nHomomorphic Encryption (HE) secures sensitive client data. However, it\nintroduces substantial computational overhead in practical applications. To\ntackle those challenges, we present LinGCN, a framework designed to reduce\nmultiplication depth and optimize the performance of HE based GCN inference.\nLinGCN is structured around three key elements: (1) A differentiable structural\nlinearization algorithm, complemented by a parameterized discrete indicator\nfunction, co-trained with model weights to meet the optimization goal. This\nstrategy promotes fine-grained node-level non-linear location selection,\nresulting in a model with minimized multiplication depth. (2) A compact\nnode-wise polynomial replacement policy with a second-order trainable\nactivation function, steered towards superior convergence by a two-level\ndistillation approach from an all-ReLU based teacher model. (3) an enhanced HE\nsolution that enables finer-grained operator fusion for node-wise activation\nfunctions, further reducing multiplication level consumption in HE-based\ninference. Our experiments on the NTU-XVIEW skeleton joint dataset reveal that\nLinGCN excels in latency, accuracy, and scalability for homomorphically\nencrypted inference, outperforming solutions such as CryptoGCN. Remarkably,\nLinGCN achieves a 14.2x latency speedup relative to CryptoGCN, while preserving\nan inference accuracy of 75% and notably reducing multiplication depth.",

With spuriosity rankings, it\nis easy to identify minority subpopulations (i.e. low spuriosity images) and\nassess model bias as the gap in accuracy between high and low spuriosity\nimages. One can even efficiently remove a model's bias at little cost to\naccuracy by finetuning its classification head on low spuriosity images,\nresulting in fairer treatment of samples regardless of spuriosity.

          "description": "Anomaly detection has recently gained increasing attention in the field of\ncomputer vision, likely due to its broad set of applications ranging from\nproduct fault detection on industrial production lines and impending event\ndetection in video surveillance to finding lesions in medical scans. Regardless\nof the domain, anomaly detection is typically framed as a one-class\nclassification task, where the learning is conducted on normal examples only.\nAn entire family of successful anomaly detection methods is based on learning\nto reconstruct masked normal inputs (e.g. patches, future frames, etc.) and\nexerting the magnitude of the reconstruction error as an indicator for the\nabnormality level. Unlike other reconstruction-based methods, we present a\nnovel self-supervised masked convolutional transformer block (SSMCTB) that\ncomprises the reconstruction-based functionality at a core architectural level.\nThe proposed self-supervised block is extremely flexible, enabling information\nmasking at any layer of a neural network and being compatible with a wide range\nof neural architectures. In this work, we extend our previous self-supervised\npredictive convolutional attentive block (SSPCAB) with a 3D masked\nconvolutional layer, a transformer for channel-wise attention, as well as a\nnovel self-supervised objective based on Huber loss. Furthermore, we show that\nour block is applicable to a wider variety of tasks, adding anomaly detection\nin medical images and thermal videos to the previously considered tasks based\non RGB images and surveillance videos. We exhibit the generality and\nflexibility of SSMCTB by integrating it into multiple state-of-the-art neural\nmodels for anomaly detection, bringing forth empirical results that confirm\nconsiderable performance improvements on five benchmarks. We release our code\nand data as open source at: https://github.com/ristea/ssmctb.",

          "description": "A robot self-model is a task-agnostic representation of the robot's physical\nmorphology that can be used for motion planning tasks in absence of classical\ngeometric kinematic models. In particular, when the latter are hard to engineer\nor the robot's kinematics change unexpectedly, human-free self-modeling is a\nnecessary feature of truly autonomous agents. In this work, we leverage neural\nfields to allow a robot to self-model its kinematics as a neural-implicit query\nmodel learned only from 2D images annotated with camera poses and\nconfigurations. This enables significantly greater applicability than existing\napproaches which have been dependent on depth images or geometry knowledge. To\nthis end, alongside a curricular data sampling strategy, we propose a new\nencoder-based neural density field architecture for dynamic object-centric\nscenes conditioned on high numbers of degrees of freedom (DOFs). In a 7-DOF\nrobot test setup, the learned self-model achieves a Chamfer-L2 distance of 2%\nof the robot's workspace dimension.

          "description": "Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) are a formal framework for modeling and\nsolving sequential decision-making problems. In finite-time horizons such\nproblems are relevant for instance for optimal stopping or specific supply\nchain problems, but also in the training of large language models. In contrast\nto infinite horizon MDPs optimal policies are not stationary, policies must be\nlearned for every single epoch. In practice all parameters are often trained\nsimultaneously, ignoring the inherent structure suggested by dynamic\nprogramming. This paper introduces a combination of dynamic programming and\npolicy gradient called dynamic policy gradient, where the parameters are\ntrained backwards in time. For the tabular softmax parametrisation we carry out\nthe convergence analysis for simultaneous and dynamic policy gradient towards\nglobal optima, both in the exact and sampled gradient settings without\nregularisation. It turns out that the use of dynamic policy gradient training\nmuch better exploits the structure of finite-time problems which is reflected\nin improved convergence bounds.",

          "description": "High-quality text embedding is pivotal in improving semantic textual\nsimilarity (STS) tasks, which are crucial components in Large Language Model\n(LLM) applications. However, a common challenge existing text embedding models\nface is the problem of vanishing gradients, primarily due to their reliance on\nthe cosine function in the optimization objective, which has saturation zones.\nTo address this issue, this paper proposes a novel angle-optimized text\nembedding model called AnglE. The core idea of AnglE is to introduce angle\noptimization in a complex space. This novel approach effectively mitigates the\nadverse effects of the saturation zone in the cosine function, which can impede\ngradient and hinder optimization processes. To set up a comprehensive STS\nevaluation, we experimented on existing short-text STS datasets and a newly\ncollected long-text STS dataset from GitHub Issues. Furthermore, we examine\ndomain-specific STS scenarios with limited labeled data and explore how AnglE\nworks with LLM-annotated data. Extensive experiments were conducted on various\ntasks including short-text STS, long-text STS, and domain-specific STS tasks.\nThe results show that AnglE outperforms the state-of-the-art (SOTA) STS models\nthat ignore the cosine saturation zone. These findings demonstrate the ability\nof AnglE to generate high-quality text embeddings and the usefulness of angle\noptimization in STS.",

A DL consists of a\nsyntax in which specifications are stated and an interpretation function that\ntranslates expressions in the syntax into loss functions. These loss functions\ncan then be used during training with standard gradient descent algorithms. The\nvariety of existing DLs and the differing levels of formality with which they\nare treated makes a systematic comparative study of their properties and\nimplementations difficult. This paper remedies this problem by suggesting a\nmeta-language for defining DLs that we call the Logic of Differentiable Logics,\nor LDL. Syntactically, it generalises the syntax of existing DLs to FOL, and\nfor the first time introduces the formalism for reasoning about vectors and\nlearners. Semantically, it introduces a general interpretation function that\ncan be instantiated to define loss functions arising from different existing\nDLs.

However, existing methods usually revolve\naround the algorithm design while overlooking the significance of data\nengineering. Medical tabular datasets frequently exhibit significant\nheterogeneity across different sources, with limited sample sizes per source.\nAs such, previous predictors are often trained on manually curated small\ndatasets that struggle to generalize across different tabular datasets during\ninference. This paper proposes to scale medical tabular data predictors\n(MediTab) to various tabular inputs with varying features. The method uses a\ndata engine that leverages large language models (LLMs) to consolidate tabular\nsamples to overcome the barrier across tables with distinct schema. It also\naligns out-domain data with the target task using a \"learn, annotate, and\nrefinement\" pipeline. The expanded training data then enables the pre-trained\nMediTab to infer for arbitrary tabular input in the domain without fine-tuning,\nresulting in significant improvements over supervised baselines: it reaches an\naverage ranking of 1.57 and 1.00 on 7 patient outcome prediction datasets and 3\ntrial outcome prediction datasets, respectively.

The first class, SeparatorFactorization(SF),\nleverages the bounded genus of point cloud mesh graphs, while the second class,\nRFDiffusion(RFD), uses popular epsilon-nearest-neighbor graph representations\nfor point clouds. Both can be viewed as providing the functionality of Fast\nMultipole Methods (FMMs), which have had a tremendous impact on efficient\nintegration, but for non-Euclidean spaces. We focus on geometries induced by\ndistributions of walk lengths between points (e.g., shortest-path distance). We\nprovide an extensive theoretical analysis of our algorithms, obtaining new\nresults in structural graph theory as a byproduct. We also perform exhaustive\nempirical evaluation, including on-surface interpolation for rigid and\ndeformable objects (particularly for mesh-dynamics modeling), Wasserstein\ndistance computations for point clouds, and the Gromov-Wasserstein variant.",

          "description": "Multimodal learning models have become increasingly important as they surpass\nsingle-modality approaches on diverse tasks ranging from question-answering to\nautonomous driving. Despite the importance of multimodal learning, existing\nefforts focus on NLP applications, where the number of modalities is typically\nless than four (audio, video, text, images). However, data inputs in other\ndomains, such as the medical field, may include X-rays, PET scans, MRIs,\ngenetic screening, clinical notes, and more, creating a need for both efficient\nand accurate information fusion. Many state-of-the-art models rely on pairwise\ncross-modal attention, which does not scale well for applications with more\nthan three modalities. For $n$ modalities, computing attention will result in\n$n \\choose 2$ operations, potentially requiring considerable amounts of\ncomputational resources. To address this, we propose a new domain-neutral\nattention mechanism, One-Versus-Others (OvO) attention, that scales linearly\nwith the number of modalities and requires only $n$ attention operations, thus\noffering a significant reduction in computational complexity compared to\nexisting cross-modal attention algorithms. Using three diverse real-world\ndatasets as well as an additional simulation experiment, we show that our\nmethod improves performance compared to popular fusion techniques while\ndecreasing computation costs.",

To address the issue, we design Federated learning with global-local\nKnowledge Fusion (FedKF) scheme in this paper. The key idea in FedKF is to let\nthe server return the global knowledge to be fused with the local knowledge in\neach training round so that the local model can be regularized towards the\nglobal optima. Therefore, the client model drift issue can be mitigated. In\nFedKF, we first propose the active-inactive model aggregation technique that\nsupports a precise global knowledge representation. Then, we propose a\ndata-free knowledge distillation (KD) approach to enable each client model to\nlearn the global knowledge (embedded in the global model) while each client\nmodel can still learn the local knowledge (embedded in the local dataset)\nsimultaneously, thereby realizing the global-local knowledge fusion process.\nThe theoretical analysis and intensive experiments demonstrate the superiority\nof FedKF over previous solutions.",

          "description": "Optimizing large language models (LLMs) for downstream use cases often\ninvolves the customization of pre-trained LLMs through further fine-tuning.\nMeta's open release of Llama models and OpenAI's APIs for fine-tuning GPT-3.5\nTurbo on custom datasets also encourage this practice. But, what are the safety\ncosts associated with such custom fine-tuning? We note that while existing\nsafety alignment infrastructures can restrict harmful behaviors of LLMs at\ninference time, they do not cover safety risks when fine-tuning privileges are\nextended to end-users. Our red teaming studies find that the safety alignment\nof LLMs can be compromised by fine-tuning with only a few adversarially\ndesigned training examples. For instance, we jailbreak GPT-3.5 Turbo's safety\nguardrails by fine-tuning it on only 10 such examples at a cost of less than\n$0.20 via OpenAI's APIs, making the model responsive to nearly any harmful\ninstructions. Disconcertingly, our research also reveals that, even without\nmalicious intent, simply fine-tuning with benign and commonly used datasets can\nalso inadvertently degrade the safety alignment of LLMs, though to a lesser\nextent. These findings suggest that fine-tuning aligned LLMs introduces new\nsafety risks that current safety infrastructures fall short of addressing --\neven if a model's initial safety alignment is impeccable, it is not necessarily\nto be maintained after custom fine-tuning. We outline and critically analyze\npotential mitigations and advocate for further research efforts toward\nreinforcing safety protocols for the custom fine-tuning of aligned LLMs.",

While\nprevious work has established that Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs)\nexponentially lose expressive power, it remains controversial whether the graph\nattention mechanism can mitigate oversmoothing. In this work, we provide a\ndefinitive answer to this question through a rigorous mathematical analysis, by\nviewing attention-based GNNs as nonlinear time-varying dynamical systems and\nincorporating tools and techniques from the theory of products of inhomogeneous\nmatrices and the joint spectral radius. We establish that, contrary to popular\nbelief, the graph attention mechanism cannot prevent oversmoothing and loses\nexpressive power exponentially. The proposed framework extends the existing\nresults on oversmoothing for symmetric GCNs to a significantly broader class of\nGNN models, including random walk GCNs, Graph Attention Networks (GATs) and\n(graph) transformers. In particular, our analysis accounts for asymmetric,\nstate-dependent and time-varying aggregation operators and a wide range of\ncommon nonlinear activation functions, such as ReLU, LeakyReLU, GELU and SiLU.",

          "description": "Unsupervised anomaly segmentation aims to detect patterns that are distinct\nfrom any patterns processed during training, commonly called abnormal or\nout-of-distribution patterns, without providing any associated manual\nsegmentations. Since anomalies during deployment can lead to model failure,\ndetecting the anomaly can enhance the reliability of models, which is valuable\nin high-risk domains like medical imaging. This paper introduces Masked\nModality Cycles with Conditional Diffusion (MMCCD), a method that enables\nsegmentation of anomalies across diverse patterns in multimodal MRI. The method\nis based on two fundamental ideas. First, we propose the use of cyclic modality\ntranslation as a mechanism for enabling abnormality detection.\nImage-translation models learn tissue-specific modality mappings, which are\ncharacteristic of tissue physiology. Thus, these learned mappings fail to\ntranslate tissues or image patterns that have never been encountered during\ntraining, and the error enables their segmentation. Furthermore, we combine\nimage translation with a masked conditional diffusion model, which attempts to\n`imagine' what tissue exists under a masked area, further exposing unknown\npatterns as the generative model fails to recreate them. We evaluate our method\non a proxy task by training on healthy-looking slices of BraTS2021\nmulti-modality MRIs and testing on slices with tumors. We show that our method\ncompares favorably to previous unsupervised approaches based on image\nreconstruction and denoising with autoencoders and diffusion models.",

          "description": "Programs involving discontinuities introduced by control flow constructs such\nas conditional branches pose challenges to mathematical optimization methods\nthat assume a degree of smoothness in the objective function's response\nsurface. Smooth interpretation (SI) is a form of abstract interpretation that\napproximates the convolution of a program's output with a Gaussian kernel, thus\nsmoothing its output in a principled manner. Here, we combine SI with automatic\ndifferentiation (AD) to efficiently compute gradients of smoothed programs. In\ncontrast to AD across a regular program execution, these gradients also capture\nthe effects of alternative control flow paths. The combination of SI with AD\nenables the direct gradient-based parameter synthesis for branching programs,\nallowing for instance the calibration of simulation models or their combination\nwith neural network models in machine learning pipelines. We detail the effects\nof the approximations made for tractability in SI and propose a novel Monte\nCarlo estimator that avoids the underlying assumptions by estimating the\nsmoothed programs' gradients through a combination of AD and sampling. Using\nDiscoGrad, our tool for automatically translating simple C++ programs to a\nsmooth differentiable form, we perform an extensive evaluation. We compare the\ncombination of SI with AD and our Monte Carlo estimator to existing\ngradient-free and stochastic methods on four non-trivial and originally\ndiscontinuous problems ranging from classical simulation-based optimization to\nneural network-driven control. While the optimization progress with the\nSI-based estimator depends on the complexity of the programs' control flow, our\nMonte Carlo estimator is competitive in all problems, exhibiting the fastest\nconvergence by a substantial margin in our highest-dimensional problem.",

Experiments demonstrate that the final forecasts from the\ncascaded models show accurate predictions up to a 36-hour rollout, with SSIM\nand PSNR values exceeding 0.5 and 20 dB, respectively, for all three tasks.\nThis work also highlights the promising efficiency of AI methods such as\ndiffusion models for high-performance needs, such as cyclone forecasting, while\nremaining computationally affordable, making them ideal for highly vulnerable\nregions with critical forecasting needs and financial limitations.

At the core of the\nAbstractor is a variant of attention called relational cross-attention.

This enables explicit relational reasoning,\nsupporting abstraction and generalization from limited data. The Abstractor is\nfirst evaluated on simple discriminative relational tasks and compared to\nexisting relational architectures. Next, the Abstractor is evaluated on purely\nrelational sequence-to-sequence tasks, where dramatic improvements are seen in\nsample efficiency compared to standard Transformers.

          "description": "The one of the significant challenges faced by autonomous robotic ultrasound\nsystems is acquiring high-quality images across different patients. The proper\norientation of the robotized probe plays a crucial role in governing the\nquality of ultrasound images. To address this challenge, we propose a\nsample-efficient method to automatically adjust the orientation of the\nultrasound probe normal to the point of contact on the scanning surface,\nthereby improving the acoustic coupling of the probe and resulting image\nquality. Our method utilizes Bayesian Optimization (BO) based search on the\nscanning surface to efficiently search for the normalized probe orientation. We\nformulate a novel objective function for BO that leverages the contact force\nmeasurements and underlying mechanics to identify the normal. We further\nincorporate a regularization scheme in BO to handle the noisy objective\nfunction. The performance of the proposed strategy has been assessed through\nexperiments on urinary bladder phantoms. These phantoms included planar,\ntilted, and rough surfaces, and were examined using both linear and convex\nprobes with varying search space limits. Further, simulation-based studies have\nbeen carried out using 3D human mesh models. The results demonstrate that the\nmean ($\\pm$SD) absolute angular error averaged over all phantoms and 3D models\nis $\\boldsymbol{2.4\\pm0.7^\\circ}$ and $\\boldsymbol{2.1\\pm1.3^\\circ}$,\nrespectively.",

          "description": "A prominent theory of affective response to music revolves around the\nconcepts of surprisal and expectation. In prior work, this idea has been\noperationalized in the form of probabilistic models of music which allow for\nprecise computation of song (or note-by-note) probabilities, conditioned on a\n'training set' of prior musical or cultural experiences. To date, however,\nthese models have been limited to compute exact probabilities through\nhand-crafted features or restricted to linear models which are likely not\nsufficient to represent the complex conditional distributions present in music.\nIn this work, we propose to use modern deep probabilistic generative models in\nthe form of a Diffusion Model to compute an approximate likelihood of a musical\ninput sequence. Unlike prior work, such a generative model parameterized by\ndeep neural networks is able to learn complex non-linear features directly from\na training set itself. In doing so, we expect to find that such models are able\nto more accurately represent the 'surprisal' of music for human listeners. From\nthe literature, it is known that there is an inverted U-shaped relationship\nbetween surprisal and the amount human subjects 'like' a given song. In this\nwork we show that pre-trained diffusion models indeed yield musical surprisal\nvalues which exhibit a negative quadratic relationship with measured subject\n'liking' ratings, and that the quality of this relationship is competitive with\nstate of the art methods such as IDyOM. We therefore present this model a\npreliminary step in developing modern deep generative models of music\nexpectation and subjective likability.",

          "description": "A key limitation preventing the wider adoption of autonomous agents trained\nvia deep reinforcement learning (RL) is their limited ability to generalise to\nnew environments, even when these share similar characteristics with\nenvironments encountered during training. In this work, we investigate how a\nnon-uniform sampling strategy of individual environment instances, or levels,\naffects the zero-shot generalisation (ZSG) ability of RL agents, considering\ntwo failure modes: overfitting and over-generalisation. As a first step, we\nmeasure the mutual information (MI) between the agent's internal representation\nand the set of training levels, which we find to be well-correlated to instance\noverfitting. In contrast to uniform sampling, adaptive sampling strategies\nprioritising levels based on their value loss are more effective at maintaining\nlower MI, which provides a novel theoretical justification for this class of\ntechniques. We then turn our attention to unsupervised environment design (UED)\nmethods, which adaptively generate new training levels and minimise MI more\neffectively than methods sampling from a fixed set. However, we find UED\nmethods significantly shift the training distribution, resulting in\nover-generalisation and worse ZSG performance over the distribution of\ninterest. To prevent both instance overfitting and over-generalisation, we\nintroduce self-supervised environment design (SSED). SSED generates levels\nusing a variational autoencoder, effectively reducing MI while minimising the\nshift with the distribution of interest, and leads to statistically significant\nimprovements in ZSG over fixed-set level sampling strategies and UED methods.",

Curiously, he\nemployed both an improper (right Haar) mixture over $\\sigma$ and an improper\n(flat) mixture over $\\mu$. Here, we elaborate carefully on the details of his\nconstruction, which use generalized nonintegrable martingales and an extended\nVille's inequality. While this does yield a sequential t-test, it does not\nyield an ``e-process'' (due to the nonintegrability of his martingale). In this\npaper, we develop two new e-processes and confidence sequences for the same\nsetting: one is a test martingale in a reduced filtration, while the other is\nan e-process in the canonical data filtration. These are respectively obtained\nby swapping Lai's flat mixture for a Gaussian mixture, and swapping the right\nHaar mixture over $\\sigma$ with the maximum likelihood estimate under the null,\nas done in universal inference.

However, the cascading impact of\nsuch attacks is often overlooked, even though cascades are one of the primary\ncauses of large-scale blackouts. This paper explores modifications of\ntransmission line protection settings as candidates for adversarial attacks,\nwhich can remain undetectable as long as the network equilibrium state remains\nunaltered. This forms the basis of a black-box function in a Bayesian\noptimization procedure, where the objective is to find protection settings that\nmaximize network degradation due to cascading. Notably, our proposed method is\nagnostic to the choice of the cascade simulator and its underlying assumptions.\nNumerical experiments reveal that, against conventional wisdom, maximally\nmisconfiguring the protection settings of all network lines does not cause the\nmost cascading. More surprisingly, even when the degree of misconfiguration is\nlimited due to resource constraints, it is still possible to find settings that\nproduce cascades comparable in severity to instances where there are no\nresource constraints.",

Researchers have achieved promising results in leveraging ECGs in\nclinical applications with deep learning models.

In this work, we propose a novel ECG-Segment based\nLearning (ECG-SL) framework to explicitly model the periodic nature of ECG\nsignals. More specifically, ECG signals are first split into heartbeat\nsegments, and then structural features are extracted from each of the segments.\nBased on the structural features, a temporal model is designed to learn the\ntemporal information for various clinical tasks. Further, due to the fact that\nmassive ECG signals are available but the labeled data are very limited, we\nalso explore self-supervised learning strategy to pre-train the models,\nresulting significant improvement for downstream tasks. The proposed method\noutperforms the baseline model and shows competitive performances compared with\ntask-specific methods in three clinical applications: cardiac condition\ndiagnosis, sleep apnea detection, and arrhythmia classification. Further, we\nfind that the ECG-SL tends to focus more on each heartbeat's peak and ST range\nthan ResNet by visualizing the saliency maps.",

Despite the fact that these models learn representations of\nthe same modality of peptides, we find that they explain their predictions\ndifferently. Considering sequential and graphical models as two experts making\ninferences from different perspectives, we work on fusing expert knowledge to\nenrich the learned representations for improving the discriminative\nperformance. To achieve this, we propose a peptide co-modeling method, RepCon,\nwhich employs a contrastive learning-based framework to enhance the mutual\ninformation of representations from decoupled sequential and graphical\nend-to-end models. It considers representations from the sequential encoder and\nthe graphical encoder for the same peptide sample as a positive pair and learns\nto enhance the consistency of representations between positive sample pairs and\nto repel representations between negative pairs. Empirical studies of RepCon\nand other co-modeling methods are conducted on open-source discriminative\ndatasets, including aggregation propensity, retention time, antimicrobial\npeptide prediction, and family classification from Peptide Database. Our\nresults demonstrate the superiority of the co-modeling approach over\nindependent modeling, as well as the superiority of RepCon over other methods\nunder the co-modeling framework. In addition, the attribution on RepCon further\ncorroborates the validity of the approach at the level of model explanation.",

In\nthis setting, users design heuristics that provide noisy labels for subsets of\nthe data. These weak labels are combined (typically via a graphical model) to\nform pseudolabels, which are then used to train a downstream model. In this\nwork, we question a foundational premise of the typical weakly supervised\nlearning pipeline: given that the heuristic provides all ``label\" information,\nwhy do we need to generate pseudolabels at all? Instead, we propose to directly\ntransform the heuristics themselves into corresponding loss functions that\npenalize differences between our model and the heuristic. By constructing\nlosses directly from the heuristics, we can incorporate more information than\nis used in the standard weakly supervised pipeline, such as how the heuristics\nmake their decisions, which explicitly informs feature selection during\ntraining. We call our method Losses over Labels (LoL) as it creates losses\ndirectly from heuristics without going through the intermediate step of a\nlabel.

LMs can then be tailored\nto different preferences using multi-objective RL (MORL) with different reward\nweightings.

Essentially, MODPO trains different LMs to represent\ndifferent collective reward models that combine all objectives with specific\nweightings. With a simple cross-entropy loss, the LMs optimized against the\nMODPO objective are analytically the exact solutions of the original MORLHF\nobjective.

When optimizing for\nhelpfulness, RLHF has been consistently observed to drive models to produce\nlonger outputs. This paper demonstrates that optimizing for response length is\na significant factor behind RLHF's reported improvements in these settings.\nFirst, we study the relationship between reward and length for reward models\ntrained on three open-source preference datasets for helpfulness. Here, length\ncorrelates strongly with reward, and improvements in reward score are driven in\nlarge part by shifting the distribution over output lengths. We then explore\ninterventions during both RL and reward model learning to see if we can achieve\nthe same downstream improvements as RLHF without increasing length. While our\ninterventions mitigate length increases, they aren't uniformly effective across\nsettings. Furthermore, we find that even running RLHF with a reward based\nsolely on length can reproduce most of the downstream improvements over the\ninitial policy model, showing that reward models in these settings have a long\nway to go.",

We prove that on smooth non-convex objectives, 1) centralized\nFL (CFL) always generalizes better than decentralized FL (DFL); 2) from\nperspectives of the excess risk and test error in CFL, adopting partial\nparticipation is superior to full participation; and, 3) there is a necessary\nrequirement for the topology in DFL to avoid performance collapse as the\ntraining scale increases. Based on some simple hardware metrics, we could\nevaluate which framework is better in practice. Extensive experiments are\nconducted on common setups in FL to validate that our theoretical analysis is\ncontextually valid in practical scenarios.",

          "description": "The way users acquire information is undergoing a paradigm shift with the\nadvent of ChatGPT. Unlike conventional search engines, ChatGPT retrieves\nknowledge from the model itself and generates answers for users. ChatGPT's\nimpressive question-answering (QA) capability has attracted more than 100\nmillion users within a short period of time but has also raised concerns\nregarding its reliability. In this paper, we perform the first large-scale\nmeasurement of ChatGPT's reliability in the generic QA scenario with a\ncarefully curated set of 5,695 questions across ten datasets and eight domains.\nWe find that ChatGPT's reliability varies across different domains, especially\nunderperforming in law and science questions. We also demonstrate that system\nroles, originally designed by OpenAI to allow users to steer ChatGPT's\nbehavior, can impact ChatGPT's reliability in an imperceptible way. We further\nshow that ChatGPT is vulnerable to adversarial examples, and even a single\ncharacter change can negatively affect its reliability in certain cases. We\nbelieve that our study provides valuable insights into ChatGPT's reliability\nand underscores the need for strengthening the reliability and security of\nlarge language models (LLMs).",

          "description": "A broad current application of algorithms is in formal and quantitative\nmeasures of murky concepts -- like merit -- to make decisions. When people\nstrategically respond to these sorts of evaluations in order to gain favorable\ndecision outcomes, their behavior can be subjected to moral judgments. They may\nbe described as 'gaming the system' or 'cheating,' or (in other cases)\ninvesting 'honest effort' or 'improving.' Machine learning literature on\nstrategic behavior has tried to describe these dynamics by emphasizing the\nefforts expended by decision subjects hoping to obtain a more favorable\nassessment -- some works offer ways to preempt or prevent such manipulations,\nsome differentiate 'gaming' from 'improvement' behavior, while others aim to\nmeasure the effort burden or disparate effects of classification systems. We\nbegin from a different starting point: that the design of an evaluation itself\ncan be understood as furthering goals held by the evaluator which may be\nmisaligned with broader societal goals. To develop the idea that evaluation\nrepresents a strategic interaction in which both the evaluator and the subject\nof their evaluation are operating out of self-interest, we put forward a model\nthat represents the process of evaluation using three interacting agents: a\ndecision subject, an evaluator, and society, representing a bundle of values\nand oversight mechanisms. We highlight our model's applicability to a number of\nsocial systems where one or two players strategically undermine the others'\ninterests to advance their own. Treating evaluators as themselves strategic\nallows us to re-cast the scrutiny directed at decision subjects, towards the\nincentives that underpin institutional designs of evaluations. The moral\nstanding of strategic behaviors often depend on the moral standing of the\nevaluations and incentives that provoke such behaviors.",

However, even though neural network-based\nconstitutive laws have been shown to generalize proficiently, the generated\nrepresentations are not easily interpretable due to their high number of\ntrainable parameters. Sparse regression approaches exist that allow to\nobtaining interpretable expressions, but the user is tasked with creating a\nlibrary of model forms which by construction limits their expressiveness to the\nfunctional forms provided in the libraries. In this work, we propose to train\nregularized physics-augmented neural network-based constitutive models\nutilizing a smoothed version of $L^{0}$-regularization. This aims to maintain\nthe trustworthiness inherited by the physical constraints, but also enables\ninterpretability which has not been possible thus far on any type of machine\nlearning-based constitutive model where model forms were not assumed a-priory\nbut were actually discovered. During the training process, the network\nsimultaneously fits the training data and penalizes the number of active\nparameters, while also ensuring constitutive constraints such as thermodynamic\nconsistency.

However, due to the\nrandomness introduced in the reverse process of diffusion models, the\nperformances of diffusion-based SR models are fluctuating at every time of\nsampling, especially for samplers with few resampled steps. This inherent\nrandomness of diffusion models results in ineffectiveness and instability,\nmaking it challenging for users to guarantee the quality of SR results.\nHowever, our work takes this randomness as an opportunity: fully analyzing and\nleveraging it leads to the construction of an effective plug-and-play sampling\nmethod that owns the potential to benefit a series of diffusion-based SR\nmethods. More in detail, we propose to steadily sample high-quality SR images\nfrom pre-trained diffusion-based SR models by solving diffusion ordinary\ndifferential equations (diffusion ODEs) with optimal boundary conditions (BCs)\nand analyze the characteristics between the choices of BCs and their\ncorresponding SR results. Our analysis shows the route to obtain an\napproximately optimal BC via an efficient exploration in the whole space. The\nquality of SR results sampled by the proposed method with fewer steps\noutperforms the quality of results sampled by current methods with randomness\nfrom the same pre-trained diffusion-based SR model, which means that our\nsampling method \"boosts\" current diffusion-based SR models without any\nadditional training.",

          "description": "Due to the large-scale availability of data, machine learning (ML) algorithms\nare being deployed in distributed topologies, where different nodes collaborate\nto train ML models over their individual data by exchanging model-related\ninformation (e.g., gradients) with a central server. However, distributed\nlearning schemes are notably vulnerable to two threats. First, Byzantine nodes\ncan single-handedly corrupt the learning by sending incorrect information to\nthe server, e.g., erroneous gradients. The standard approach to mitigate such\nbehavior is to use a non-linear robust aggregation method at the server.\nSecond, the server can violate the privacy of the nodes. Recent attacks have\nshown that exchanging (unencrypted) gradients enables a curious server to\nrecover the totality of the nodes' data. The use of homomorphic encryption\n(HE), a gold standard security primitive, has extensively been studied as a\nprivacy-preserving solution to distributed learning in non-Byzantine scenarios.\nHowever, due to HE's large computational demand especially for high-dimensional\nML models, there has not yet been any attempt to design purely homomorphic\noperators for non-linear robust aggregators. In this work, we present SABLE,\nthe first completely homomorphic and Byzantine robust distributed learning\nalgorithm. SABLE essentially relies on a novel plaintext encoding method that\nenables us to implement the robust aggregator over batching-friendly BGV.\nMoreover, this encoding scheme also accelerates state-of-the-art homomorphic\nsorting with larger security margins and smaller ciphertext size.

          "description": "Self-play (SP) is a popular multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL)\nframework for solving competitive games, where each agent optimizes policy by\ntreating others as part of the environment. Despite the empirical successes,\nthe theoretical properties of SP-based methods are limited to two-player\nzero-sum games. However, for mixed cooperative-competitive games where agents\non the same team need to cooperate with each other, we can show a simple\ncounter-example where SP-based methods cannot converge to a global Nash\nequilibrium (NE) with high probability. Alternatively, Policy-Space Response\nOracles (PSRO) is an iterative framework for learning NE, where the best\nresponses w.r.t. previous policies are learned in each iteration. PSRO can be\ndirectly extended to mixed cooperative-competitive settings by jointly learning\nteam best responses with all convergence properties unchanged. However, PSRO\nrequires repeatedly training joint policies from scratch till convergence,\nwhich makes it hard to scale to complex games. In this work, we develop a novel\nalgorithm, Fictitious Cross-Play (FXP), which inherits the benefits from both\nframeworks. FXP simultaneously trains an SP-based main policy and a counter\npopulation of best response policies. The main policy is trained by fictitious\nself-play and cross-play against the counter population, while the counter\npolicies are trained as the best responses to the main policy's past versions.\nWe validate our method in matrix games and show that FXP converges to global\nNEs while SP methods fail. We also conduct experiments in a gridworld domain,\nwhere FXP achieves higher Elo ratings and lower exploitabilities than\nbaselines, and a more challenging football game, where FXP defeats SOTA models\nwith over 94% win rate.",

          "description": "Multi-objective learning (MOL) problems often arise in emerging machine\nlearning problems when there are multiple learning criteria, data modalities,\nor learning tasks. Different from single-objective learning, one of the\ncritical challenges in MOL is the potential conflict among different objectives\nduring the iterative optimization process. Recent works have developed various\ndynamic weighting algorithms for MOL such as MGDA and its variants, where the\ncentral idea is to find an update direction that avoids conflicts among\nobjectives. Albeit its appealing intuition, empirical studies show that dynamic\nweighting methods may not always outperform static ones. To understand this\ntheory-practical gap, we focus on a new stochastic variant of MGDA - the\nMulti-objective gradient with Double sampling (MoDo) algorithm, and study the\ngeneralization performance of the dynamic weighting-based MoDo and its\ninterplay with optimization through the lens of algorithm stability. Perhaps\nsurprisingly, we find that the key rationale behind MGDA -- updating along\nconflict-avoidant direction - may hinder dynamic weighting algorithms from\nachieving the optimal ${\\cal O}(1/\\sqrt{n})$ population risk, where $n$ is the\nnumber of training samples. We further demonstrate the impact of the\nvariability of dynamic weights on the three-way trade-off among optimization,\ngeneralization, and conflict avoidance that is unique in MOL. We showcase the\ngenerality of our theoretical framework by analyzing other existing stochastic\nMOL algorithms under the framework. Experiments on various multi-task learning\nbenchmarks are performed to demonstrate the practical applicability. Code is\navailable at https://github.com/heshandevaka/Trade-Off-MOL.",

          "description": "Generative Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable results\nfor a wide range of tasks. However, deploying these models for inference has\nbeen a significant challenge due to their unprecedented resource requirements.\nThis has forced existing deployment frameworks to use multi-GPU inference\npipelines, which are often complex and costly, or to use smaller and less\nperformant models. In this work, we demonstrate that the main bottleneck for\ngenerative inference with LLMs is memory bandwidth, rather than compute,\nspecifically for single batch inference. While quantization has emerged as a\npromising solution by representing model weights with reduced precision,\nprevious efforts have often resulted in notable performance degradation. To\naddress this, we introduce SqueezeLLM, a post-training quantization framework\nthat not only enables lossless compression to ultra-low precisions of up to\n3-bit, but also achieves higher quantization performance under the same memory\nconstraint. Our framework incorporates two novel ideas: (i) sensitivity-based\nnon-uniform quantization, which searches for the optimal bit precision\nassignment based on second-order information; and (ii) the Dense-and-Sparse\ndecomposition that stores outliers and sensitive weight values in an efficient\nsparse format. When applied to the LLaMA models, our 3-bit quantization\nsignificantly reduces the perplexity gap from the FP16 baseline by up to 2.1x\nas compared to the state-of-the-art methods with the same memory requirement.\nFurthermore, when deployed on an A6000 GPU, our quantized models achieve up to\n2.3x speedup compared to the baseline.

Numerous\nstudies have implemented structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to model\nAD progression, focusing on three integral aspects: (i) temporal variability,\n(ii) incomplete observations, and (iii) temporal geometric characteristics.\nHowever, deep learning-based approaches regarding data variability and sparsity\nhave yet to consider inherent geometrical properties sufficiently. The ordinary\ndifferential equation-based geometric modeling method (ODE-RGRU) has recently\nemerged as a promising strategy for modeling time-series data by intertwining a\nrecurrent neural network and an ODE in Riemannian space. Despite its\nachievements, ODE-RGRU encounters limitations when extrapolating positive\ndefinite symmetric metrics from incomplete samples, leading to feature reverse\noccurrences that are particularly problematic, especially within the clinical\nfacet. Therefore, this study proposes a novel geometric learning approach that\nmodels longitudinal MRI biomarkers and cognitive scores by combining three\nmodules: topological space shift, ODE-RGRU, and trajectory estimation. We have\nalso developed a training algorithm that integrates manifold mapping with\nmonotonicity constraints to reflect measurement transition irreversibility.

DeepHGCN presents two key\nenablers of deep HGCNs: (1) a novel hyperbolic feature transformation layer\nthat enables fast and accurate linear maps; and (2) Techniques such as\nhyperbolic residual connections and regularization for both weights and\nfeatures facilitated by an efficient hyperbolic midpoint method. Extensive\nexperiments demonstrate that DeepHGCN obtains significant improvements in link\nprediction and node classification tasks compared to both Euclidean and shallow\nhyperbolic GCN variants.",

          "description": "Existing approaches to algorithmic fairness aim to ensure equitable outcomes\nif human decision-makers comply perfectly with algorithmic decisions. However,\nperfect compliance with the algorithm is rarely a reality or even a desirable\noutcome in human-AI collaboration. Yet, recent studies have shown that\nselective compliance with fair algorithms can amplify discrimination relative\nto the prior human policy. As a consequence, ensuring equitable outcomes\nrequires fundamentally different algorithmic design principles that ensure\nrobustness to the decision-maker's (a priori unknown) compliance pattern. We\ndefine the notion of compliance-robustly fair algorithmic recommendations that\nare guaranteed to (weakly) improve fairness in decisions, regardless of the\nhuman's compliance pattern. We propose a simple optimization strategy to\nidentify the best performance-improving compliance-robustly fair policy.\nHowever, we show that it may be infeasible to design algorithmic\nrecommendations that are simultaneously fair in isolation, compliance-robustly\nfair, and more accurate than the human policy; thus, if our goal is to improve\nthe equity and accuracy of human-AI collaboration, it may not be desirable to\nenforce traditional fairness constraints.",

          "description": "Deep neural network (DNN) models have become increasingly crucial components\nin intelligent software systems. However, training a DNN model is typically\nexpensive in terms of both time and money. To address this issue, researchers\nhave recently focused on reusing existing DNN models - borrowing the idea of\ncode reuse in software engineering. However, reusing an entire model could\ncause extra overhead or inherits the weakness from the undesired\nfunctionalities. Hence, existing work proposes to decompose an already trained\nmodel into modules, i.e., modularizing-after-training, and enable module reuse.\nSince trained models are not built for modularization,\nmodularizing-after-training incurs huge overhead and model accuracy loss. In\nthis paper, we propose a novel approach that incorporates modularization into\nthe model training process, i.e., modularizing-while-training (MwT). We train a\nmodel to be structurally modular through two loss functions that optimize\nintra-module cohesion and inter-module coupling. We have implemented the\nproposed approach for modularizing Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models in\nthis work. The evaluation results on representative models demonstrate that MwT\noutperforms the state-of-the-art approach. Specifically, the accuracy loss\ncaused by MwT is only 1.13 percentage points, which is 1.76 percentage points\nless than that of the baseline. The kernel retention rate of the modules\ngenerated by MwT is only 14.58%, with a reduction of 74.31% over the\nstate-of-the-art approach. Furthermore, the total time cost required for\ntraining and modularizing is only 108 minutes, half of the baseline.",

Among the methods used for gait analysis,\nskeleton-based approaches have shown promise due to their robust and\ninterpretable features.

By employing the Straight-Through Gumbel-Softmax trick, our model\nis trainable end-to-end. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on\nthe CASIA-B dataset for gait-based gender estimation.

These algorithms enable dynamic\nscaling of given transformer-based FMs to fit heterogeneous resource\nconstraints at the network edge during both FL's optimization and deployment\nstages. Experimental results demonstrate that RaFFM shows significant\nsuperiority in resource utilization efficiency and uses fewer resources to\ndeploy FMs to FL.

Representation learning\nmethods have often used unsupervised learning to segment an input image into\nindividual objects and encode these objects into each latent vector. However,\nit is not clear how previous methods have achieved the appropriate segmentation\nof individual objects. Additionally, most of the previous methods regularize\nthe latent vectors using a Variational Autoencoder (VAE). Therefore, it is not\nclear whether VAE regularization contributes to appropriate object\nsegmentation. To elucidate the mechanism of object segmentation in multi-object\nrepresentation learning, we conducted an ablation study on MONet, which is a\ntypical method. MONet represents multiple objects using pairs that consist of\nan attention mask and the latent vector corresponding to the attention mask.\nEach latent vector is encoded from the input image and attention mask. Then,\nthe component image and attention mask are decoded from each latent vector. The\nloss function of MONet consists of 1) the sum of reconstruction losses between\nthe input image and decoded component image, 2) the VAE regularization loss of\nthe latent vector, and 3) the reconstruction loss of the attention mask to\nexplicitly encode shape information. We conducted an ablation study on these\nthree loss functions to investigate the effect on segmentation performance. Our\nresults showed that the VAE regularization loss did not affect segmentation\nperformance and the others losses did affect it. Based on this result, we\nhypothesize that it is important to maximize the attention mask of the image\nregion best represented by a single latent vector corresponding to the\nattention mask. We confirmed this hypothesis by evaluating a new loss function\nwith the same mechanism as the hypothesis.",

          "description": "Foundation models (FMs) are able to leverage large volumes of unlabeled data\nto demonstrate superior performance across a wide range of tasks. However, FMs\ndeveloped for biomedical domains have largely remained unimodal, i.e.,\nindependently trained and used for tasks on protein sequences alone, small\nmolecule structures alone, or clinical data alone. To overcome this limitation\nof biomedical FMs, we present BioBridge, a novel parameter-efficient learning\nframework, to bridge independently trained unimodal FMs to establish multimodal\nbehavior. BioBridge achieves it by utilizing Knowledge Graphs (KG) to learn\ntransformations between one unimodal FM and another without fine-tuning any\nunderlying unimodal FMs. Our empirical results demonstrate that BioBridge can\nbeat the best baseline KG embedding methods (on average by around 76.3%) in\ncross-modal retrieval tasks. We also identify BioBridge demonstrates\nout-of-domain generalization ability by extrapolating to unseen modalities or\nrelations. Additionally, we also show that BioBridge presents itself as a\ngeneral purpose retriever that can aid biomedical multimodal question answering\nas well as enhance the guided generation of novel drugs.",

          "description": "Deep learning methods have been successfully used in various computer vision\ntasks. Inspired by that success, deep learning has been explored in magnetic\nresonance imaging (MRI) reconstruction. In particular, integrating deep\nlearning and model-based optimization methods has shown considerable\nadvantages. However, a large amount of labeled training data is typically\nneeded for high reconstruction quality, which is challenging for some MRI\napplications. In this paper, we propose a novel reconstruction method, named\nDURED-Net, that enables interpretable self-supervised learning for MR image\nreconstruction by combining a self-supervised denoising network and a\nplug-and-play method. We aim to boost the reconstruction performance of\nNoise2Noise in MR reconstruction by adding an explicit prior that utilizes\nimaging physics. Specifically, the leverage of a denoising network for MRI\nreconstruction is achieved using Regularization by Denoising (RED).

          "description": "Deep learning models based on resting-state functional magnetic resonance\nimaging (rs-fMRI) have been widely used to diagnose brain diseases,\nparticularly autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Existing studies have leveraged\nthe functional connectivity (FC) of rs-fMRI, achieving notable classification\nperformance. However, they have significant limitations, including the lack of\nadequate information while using linear low-order FC as inputs to the model,\nnot considering individual characteristics (i.e., different symptoms or varying\nstages of severity) among patients with ASD, and the non-explainability of the\ndecision process. To cover these limitations, we propose a novel\nexplainability-guided region of interest (ROI) selection (EAG-RS) framework\nthat identifies non-linear high-order functional associations among brain\nregions by leveraging an explainable artificial intelligence technique and\nselects class-discriminative regions for brain disease identification. The\nproposed framework includes three steps: (i) inter-regional relation learning\nto estimate non-linear relations through random seed-based network masking,\n(ii) explainable connection-wise relevance score estimation to explore\nhigh-order relations between functional connections, and (iii) non-linear\nhigh-order FC-based diagnosis-informative ROI selection and classifier learning\nto identify ASD. We validated the effectiveness of our proposed method by\nconducting experiments using the Autism Brain Imaging Database Exchange (ABIDE)\ndataset, demonstrating that the proposed method outperforms other comparative\nmethods in terms of various evaluation metrics.

To this end, we first collected 3392 cervical ultrasound images\ncontaining normal lymph nodes, benign lymph node lesions, malignant primary\nlymph node lesions, and malignant metastatic lymph node lesions. Given that\nultrasound images are generated by the reflection and scattering of sound waves\nacross varied bodily tissues, we proposed the Conv-FFT Block.

To ascertain the potential of\nSFUSNet, we benchmarked it against 12 popular architectures through five-fold\ncross-validation. The results show that SFUSNet is the state-of-the-art model\nand can achieve 92.89% accuracy.

Many optimization algorithms for minimax problems\nhave been developed in the centralized setting (\\emph{i.e.} single-machine).\nNonetheless, the algorithm for minimax problems under FL is still\nunderexplored.

The structure of this joint distribution should\nidentify multi-way correspondences among the prescribed marginals. We formalize\nan approach to this task within a generalization of the stochastic interpolant\nframework, leading to efficient learning algorithms built upon dynamical\ntransport of measure. Our generative models are defined by velocity and score\nfields that can be characterized as the minimizers of simple quadratic\nobjectives, and they are defined on a simplex that generalizes the time\nvariable in the usual dynamical transport framework. The resulting transport on\nthe simplex is influenced by all marginals, and we show that multi-way\ncorrespondences can be extracted. The identification of such correspondences\nhas applications to style transfer, algorithmic fairness, and data\ndecorruption. In addition, the multimarginal perspective enables an efficient\nalgorithm for reducing the dynamical transport cost in the ordinary\ntwo-marginal setting.

The method, which we call\nLandscape-Sketch-and-Step (LSS), combines Machine Learning, Stochastic\nOptimization, and Reinforcement Learning techniques, relying on historical\ninformation from previously sampled points to make judicious choices of\nparameter values where the cost function should be evaluated at. Unlike\noptimization by Replica Exchange Monte Carlo methods, the number of evaluations\nof the cost function required in this approach is comparable to that used by\nSimulated Annealing, quality that is especially important in contexts like\nhigh-throughput computing or high-performance computing tasks, where\nevaluations are either computationally expensive or take a long time to be\nperformed. The method also differs from standard Surrogate Optimization\ntechniques, for it does not construct a surrogate model that aims at\napproximating or reconstructing the objective function. We illustrate our\nmethod by applying it to low dimensional optimization problems (dimensions 1,\n2, 4, and 8) that mimick known difficulties of minimization on rugged energy\nlandscapes often seen in Condensed Matter Physics, where cost functions are\nrugged and plagued with local minima. When compared to classical Simulated\nAnnealing, the LSS shows an effective acceleration of the optimization process.",

In addition, we investigate deep learning\napproaches, making design choices to tackle the particular challenges of this\ntask. The new method is evaluated on a large-scale retrospective scenario,\nbased on concepts that have been promoted to descriptors. Results: In our\nexperiments concept occurrence was the strongest heuristic achieving a macro-F1\nscore of about 0.63 across several labels.

We find that the network can shift the initial distribution\nof properties of the quantum system, and we can conceptualize the learned\nstrategies of the neural network.

          "description": "Reinforcement Learning (RL) methods are typically sample-inefficient, making\nit challenging to train and deploy RL-policies in real world robots. Even a\nrobust policy trained in simulation requires a real-world deployment to assess\ntheir performance. This paper proposes a new approach to evaluate the\nreal-world performance of agent policies prior to deploying them in the real\nworld. Our approach incorporates a simulator along with real-world offline data\nto evaluate the performance of any policy using the framework of Marginalized\nImportance Sampling (MIS). Existing MIS methods face two challenges: (1) large\ndensity ratios that deviate from a reasonable range and (2) indirect\nsupervision, where the ratio needs to be inferred indirectly, thus exacerbating\nestimation error. Our approach addresses these challenges by introducing the\ntarget policy's occupancy in the simulator as an intermediate variable and\nlearning the density ratio as the product of two terms that can be learned\nseparately. The first term is learned with direct supervision and the second\nterm has a small magnitude, thus making it computationally efficient. We\nanalyze the sample complexity as well as error propagation of our two\nstep-procedure. Furthermore, we empirically evaluate our approach on Sim2Sim\nenvironments such as Cartpole, Reacher, and Half-Cheetah. Our results show that\nour method generalizes well across a variety of Sim2Sim gap, target policies\nand offline data collection policies. We also demonstrate the performance of\nour algorithm on a Sim2Real task of validating the performance of a 7 DoF\nrobotic arm using offline data along with the Gazebo simulator.",

          "description": "Like generic multi-task learning, continual learning has the nature of\nmulti-objective optimization, and therefore faces a trade-off between the\nperformance of different tasks. That is, to optimize for the current task\ndistribution, it may need to compromise performance on some previous tasks.\nThis means that there exist multiple models that are Pareto-optimal at\ndifferent times, each addressing a distinct task performance trade-off.\nResearchers have discussed how to train particular models to address specific\ntrade-off preferences. However, existing algorithms require training overheads\nproportional to the number of preferences -- a large burden when there are\nmultiple, possibly infinitely many, preferences. As a response, we propose\nImprecise Bayesian Continual Learning (IBCL). Upon a new task, IBCL (1) updates\na knowledge base in the form of a convex hull of model parameter distributions\nand (2) obtains particular models to address task trade-off preferences with\nzero-shot. That is, IBCL does not require any additional training overhead to\ngenerate preference-addressing models from its knowledge base. We show that\nmodels obtained by IBCL have guarantees in identifying the Pareto optimal\nparameters. Moreover, experiments on standard image classification and NLP\ntasks support this guarantee. Statistically, IBCL improves average per-task\naccuracy by at most 23\\% and peak per-task accuracy by at most 15\\% with\nrespect to the baseline methods, with steadily near-zero or positive backward\ntransfer. Most importantly, IBCL significantly reduces the training overhead\nfrom training 1 model per preference to at most 3 models for all preferences.",

Our defense falls within the category of post-development defenses\nthat operate independently of how the model was generated. The proposed defense\nis built upon a novel reverse engineering approach that can directly extract\nbackdoor functionality of a given backdoored model to a backdoor expert model.\nThe approach is straightforward -- finetuning the backdoored model over a small\nset of intentionally mislabeled clean samples, such that it unlearns the normal\nfunctionality while still preserving the backdoor functionality, and thus\nresulting in a model (dubbed a backdoor expert model) that can only recognize\nbackdoor inputs. Based on the extracted backdoor expert model, we show the\nfeasibility of devising highly accurate backdoor input detectors that filter\nout the backdoor inputs during model inference. Further augmented by an\nensemble strategy with a finetuned auxiliary model, our defense, BaDExpert\n(Backdoor Input Detection with Backdoor Expert), effectively mitigates 17 SOTA\nbackdoor attacks while minimally impacting clean utility.

To mitigate this issue, there has been a\nsurge of interest in explainable AI (XAI) techniques, capable of pinpointing\nthe input features that caused the DNN to act as it did. Existing XAI\ntechniques typically face two limitations: (i) they are heuristic, and do not\nprovide formal guarantees that the explanations are correct; and (ii) they\noften apply to ``one-shot'' systems, where the DNN is invoked independently of\npast invocations, as opposed to reactive systems. Here, we begin bridging this\ngap, and propose a formal DNN-verification-based XAI technique for reasoning\nabout multi-step, reactive systems. We suggest methods for efficiently\ncalculating succinct explanations, by exploiting the system's transition\nconstraints in order to curtail the search space explored by the underlying\nverifier. We evaluate our approach on two popular benchmarks from the domain of\nautomated navigation; and observe that our methods allow the efficient\ncomputation of minimal and minimum explanations, significantly outperforming\nthe state of the art.

          "description": "Learning from crowds describes that the annotations of training data are\nobtained with crowd-sourcing services. Multiple annotators each complete their\nown small part of the annotations, where labeling mistakes that depend on\nannotators occur frequently. Modeling the label-noise generation process by the\nnoise transition matrix is a power tool to tackle the label noise. In\nreal-world crowd-sourcing scenarios, noise transition matrices are both\nannotator- and instance-dependent. However, due to the high complexity of\nannotator- and instance-dependent transition matrices (AIDTM), annotation\nsparsity, which means each annotator only labels a little part of instances,\nmakes modeling AIDTM very challenging. Prior works simplify the problem by\nassuming the transition matrix is instance-independent or using simple\nparametric ways, which lose modeling generality. Motivated by this, we target a\nmore realistic problem, estimating general AIDTM in practice. Without losing\nmodeling generality, we parameterize AIDTM with deep neural networks. To\nalleviate the modeling challenge, we suppose every annotator shares its noise\npattern with similar annotators, and estimate AIDTM via knowledge transfer. We\nhence first model the mixture of noise patterns by all annotators, and then\ntransfer this modeling to individual annotators. Furthermore, considering that\nthe transfer from the mixture of noise patterns to individuals may cause two\nannotators with highly different noise generations to perturb each other, we\nemploy the knowledge transfer between identified neighboring annotators to\ncalibrate the modeling. Theoretical analyses are derived to demonstrate that\nboth the knowledge transfer from global to individuals and the knowledge\ntransfer between neighboring individuals can help model general AIDTM.\nExperiments confirm the superiority of the proposed approach on synthetic and\nreal-world crowd-sourcing data.",

          "description": "Toward robust malware detection, we explore the attack surface of existing\nmalware detection systems. We conduct root-cause analyses of the practical\nbinary-level black-box adversarial malware examples. Additionally, we uncover\nthe sensitivity of volatile features within the detection engines and exhibit\ntheir exploitability. Highlighting volatile information channels within the\nsoftware, we introduce three software pre-processing steps to eliminate the\nattack surface, namely, padding removal, software stripping, and inter-section\ninformation resetting. Further, to counter the emerging section injection\nattacks, we propose a graph-based section-dependent information extraction\nscheme for software representation. The proposed scheme leverages aggregated\ninformation within various sections in the software to enable robust malware\ndetection and mitigate adversarial settings. Our experimental results show that\ntraditional malware detection models are ineffective against adversarial\nthreats. However, the attack surface can be largely reduced by eliminating the\nvolatile information. Therefore, we propose simple-yet-effective methods to\nmitigate the impacts of binary manipulation attacks. Overall, our graph-based\nmalware detection scheme can accurately detect malware with an area under the\ncurve score of 88.32\\% and a score of 88.19% under a combination of binary\nmanipulation attacks, exhibiting the efficiency of our proposed scheme.",

          "description": "Graph-level anomaly detection has gained significant attention as it finds\nmany applications in various domains, such as cancer diagnosis and enzyme\nprediction. However, existing methods fail to capture the underlying properties\nof graph anomalies, resulting in unexplainable framework design and\nunsatisfying performance. In this paper, we take a step back and re-investigate\nthe spectral differences between anomalous and normal graphs. Our main\nobservation shows a significant disparity in the accumulated spectral energy\nbetween these two classes. Moreover, we prove that the accumulated spectral\nenergy of the graph signal can be represented by its Rayleigh Quotient,\nindicating that the Rayleigh Quotient is a driving factor behind the anomalous\nproperties of graphs. Motivated by this, we propose Rayleigh Quotient Graph\nNeural Network (RQGNN), the first spectral GNN for graph-level anomaly\ndetection, providing a new perspective on exploring the inherent spectral\nfeatures of anomalous graphs. Specifically, we introduce a novel framework that\nconsists of two components: the Rayleigh Quotient learning component (RQL) and\nChebyshev Wavelet GNN with RQ-pooling (CWGNN-RQ). RQL explicitly captures the\nRayleigh Quotient of graphs and CWGNN-RQ implicitly explores the spectral space\nof graphs. Extensive experiments on 10 real-world datasets show that RQGNN\noutperforms the best rival by 6.74% in Macro-F1 score and 1.44% in AUC,\ndemonstrating the effectiveness of our framework.",

          "description": "Sampling a target probability distribution with an unknown normalization\nconstant is a fundamental challenge in computational science and engineering.\nRecent work shows that algorithms derived by considering gradient flows in the\nspace of probability measures open up new avenues for algorithm development.\nThis paper makes three contributions to this sampling approach by scrutinizing\nthe design components of such gradient flows. Any instantiation of a gradient\nflow for sampling needs an energy functional and a metric to determine the\nflow, as well as numerical approximations of the flow to derive algorithms. Our\nfirst contribution is to show that the Kullback-Leibler divergence, as an\nenergy functional, has the unique property (among all f-divergences) that\ngradient flows resulting from it do not depend on the normalization constant of\nthe target distribution. Our second contribution is to study the choice of\nmetric from the perspective of invariance. The Fisher-Rao metric is known as\nthe unique choice (up to scaling) that is diffeomorphism invariant. As a\ncomputationally tractable alternative, we introduce a relaxed, affine\ninvariance property for the metrics and gradient flows. In particular, we\nconstruct various affine invariant Wasserstein and Stein gradient flows. Affine\ninvariant gradient flows are shown to behave more favorably than their\nnon-affine-invariant counterparts when sampling highly anisotropic\ndistributions, in theory and by using particle methods. Our third contribution\nis to study, and develop efficient algorithms based on Gaussian approximations\nof the gradient flows; this leads to an alternative to particle methods. We\nestablish connections between various Gaussian approximate gradient flows,\ndiscuss their relation to gradient methods arising from parametric variational\ninference, and study their convergence properties both theoretically and\nnumerically.",

          "description": "A myriad of approaches have been proposed to characterise the mesoscale\nstructure of networks - most often as a partition based on patterns variously\ncalled communities, blocks, or clusters. Clearly, distinct methods designed to\ndetect different types of patterns may provide a variety of answers to the\nnetwork's mesoscale structure. Yet, even multiple runs of a given method can\nsometimes yield diverse and conflicting results, producing entire landscapes of\npartitions which potentially include multiple (locally optimal) mesoscale\nexplanations of the network. Such ambiguity motivates a closer look at the\nability of these methods to find multiple qualitatively different 'ground\ntruth' partitions in a network. Here, we propose the stochastic cross-block\nmodel (SCBM), a generative model which allows for two distinct partitions to be\nbuilt into the mesoscale structure of a single benchmark network. We\ndemonstrate a use case of the benchmark model by appraising the power of\nstochastic block models (SBMs) to detect implicitly planted coexisting\nbi-community and core-periphery structures of different strengths. Given our\nmodel design and experimental set-up, we find that the ability to detect the\ntwo partitions individually varies by SBM variant and that coexistence of both\npartitions is recovered only in a very limited number of cases. Our findings\nsuggest that in most instances only one - in some way dominating - structure\ncan be detected, even in the presence of other partitions. They underline the\nneed for considering entire landscapes of partitions when different competing\nexplanations exist and motivate future research to advance partition\ncoexistence detection methods. Our model also contributes to the field of\nbenchmark networks more generally by enabling further exploration of the\nability of new and existing methods to detect ambiguity in the mesoscale\nstructure of networks.",

However, it remains unclear\nhow this link is expressed in mathematical terms from image probability. First,\nclassical derivations were subjected to strong assumptions on the probability\nmodels and on the behaviour of the sensors. Moreover, the direct evaluation of\nthe hypothesis was limited by the inability of the classical image models to\ndeliver accurate estimates of the probability. In this work we directly\nevaluate image probabilities using an advanced generative model for natural\nimages, and we analyse how probability-related factors can be combined to\npredict human perception via sensitivity of state-of-the-art subjective image\nquality metrics. We use information theory and regression analysis to find a\ncombination of just two probability-related factors that achieves 0.8\ncorrelation with subjective metrics.

Unfortunately, this approach has\nthe drawback of increased training complexity since generating adversarial\nsamples is very computationally demanding. In contrast to ANNs, humans are not\nsusceptible to adversarial attacks. Therefore, in this work, we investigate\nwhether biologically-plausible learning algorithms are more robust against\nadversarial attacks than BP. In particular, we present an extensive comparative\nanalysis of the adversarial robustness of BP and Present the Error to Perturb\nthe Input To modulate Activity (PEPITA), a recently proposed\nbiologically-plausible learning algorithm, on various computer vision tasks. We\nobserve that PEPITA has higher intrinsic adversarial robustness and, with\nadversarial training, has a more favourable natural-vs-adversarial performance\ntrade-off as, for the same natural accuracies, PEPITA's adversarial accuracies\ndecrease in average by 0.26% and BP's by 8.05%.",

          "description": "Finetuned LLMs often exhibit poor uncertainty quantification, manifesting as\noverconfidence, poor calibration, and unreliable prediction results on test\ndata or out-of-distribution samples. One approach commonly used in vision for\nalleviating this issue is a deep ensemble, which constructs an ensemble by\ntraining the same model multiple times using different random initializations.\nHowever, there is a huge challenge to ensembling LLMs: the most effective LLMs\nare very, very large. Keeping a single LLM in memory is already challenging\nenough: keeping an ensemble of e.g. 5 LLMs in memory is impossible in many\nsettings. To address these issues, we propose an ensemble approach using\nLow-Rank Adapters (LoRA), a parameter-efficient fine-tuning technique.\nCritically, these low-rank adapters represent a very small number of\nparameters, orders of magnitude less than the underlying pre-trained model.\nThus, it is possible to construct large ensembles of LoRA adapters with almost\nthe same computational overhead as using the original model. We find that LoRA\nensembles, applied on its own or on top of pre-existing regularization\ntechniques, gives consistent improvements in predictive accuracy and\nuncertainty quantification.",

To this end, diverse approaches are proposed\nto improve data processing efficiency.

Although dataset distillation\nhas shown surprising performance in compressing datasets, there are still\nseveral limitations such as distilling high-resolution data or data with\ncomplex label spaces.

As a result, Adversarial Machine\nLearning (AdvML) has gained a lot of attention, and researchers have\ninvestigated these vulnerabilities in various settings and modalities. In\naddition, DNNs have also been found to incorporate embedded bias and often\nproduce unexplainable predictions, which can result in anti-social AI\napplications.

          "description": "Decoding speech from brain activity is a long-awaited goal in both healthcare\nand neuroscience. Invasive devices have recently led to major milestones in\nthat regard: deep learning algorithms trained on intracranial recordings now\nstart to decode elementary linguistic features (e.g. letters, words,\nspectrograms). However, extending this approach to natural speech and\nnon-invasive brain recordings remains a major challenge. Here, we introduce a\nmodel trained with contrastive-learning to decode self-supervised\nrepresentations of perceived speech from the non-invasive recordings of a large\ncohort of healthy individuals. To evaluate this approach, we curate and\nintegrate four public datasets, encompassing 175 volunteers recorded with\nmagneto- or electro-encephalography (M/EEG), while they listened to short\nstories and isolated sentences. The results show that our model can identify,\nfrom 3 seconds of MEG signals, the corresponding speech segment with up to 41%\naccuracy out of more than 1,000 distinct possibilities on average across\nparticipants, and more than 80% in the very best participants - a performance\nthat allows the decoding of words and phrases absent from the training set. The\ncomparison of our model to a variety of baselines highlights the importance of\n(i) a contrastive objective, (ii) pretrained representations of speech and\n(iii) a common convolutional architecture simultaneously trained across\nmultiple participants. Finally, the analysis of the decoder's predictions\nsuggests that they primarily depend on lexical and contextual semantic\nrepresentations. Overall, this effective decoding of perceived speech from\nnon-invasive recordings delineates a promising path to decode language from\nbrain activity, without putting patients at risk for brain surgery.",

In this\nwork, we propose the Unpaired Neural Schr\\\"odinger Bridge (UNSB), which\nexpresses SB problem as a sequence of adversarial learning problems. This\nallows us to incorporate advanced discriminators and regularization to learn a\nSB between unpaired data. We demonstrate that UNSB is scalable and successfully\nsolves various unpaired image-to-image translation tasks. Code:\n\\url{https://github.com/cyclomon/UNSB}",

          "description": "Machine learning algorithms have grown in sophistication over the years and\nare increasingly deployed for real-life applications. However, when using\nmachine learning techniques in practical settings, particularly in high-risk\napplications such as medicine and engineering, obtaining the failure\nprobability of the predictive model is critical. We refer to this problem as\nthe risk-assessment task. We focus on regression algorithms and the\nrisk-assessment task of computing the probability of the true label lying\ninside an interval defined around the model's prediction. We solve the\nrisk-assessment problem using the conformal prediction approach, which provides\nprediction intervals that are guaranteed to contain the true label with a given\nprobability. Using this coverage property, we prove that our approximated\nfailure probability is conservative in the sense that it is not lower than the\ntrue failure probability of the ML algorithm. We conduct extensive experiments\nto empirically study the accuracy of the proposed method for problems with and\nwithout covariate shift. Our analysis focuses on different modeling regimes,\ndataset sizes, and conformal prediction methodologies.",

While no model can work when data evolves in an arbitrary\nfashion, if there is some pattern to these changes, we might be able to design\nmethods to address it. This paper addresses situations when data evolves\ngradually. We introduce a time-varying propensity score that can detect gradual\nshifts in the distribution of data which allows us to selectively sample past\ndata to update the model -- not just similar data from the past like that of a\nstandard propensity score but also data that evolved in a similar fashion in\nthe past. The time-varying propensity score is quite general: we demonstrate\ndifferent ways of implementing it and evaluate it on a variety of problems\nranging from supervised learning (e.g., image classification problems) where\ndata undergoes a sequence of gradual shifts, to reinforcement learning tasks\n(e.g., robotic manipulation and continuous control) where data shifts as the\npolicy or the task changes.",

We develop theoretical guarantees for FA-LD for strongly log-concave\ndistributions with non-i.i.d data and study how the injected noise and the\nstochastic-gradient noise, the heterogeneity of data, and the varying learning\nrates affect the convergence. Such an analysis sheds light on the optimal\nchoice of local updates to minimize communication costs. Important to our\napproach is that the communication efficiency does not deteriorate with the\ninjected noise in the Langevin algorithms. In addition, we examine in our FA-LD\nalgorithm both independent and correlated noise used over different clients. We\nobserve there is a trade-off between the pairs among communication, accuracy,\nand data privacy. As local devices may become inactive in federated networks,\nwe also show convergence results based on different averaging schemes where\nonly partial device updates are available.

          "description": "There is a niche of companies responsible for intermediating the purchase of\nlarge batches of varied products for other companies, for which the main\nchallenge is to perform product description standardization, i.e., matching an\nitem described by a client with a product described in a catalog. The problem\nis complex since the client's product description may be: (1) potentially\nnoisy; (2) short and uninformative (e.g., missing information about model and\nsize); and (3) cross-language. In this paper, we formalize this problem as a\nranking task: given an initial client product specification (query), return the\nmost appropriate standardized descriptions (response). In this paper, we\npropose TPDR, a two-step Transformer-based Product and Class Description\nRetrieval method that is able to explore the semantic correspondence between IS\nand SD, by exploiting attention mechanisms and contrastive learning. First,\nTPDR employs the transformers as two encoders sharing the embedding vector\nspace: one for encoding the IS and another for the SD, in which corresponding\npairs (IS, SD) must be close in the vector space. Closeness is further enforced\nby a contrastive learning mechanism leveraging a specialized loss function.\nTPDR also exploits a (second) re-ranking step based on syntactic features that\nare very important for the exact matching (model, dimension) of certain\nproducts that may have been neglected by the transformers. To evaluate our\nproposal, we consider 11 datasets from a real company, covering different\napplication contexts. Our solution was able to retrieve the correct\nstandardized product before the 5th ranking position in 71% of the cases and\nits correct category in the first position in 80% of the situations. Moreover,\nthe effectiveness gains over purely syntactic or semantic baselines reach up to\n3.7 times, solving cases that none of the approaches in isolation can do by\nthemselves.",

          "description": "Generative Flow Networks (GFlowNets) are amortized samplers that learn\nstochastic policies to sequentially generate compositional objects from a given\nunnormalized reward distribution. They can generate diverse sets of high-reward\nobjects, which is an important consideration in scientific discovery tasks.\nHowever, as they are typically trained from a given extrinsic reward function,\nit remains an important open challenge about how to leverage the power of\npre-training and train GFlowNets in an unsupervised fashion for efficient\nadaptation to downstream tasks. Inspired by recent successes of unsupervised\npre-training in various domains, we introduce a novel approach for reward-free\npre-training of GFlowNets. By framing the training as a self-supervised\nproblem, we propose an outcome-conditioned GFlowNet (OC-GFN) that learns to\nexplore the candidate space. Specifically, OC-GFN learns to reach any targeted\noutcomes, akin to goal-conditioned policies in reinforcement learning. We show\nthat the pre-trained OC-GFN model can allow for a direct extraction of a policy\ncapable of sampling from any new reward functions in downstream tasks.\nNonetheless, adapting OC-GFN on a downstream task-specific reward involves an\nintractable marginalization over possible outcomes. We propose a novel way to\napproximate this marginalization by learning an amortized predictor enabling\nefficient fine-tuning. Extensive experimental results validate the efficacy of\nour approach, demonstrating the effectiveness of pre-training the OC-GFN, and\nits ability to swiftly adapt to downstream tasks and discover modes more\nefficiently.

          "description": "Deep learning-based numerical schemes for solving high-dimensional backward\nstochastic differential equations (BSDEs) have recently raised plenty of\nscientific interest. While they enable numerical methods to approximate very\nhigh-dimensional BSDEs, their reliability has not been studied and is thus not\nunderstood. In this work, we study uncertainty quantification (UQ) for a class\nof deep learning-based BSDE schemes. More precisely, we review the sources of\nuncertainty involved in the schemes and numerically study the impact of\ndifferent sources. Usually, the standard deviation (STD) of the approximate\nsolutions obtained from multiple runs of the algorithm with different datasets\nis calculated to address the uncertainty. This approach is computationally\nquite expensive, especially for high-dimensional problems. Hence, we develop a\nUQ model that efficiently estimates the STD of the approximate solution using\nonly a single run of the algorithm. The model also estimates the mean of the\napproximate solution, which can be leveraged to initialize the algorithm and\nimprove the optimization process. Our numerical experiments show that the UQ\nmodel produces reliable estimates of the mean and STD of the approximate\nsolution for the considered class of deep learning-based BSDE schemes. The\nestimated STD captures multiple sources of uncertainty, demonstrating its\neffectiveness in quantifying the uncertainty. Additionally, the model\nillustrates the improved performance when comparing different schemes based on\nthe estimated STD values. Furthermore, it can identify hyperparameter values\nfor which the scheme achieves good approximations.",

          "description": "Probabilistic modelling of power systems operation and planning processes\ndepends on data-driven methods, which require sufficiently large datasets. When\nhistorical data lacks this, it is desired to model the underlying data\ngeneration mechanism as a probability distribution to assess the data quality\nand generate more data, if needed. Kernel density estimation (KDE) based models\nare popular choices for this task, but they fail to adapt to data regions with\nvarying densities. In this paper, an adaptive KDE model is employed to\ncircumvent this, where each kernel in the model has an individual bandwidth.\nThe leave-one-out maximum log-likelihood (LOO-MLL) criterion is proposed to\nprevent the singular solutions that the regular MLL criterion gives rise to,\nand it is proven that LOO-MLL prevents these. Relying on this guaranteed\nrobustness, the model is extended by assigning learnable weights to the\nkernels. In addition, a modified expectation-maximization algorithm is employed\nto accelerate the optimization speed reliably. The performance of the proposed\nmethod and models are exhibited on two power systems datasets using different\nstatistical tests and by comparison with Gaussian mixture models. Results show\nthat the proposed models have promising performance, in addition to their\nsingularity prevention guarantees.",

          "description": "Multi-fidelity (MF) methods are gaining popularity for enhancing surrogate\nmodeling and design optimization by incorporating data from various\nlow-fidelity (LF) models. While most existing MF methods assume a fixed\ndataset, adaptive sampling methods that dynamically allocate resources among\nfidelity models can achieve higher efficiency in the exploring and exploiting\nthe design space. However, most existing MF methods rely on the hierarchical\nassumption of fidelity levels or fail to capture the intercorrelation between\nmultiple fidelity levels and utilize it to quantify the value of the future\nsamples and navigate the adaptive sampling. To address this hurdle, we propose\na framework hinged on a latent embedding for different fidelity models and the\nassociated pre-posterior analysis to explicitly utilize their correlation for\nadaptive sampling. In this framework, each infill sampling iteration includes\ntwo steps: We first identify the location of interest with the greatest\npotential improvement using the high-fidelity (HF) model, then we search for\nthe next sample across all fidelity levels that maximize the improvement per\nunit cost at the location identified in the first step. This is made possible\nby a single Latent Variable Gaussian Process (LVGP) model that maps different\nfidelity models into an interpretable latent space to capture their\ncorrelations without assuming hierarchical fidelity levels. The LVGP enables us\nto assess how LF sampling candidates will affect HF response with pre-posterior\nanalysis and determine the next sample with the best benefit-to-cost ratio.\nThrough test cases, we demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms the\nbenchmark methods in both MF global fitting (GF) and Bayesian Optimization (BO)\nproblems in convergence rate and robustness. Moreover, the method offers the\nflexibility to switch between GF and BO by simply changing the acquisition\nfunction.",

          "description": "Weight decay is a standard technique to improve generalization performance in\nmodern deep neural network optimization, and is also widely adopted in\nfederated learning (FL) to prevent overfitting in local clients. In this paper,\nwe first explore the choices of weight decay and identify that weight decay\nvalue appreciably influences the convergence of existing FL algorithms. While\npreventing overfitting is crucial, weight decay can introduce a different\noptimization goal towards the global objective, which is further amplified in\nFL due to multiple local updates and heterogeneous data distribution. To\naddress this challenge, we develop {\\it Federated optimization with Normalized\nAnnealing Regularization} (FedNAR), a simple yet effective and versatile\nalgorithmic plug-in that can be seamlessly integrated into any existing FL\nalgorithms. Essentially, we regulate the magnitude of each update by performing\nco-clipping of the gradient and weight decay. We provide a comprehensive\ntheoretical analysis of FedNAR's convergence rate and conduct extensive\nexperiments on both vision and language datasets with different backbone\nfederated optimization algorithms. Our experimental results consistently\ndemonstrate that incorporating FedNAR into existing FL algorithms leads to\naccelerated convergence and heightened model accuracy. Moreover, FedNAR\nexhibits resilience in the face of various hyperparameter configurations.\nSpecifically, FedNAR has the ability to self-adjust the weight decay when the\ninitial specification is not optimal, while the accuracy of traditional FL\nalgorithms would markedly decline.

The UTR-LM is\npre-trained on endogenous 5' UTRs from multiple species and is further\naugmented with supervised information including secondary structure and minimum\nfree energy. We fine-tuned the UTR-LM in a variety of downstream tasks. The\nmodel outperformed the best-known benchmark by up to 42% for predicting the\nMean Ribosome Loading, and by up to 60% for predicting the Translation\nEfficiency and the mRNA Expression Level. The model also applies to identifying\nunannotated Internal Ribosome Entry Sites within the untranslated region and\nimproves the AUPR from 0.37 to 0.52 compared to the best baseline. Further, we\ndesigned a library of 211 novel 5' UTRs with high predicted values of\ntranslation efficiency and evaluated them via a wet-lab assay. Experiment\nresults confirmed that our top designs achieved a 32.5% increase in protein\nproduction level relative to well-established 5' UTR optimized for\ntherapeutics.",

High-dimensional problems are\nparticularly challenging as the surrogate model of the objective suffers from\nthe curse of dimensionality, which makes accurate modeling difficult. We\npropose a group testing approach to identify active variables to facilitate\nefficient optimization in these domains. The proposed algorithm, Group Testing\nBayesian Optimization (GTBO), first runs a testing phase where groups of\nvariables are systematically selected and tested on whether they influence the\nobjective. To that end, we extend the well-established theory of group testing\nto functions of continuous ranges. In the second phase, GTBO guides\noptimization by placing more importance on the active dimensions. By exploiting\nthe axis-aligned subspace assumption, GTBO is competitive against\nstate-of-the-art methods on several synthetic and real-world high-dimensional\noptimization tasks. Furthermore, GTBO aids in the discovery of active\nparameters in applications, thereby enhancing practitioners' understanding of\nthe problem at hand.",

          "description": "Privacy and Byzantine resilience (BR) are two crucial requirements of\nmodern-day distributed machine learning. The two concepts have been extensively\nstudied individually but the question of how to combine them effectively\nremains unanswered. This paper contributes to addressing this question by\nstudying the extent to which the distributed SGD algorithm, in the standard\nparameter-server architecture, can learn an accurate model despite (a) a\nfraction of the workers being malicious (Byzantine), and (b) the other\nfraction, whilst being honest, providing noisy information to the server to\nensure differential privacy (DP). We first observe that the integration of\nstandard practices in DP and BR is not straightforward. In fact, we show that\nmany existing results on the convergence of distributed SGD under Byzantine\nfaults, especially those relying on $(\\alpha,f)$-Byzantine resilience, are\nrendered invalid when honest workers enforce DP. To circumvent this\nshortcoming, we revisit the theory of $(\\alpha,f)$-BR to obtain an approximate\nconvergence guarantee. Our analysis provides key insights on how to improve\nthis guarantee through hyperparameter optimization. Essentially, our\ntheoretical and empirical results show that (1) an imprudent combination of\nstandard approaches to DP and BR might be fruitless, but (2) by carefully\nre-tuning the learning algorithm, we can obtain reasonable learning accuracy\nwhile simultaneously guaranteeing DP and BR.",

In this paper, we propose MLAgentBench, a suite of ML tasks for\nbenchmarking AI research agents. Agents can perform actions like\nreading/writing files, executing code, and inspecting outputs. With these\nactions, agents could run experiments, analyze the results, and modify the code\nof entire machine learning pipelines, such as data processing, architecture,\ntraining processes, etc. The benchmark then automatically evaluates the agent's\nperformance objectively over various metrics related to performance and\nefficiency. We also design an LLM-based research agent to automatically perform\nexperimentation loops in such an environment. Empirically, we find that a\nGPT-4-based research agent can feasibly build compelling ML models over many\ntasks in MLAgentBench, displaying highly interpretable plans and actions.\nHowever, the success rates vary considerably; they span from almost 90\\% on\nwell-established older datasets to as low as 10\\% on recent Kaggle Challenges\n-- unavailable during the LLM model's pretraining -- and even 0\\% on newer\nresearch challenges like BabyLM.

In several applications\nthe occurrence of novel classes during deployment poses a significant threat,\nthus it is crucial to effectively detect them. Ideally, this skill should be\nused when needed without requiring any further computational training effort at\nevery new task. Out-of-distribution detection has attracted significant\nattention in the last years, however the majority of the studies deal with 2D\nimages ignoring the inherent 3D nature of the real-world and often confusing\nbetween domain and semantic novelty. In this work, we focus on the latter,\nconsidering the objects geometric structure captured by 3D point clouds\nregardless of the specific domain. We advance the field by introducing\nOpenPatch that builds on a large pre-trained model and simply extracts from its\nintermediate features a set of patch representations that describe each known\nclass. For any new sample, we obtain a novelty score by evaluating whether it\ncan be recomposed mainly by patches of a single known class or rather via the\ncontribution of multiple classes. We present an extensive experimental\nevaluation of our approach for the task of semantic novelty detection on\nreal-world point cloud samples when the reference known data are synthetic. We\ndemonstrate that OpenPatch excels in both the full and few-shot known sample\nscenarios, showcasing its robustness across varying pre-training objectives and\nnetwork backbones.

          "description": "Pretrained large language models (LLMs) are general purpose problem solvers\napplicable to a diverse set of tasks with prompts. They can be further improved\ntowards a specific task by fine-tuning on a specialized dataset. However,\nfine-tuning usually makes the model narrowly specialized on this dataset with\nreduced general in-context learning performances, which is undesirable whenever\nthe fine-tuned model needs to handle additional tasks where no fine-tuning data\nis available. In this work, we first demonstrate that fine-tuning on a single\ntask indeed decreases LLMs' general in-context learning performance. We\ndiscover one important cause of such forgetting, format specialization, where\nthe model overfits to the format of the fine-tuned task. We further show that\nformat specialization happens at the very beginning of fine-tuning. To solve\nthis problem, we propose Prompt Tuning with MOdel Tuning (ProMoT), a simple yet\neffective two-stage fine-tuning framework that reduces format specialization\nand improves generalization. ProMoT offloads task-specific format learning into\nadditional and removable parameters by first doing prompt tuning and then\nfine-tuning the model itself with this soft prompt attached. With experiments\non several fine-tuning tasks and 8 in-context evaluation tasks, we show that\nProMoT achieves comparable performance on fine-tuned tasks to standard\nfine-tuning, but with much less loss of in-context learning performances across\na board range of out-of-domain evaluation tasks. More importantly, ProMoT can\neven enhance generalization on in-context learning tasks that are semantically\nrelated to the fine-tuned task, e.g. ProMoT on En-Fr translation significantly\nimproves performance on other language pairs, and ProMoT on NLI improves\nperformance on summarization. Experiments also show that ProMoT can improve the\ngeneralization performance of multi-task training.",

          "description": "Sparse deep learning has become a popular technique for improving the\nperformance of deep neural networks in areas such as uncertainty\nquantification, variable selection, and large-scale network compression.\nHowever, most existing research has focused on problems where the observations\nare independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.), and there has been little\nwork on the problems where the observations are dependent, such as time series\ndata and sequential data in natural language processing. This paper aims to\naddress this gap by studying the theory for sparse deep learning with dependent\ndata. We show that sparse recurrent neural networks (RNNs) can be consistently\nestimated, and their predictions are asymptotically normally distributed under\nappropriate assumptions, enabling the prediction uncertainty to be correctly\nquantified.

Adversarial\ntraining (AT) has been demonstrated to be the most effective defense strategy\nto protect neural networks from being fooled. However, we find AT omits to\nlearning robust features, resulting in poor performance of adversarial\nrobustness. To address this issue, we highlight two characteristics of robust\nrepresentation: (1) $\\bf{exclusion}$: the feature of natural examples keeps\naway from that of other classes; (2) $\\bf{alignment}$: the feature of natural\nand corresponding adversarial examples is close to each other. These motivate\nus to propose a generic framework of AT to gain robust representation, by the\nasymmetric negative contrast and reverse attention. Specifically, we design an\nasymmetric negative contrast based on predicted probabilities, to push away\nexamples of different classes in the feature space. Moreover, we propose to\nweight feature by parameters of the linear classifier as the reverse attention,\nto obtain class-aware feature and pull close the feature of the same class.\nEmpirical evaluations on three benchmark datasets show our methods greatly\nadvance the robustness of AT and achieve state-of-the-art performance.

Amongst the diverse adjustments in hyperparameters, the adaptation\nof the learning rate emerges as a crucial component, holding the promise of\nsignificantly enhancing the efficacy of FL systems. In response to this\ncritical need, this paper presents FedHyper, a novel hypergradient-based\nlearning rate adaptation algorithm specifically designed for FL. FedHyper\nserves as a universal learning rate scheduler that can adapt both global and\nlocal rates as the training progresses. In addition, FedHyper not only\nshowcases unparalleled robustness to a spectrum of initial learning rate\nconfigurations but also significantly alleviates the necessity for laborious\nempirical learning rate adjustments. We provide a comprehensive theoretical\nanalysis of FedHyper's convergence rate and conduct extensive experiments on\nvision and language benchmark datasets. The results demonstrate that FEDHYPER\nconsistently converges 1.1-3x faster than FedAvg and the competing baselines\nwhile achieving superior final accuracy.

Empirically, we\nshow that pretraining on the leaf labels of ImageNet21k produces better\ntransfer results on ImageNet1k than pretraining on other coarser granularity\nlevels, which supports the common practice used in the community.\nTheoretically, we explain the benefit of fine-grained pretraining by proving\nthat, for a data distribution satisfying certain hierarchy conditions, 1)\ncoarse-grained pretraining only allows a neural network to learn the \"common\"\nor \"easy-to-learn\" features well, while 2) fine-grained pretraining helps the\nnetwork learn the \"rarer\" or \"fine-grained\" features in addition to the common\nones, thus improving its accuracy on hard downstream test samples in which\ncommon features are missing or weak in strength. Furthermore, we perform\ncomprehensive experiments using the label hierarchies of iNaturalist 2021 and\nobserve that the following conditions, in addition to proper choice of label\ngranularity, enable the transfer to work well in practice: 1) the pretraining\ndataset needs to have a meaningful label hierarchy, and 2) the pretraining and\ntarget label functions need to align well.",

In\nparticular, we focus on improving GFlowNet with partial inference: training\nflow functions with the evaluation of the intermediate states or transitions.\nTo this end, the recently developed forward-looking GFlowNet reparameterizes\nthe flow functions based on evaluating the energy of intermediate states.\nHowever, such an evaluation of intermediate energies may (i) be too expensive\nor impossible to evaluate and (ii) even provide misleading training signals\nunder large energy fluctuations along the sequence of actions. To resolve this\nissue, we propose learning energy decompositions for GFlowNets (LED-GFN). Our\nmain idea is to (i) decompose the energy of an object into learnable potential\nfunctions defined on state transitions and (ii) reparameterize the flow\nfunctions using the potential functions. In particular, to produce informative\nlocal credits, we propose to regularize the potential to change smoothly over\nthe sequence of actions. It is also noteworthy that training GFlowNet with our\nlearned potential can preserve the optimal policy.

This\npaper focuses on using model-based trees as surrogate models which partition\nthe feature space into interpretable regions via decision rules. Within each\nregion, interpretable models based on additive main effects are used to\napproximate the behavior of the black box model, striking for an optimal\nbalance between interpretability and performance. Four model-based tree\nalgorithms, namely SLIM, GUIDE, MOB, and CTree, are compared regarding their\nability to generate such surrogate models.

          "description": "Massive MIMO is expected to play an important role in the development of 5G\nnetworks. This paper addresses the issue of pilot contamination and scalability\nin massive MIMO systems. The current practice of reusing orthogonal pilot\nsequences in adjacent cells leads to difficulty in differentiating incoming\ninter- and intra-cell pilot sequences. One possible solution is to increase the\nnumber of orthogonal pilot sequences, which results in dedicating more space of\ncoherence block to pilot transmission than data transmission. This, in turn,\nalso hinders the scalability of massive MIMO systems, particularly in\naccommodating a large number of IoT devices within a cell. To overcome these\nchallenges, this paper devises an innovative pilot allocation scheme based on\nthe data transfer patterns of IoT devices. The scheme assigns orthogonal pilot\nsequences to clusters of devices instead of individual devices, allowing\nmultiple devices to utilize the same pilot for periodically transmitting data.\nMoreover, we formulate the pilot assignment problem as a graph coloring problem\nand use the max k-cut graph partitioning approach to overcome the pilot\ncontamination in a multicell massive MIMO system. The proposed scheme\nsignificantly improves the spectral efficiency and enables the scalability of\nmassive MIMO systems; for instance, by using ten orthogonal pilot sequences, we\nare able to accommodate 200 devices with only a 12.5% omission rate.",

          "description": "History matching based on monitoring data will enable uncertainty reduction,\nand thus improved aquifer management, in industrial-scale carbon storage\noperations. In traditional model-based data assimilation, geomodel parameters\nare modified to force agreement between flow simulation results and\nobservations. In data-space inversion (DSI), history-matched quantities of\ninterest, e.g., posterior pressure and saturation fields conditioned to\nobservations, are inferred directly, without constructing posterior geomodels.\nThis is accomplished efficiently using a set of O(1000) prior simulation\nresults, data parameterization, and posterior sampling within a Bayesian\nsetting. In this study, we develop and implement (in DSI) a deep-learning-based\nparameterization to represent spatio-temporal pressure and CO2 saturation\nfields at a set of time steps. The new parameterization uses an adversarial\nautoencoder (AAE) for dimension reduction and a convolutional long short-term\nmemory (convLSTM) network to represent the spatial distribution and temporal\nevolution of the pressure and saturation fields. This parameterization is used\nwith an ensemble smoother with multiple data assimilation (ESMDA) in the DSI\nframework to enable posterior predictions. A realistic 3D system characterized\nby prior geological realizations drawn from a range of geological scenarios is\nconsidered. A local grid refinement procedure is introduced to estimate the\nerror covariance term that appears in the history matching formulation.\nExtensive history matching results are presented for various quantities, for\nmultiple synthetic true models. Substantial uncertainty reduction in posterior\npressure and saturation fields is achieved in all cases. The framework is\napplied to efficiently provide posterior predictions for a range of error\ncovariance specifications. Such an assessment would be expensive using a\nmodel-based approach.",

Here,\nwe address this shortcoming by proposing an unsupervised LVM which extracts\ntemporally evolving shared and independent latents for distinct, simultaneously\nrecorded experimental modalities. We do this by combining Gaussian Process\nFactor Analysis (GPFA), an interpretable LVM for neural spiking data with\ntemporally smooth latent space, with Gaussian Process Variational Autoencoders\n(GP-VAEs), which similarly use a GP prior to characterize correlations in a\nlatent space, but admit rich expressivity due to a deep neural network mapping\nto observations. We achieve interpretability in our model by partitioning\nlatent variability into components that are either shared between or\nindependent to each modality. We parameterize the latents of our model in the\nFourier domain, and show improved latent identification using this approach\nover standard GP-VAE methods. We validate our model on simulated multi-modal\ndata consisting of Poisson spike counts and MNIST images that scale and rotate\nsmoothly over time. We show that the multi-modal GP-VAE (MM-GPVAE) is able to\nnot only identify the shared and independent latent structure across modalities\naccurately, but provides good reconstructions of both images and neural rates\non held-out trials. Finally, we demonstrate our framework on two real world\nmulti-modal experimental settings: Drosophila whole-brain calcium imaging\nalongside tracked limb positions, and Manduca sexta spike train measurements\nfrom ten wing muscles as the animal tracks a visual stimulus.",

However, they are limited in their ability to\nhandle rotational and viewpoint variations due to information loss in\nmax-pooling layers. Capsule Networks (CapsNets) employ a\ncomputationally-expensive iterative process referred to as dynamic routing to\naddress these issues. CapsNets, however, often fall short on complex datasets\nand require more computational resources than CNNs. To overcome these\nchallenges, we introduce the Parallel Dynamic Routing CapsNet (PDR-CapsNet), a\ndeeper and more energy-efficient alternative to CapsNet that offers superior\nperformance, less energy consumption, and lower overfitting rates. By\nleveraging a parallelization strategy, PDR-CapsNet mitigates the computational\ncomplexity of CapsNet and increases throughput, efficiently using hardware\nresources. As a result, we achieve 83.55\\% accuracy while requiring 87.26\\%\nfewer parameters, 32.27\\% and 47.40\\% fewer MACs, and Flops, achieving 3x\nfaster inference and 7.29J less energy consumption on a 2080Ti GPU with 11GB\nVRAM compared to CapsNet and for the CIFAR-10 dataset.",

          "description": "Molecular property prediction is a critical task in computational drug\ndiscovery. While recent advances in Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and\nTransformers have shown to be effective and promising, they face the following\nlimitations: Transformer self-attention does not explicitly consider the\nunderlying molecule structure while GNN feature representation alone is not\nsufficient to capture granular and hidden interactions and characteristics that\ndistinguish similar molecules. To address these limitations, we propose SYN-\nFUSION, a novel approach that synergistically combines pre-trained features\nfrom GNNs and Transformers. This approach provides a comprehensive molecular\nrepresentation, capturing both the global molecule structure and the individual\natom characteristics. Experimental results on MoleculeNet benchmarks\ndemonstrate superior performance, surpassing previous models in 5 out of 7\nclassification datasets and 4 out of 6 regression datasets. The performance of\nSYN-FUSION has been compared with other Graph-Transformer models that have been\njointly trained using a combination of transformer and graph features, and it\nis found that our approach is on par with those models in terms of performance.\nExtensive analysis of the learned fusion model across aspects such as loss,\nlatent space, and weight distribution further validates the effectiveness of\nSYN-FUSION.

As part of this, the project is organizing the\nICASSP SP Cadenza Challenge: Music Demixing/Remixing for Hearing Aids.

These can then be\nintelligently remixed in a personalized manner to improve audio quality.\nAlternatively, an end-to-end approach could be used.

          "description": "Safe exploration is essential for the practical use of reinforcement learning\n(RL) in many real-world scenarios. In this paper, we present a generalized safe\nexploration (GSE) problem as a unified formulation of common safe exploration\nproblems. We then propose a solution of the GSE problem in the form of a\nmeta-algorithm for safe exploration, MASE, which combines an unconstrained RL\nalgorithm with an uncertainty quantifier to guarantee safety in the current\nepisode while properly penalizing unsafe explorations before actual safety\nviolation to discourage them in future episodes. The advantage of MASE is that\nwe can optimize a policy while guaranteeing with a high probability that no\nsafety constraint will be violated under proper assumptions. Specifically, we\npresent two variants of MASE with different constructions of the uncertainty\nquantifier: one based on generalized linear models with theoretical guarantees\nof safety and near-optimality, and another that combines a Gaussian process to\nensure safety with a deep RL algorithm to maximize the reward. Finally, we\ndemonstrate that our proposed algorithm achieves better performance than\nstate-of-the-art algorithms on grid-world and Safety Gym benchmarks without\nviolating any safety constraints, even during training.",

Most current methods approximate the\nprotein-molecule distribution of a finite dataset and, therefore struggle to\ngenerate molecules with significant binding improvement over the training\ndataset. We instead frame the pocket-conditioned molecular generation task as\nan RL problem and develop TacoGFN, a target conditional Generative Flow Network\nmodel. Our method is explicitly encouraged to generate molecules with desired\nproperties as opposed to fitting on a pre-existing data distribution. To this\nend, we develop transformer-based docking score prediction to speed up docking\nscore computation and propose TacoGFN to explore molecule space efficiently.\nFurthermore, we incorporate several rounds of active learning where generated\nsamples are queried using a docking oracle to improve the docking score\nprediction. This approach allows us to accurately explore as much of the\nmolecule landscape as we can afford computationally.

          "description": "Over the past decade, machine learning has demonstrated impressive results,\noften surpassing human capabilities in sensing tasks relevant to autonomous\nflight. Unlike traditional aerospace software, the parameters of machine\nlearning models are not hand-coded nor derived from physics but learned from\ndata.

As a result, requirements\ncannot be directly traced to lines of code, hindering the current bottom-up\naerospace certification paradigm. This paper attempts to address this gap by 1)\ndemystifying the inner workings and processes to build machine learning models,\n2) formally establishing theoretical guarantees given by those processes, and\n3) complementing these formal elements with practical considerations to develop\na complete certification argument for safety-critical machine learning systems.\nBased on a scalable statistical verifier, our proposed framework is\nmodel-agnostic and tool-independent, making it adaptable to many use cases in\nthe industry.

          "description": "Property prediction on molecular graphs is an important application of Graph\nNeural Networks (GNNs). Recently, unlabeled molecular data has become abundant,\nwhich facilitates the rapid development of self-supervised learning for GNNs in\nthe chemical domain. In this work, we propose pretraining GNNs at the fragment\nlevel, which serves as a promising middle ground to overcome the limitations of\nnode-level and graph-level pretraining. Borrowing techniques from recent work\non principle subgraph mining, we obtain a compact vocabulary of prevalent\nfragments that span a large pretraining dataset. From the extracted vocabulary,\nwe introduce several fragment-based contrastive and predictive pretraining\ntasks. The contrastive learning task jointly pretrains two different GNNs: one\nbased on molecular graphs and one based on fragment graphs, which represents\nhigh-order connectivity within molecules. By enforcing the consistency between\nthe fragment embedding and the aggregated embedding of the corresponding atoms\nfrom the molecular graphs, we ensure that both embeddings capture structural\ninformation at multiple resolutions. The structural information of the fragment\ngraphs is further exploited to extract auxiliary labels for the graph-level\npredictive pretraining. We employ both the pretrained molecular-based and\nfragment-based GNNs for downstream prediction, thus utilizing the fragment\ninformation during finetuning. Our models advance the performances on 5 out of\n8 common molecular benchmarks and improve the performances on long-range\nbiological benchmarks by at least 11.5%.",

          "description": "Interactive search can provide a better experience by incorporating\ninteraction feedback from the users. This can significantly improve search\naccuracy as it helps avoid irrelevant information and captures the users'\nsearch intents. Existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) systems use reinforcement\nlearning (RL) models to incorporate the interactions but focus on item-level\nfeedback, ignoring the fine-grained information found in sentence-level\nfeedback. Yet such feedback requires extensive RL action space exploration and\nlarge amounts of annotated data. This work addresses these challenges by\nproposing a new deep Q-learning (DQ) approach, DQrank. DQrank adapts BERT-based\nmodels, the SOTA in natural language processing, to select crucial sentences\nbased on users' engagement and rank the items to obtain more satisfactory\nresponses. We also propose two mechanisms to better explore optimal actions.\nDQrank further utilizes the experience replay mechanism in DQ to store the\nfeedback sentences to obtain a better initial ranking performance. We validate\nthe effectiveness of DQrank on three search datasets. The results show that\nDQRank performs at least 12% better than the previous SOTA RL approaches. We\nalso conduct detailed ablation studies. The ablation results demonstrate that\neach model component can efficiently extract and accumulate long-term\nengagement effects from the users' sentence-level feedback.

Know2BIO integrates data from 30 diverse\nsources, capturing intricate relationships across 11 biomedical categories. It\ncurrently consists of ~219,000 nodes and ~6,200,000 edges. Know2BIO is capable\nof user-directed automated updating to reflect the latest knowledge in\nbiomedical science. Furthermore, Know2BIO is accompanied by multi-modal data:\nnode features including text descriptions, protein and compound sequences and\nstructures, enabling the utilization of emerging natural language processing\nmethods and multi-modal data integration strategies. We evaluate KG\nrepresentation models on Know2BIO, demonstrating its effectiveness as a\nbenchmark for KG representation learning in the biomedical field.

          "description": "The popularity of pre-trained large models has revolutionized downstream\ntasks across diverse fields, such as language, vision, and multi-modality. To\nminimize the adaption cost for downstream tasks, many Parameter-Efficient\nFine-Tuning (PEFT) techniques are proposed for language and 2D image\npre-trained models. However, the specialized PEFT method for 3D pre-trained\nmodels is still under-explored. To this end, we introduce Point-PEFT, a novel\nframework for adapting point cloud pre-trained models with minimal learnable\nparameters. Specifically, for a pre-trained 3D model, we freeze most of its\nparameters, and only tune the newly added PEFT modules on downstream tasks,\nwhich consist of a Point-prior Prompt and a Geometry-aware Adapter. The\nPoint-prior Prompt adopts a set of learnable prompt tokens, for which we\npropose to construct a memory bank with domain-specific knowledge, and utilize\na parameter-free attention to enhance the prompt tokens. The Geometry-aware\nAdapter aims to aggregate point cloud features within spatial neighborhoods to\ncapture fine-grained geometric information through local interactions.\nExtensive experiments indicate that our Point-PEFT can achieve better\nperformance than the full fine-tuning on various downstream tasks, while using\nonly 5% of the trainable parameters, demonstrating the efficiency and\neffectiveness of our approach.

IoT\nForensics is collecting and analyzing digital evidence from IoT devices to\ninvestigate cybercrimes, security breaches, and other malicious activities that\nmay have taken place on these connected devices. In particular, EM-SCA has\nbecome an essential tool for IoT forensics due to its ability to reveal\nconfidential information about the internal workings of IoT devices without\ninterfering these devices or wiretapping their networks. However, the accuracy\nand reliability of EM-SCA results can be limited by device variability,\nenvironmental factors, and data collection and processing methods. Besides,\nthere is very few research on these limitations that affects significantly the\naccuracy of EM-SCA approaches for the crossed-IoT device portability as well as\nlimited research on the possible solutions to address such challenge.\nTherefore, this empirical study examines the impact of device variability on\nthe accuracy and reliability of EM-SCA approaches, in particular\nmachine-learning (ML) based approaches for EM-SCA. We firstly presents the\nbackground, basic concepts and techniques used to evaluate the limitations of\ncurrent EM-SCA approaches and datasets. Our study then addresses one of the\nmost important limitation, which is caused by the multi-core architecture of\nthe processors (SoC). We present an approach to collect the EM-SCA datasets and\ndemonstrate the feasibility of using transfer learning to obtain more\nmeaningful and reliable results from EM-SCA in IoT forensics of crossed-IoT\ndevices.

          "description": "Brain tumors pose significant health challenges worldwide, with glioblastoma\nbeing one of the most aggressive forms. Accurate determination of the\nO6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) promoter methylation status is\ncrucial for personalized treatment strategies.

This paper proposes a novel multi-modal\napproach, BTDNet, leveraging multi-parametric MRI scans, including FLAIR, T1w,\nT1wCE, and T2 3D volumes, to predict MGMT promoter methylation status. BTDNet\naddresses two main challenges: the variable volume lengths (i.e., each volume\nconsists of a different number of slices) and the volume-level annotations\n(i.e., the whole 3D volume is annotated and not the independent slices that it\nconsists of).

          "description": "Otago Exercise Program (OEP) is a rehabilitation program for older adults to\nimprove frailty, sarcopenia, and balance. Accurate monitoring of patient\ninvolvement in OEP is challenging, as self-reports (diaries) are often\nunreliable. With the development of wearable sensors, Human Activity\nRecognition (HAR) systems using wearable sensors have revolutionized\nhealthcare. However, their usage for OEP still shows limited performance. The\nobjective of this study is to build an unobtrusive and accurate system to\nmonitor OEP for older adults. Data was collected from older adults wearing a\nsingle waist-mounted Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU). Two datasets were\ncollected, one in a laboratory setting, and one at the homes of the patients. A\nhierarchical system is proposed with two stages: 1) using a deep learning model\nto recognize whether the patients are performing OEP or activities of daily\nlife (ADLs) using a 10-minute sliding window; 2) based on stage 1, using a\n6-second sliding window to recognize the OEP sub-classes performed. The results\nshowed that in stage 1, OEP could be recognized with window-wise f1-scores over\n0.95 and Intersection-over-Union (IoU) f1-scores over 0.85 for both datasets.\nIn stage 2, for the home scenario, four activities could be recognized with\nf1-scores over 0.8: ankle plantarflexors, abdominal muscles, knee bends, and\nsit-to-stand. The results showed the potential of monitoring the compliance of\nOEP using a single IMU in daily life. Also, some OEP sub-classes are possible\nto be recognized for further analysis.",

          "description": "Large language models (LLMs) have initiated a paradigm shift in transfer\nlearning. In contrast to the classic pretraining-then-finetuning procedure, in\norder to use LLMs for downstream prediction tasks, one only needs to provide a\nfew demonstrations, known as in-context examples, without adding more or\nupdating existing model parameters. This in-context learning (ICL) capability\nof LLMs is intriguing, and it is not yet fully understood how pretrained LLMs\nacquire such capabilities. In this paper, we investigate the reason why a\ntransformer-based language model can accomplish in-context learning after\npre-training on a general language corpus by proposing one hypothesis that LLMs\ncan simulate kernel regression with internal representations when faced with\nin-context examples. More concretely, we first prove that Bayesian inference on\nin-context prompts can be asymptotically understood as kernel regression $\\hat\ny = \\sum_i y_i K(x, x_i)/\\sum_i K(x, x_i)$ as the number of in-context\ndemonstrations grows. Then, we empirically investigate the in-context behaviors\nof language models. We find that during ICL, the attention and hidden features\nin LLMs match the behaviors of a kernel regression. Finally, our theory\nprovides insights into multiple phenomena observed in the ICL field: why\nretrieving demonstrative samples similar to test samples can help, why ICL\nperformance is sensitive to the output formats, and why ICL accuracy benefits\nfrom selecting in-distribution and representative samples.",

          "description": "Variational dimensionality reduction methods are known for their high\naccuracy, generative abilities, and robustness. These methods have many\ntheoretical justifications. Here we introduce a unifying principle rooted in\ninformation theory to rederive and generalize existing variational methods and\ndesign new ones. We base our framework on an interpretation of the multivariate\ninformation bottleneck, in which two Bayesian networks are traded off against\none another. We interpret the first network as an encoder graph, which\nspecifies what information to keep when compressing the data. We interpret the\nsecond network as a decoder graph, which specifies a generative model for the\ndata. Using this framework, we rederive existing dimensionality reduction\nmethods such as the deep variational information bottleneck (DVIB), beta\nvariational auto-encoders (beta-VAE), and deep variational canonical\ncorrelation analysis (DVCCA). The framework naturally introduces a trade-off\nparameter between compression and reconstruction in the DVCCA family of\nalgorithms, resulting in the new beta-DVCCA family. In addition, we derive a\nnew variational dimensionality reduction method, deep variational symmetric\ninformational bottleneck (DVSIB), which simultaneously compresses two variables\nto preserve information between their compressed representations. We implement\nall of these algorithms and evaluate their ability to produce shared low\ndimensional latent spaces on a modified noisy MNIST dataset. We show that\nalgorithms that are better matched to the structure of the data (beta-DVCCA and\nDVSIB) produce better latent spaces as measured by classification accuracy and\nthe dimensionality of the latent variables. We believe that this framework can\nbe used to unify other multi-view representation learning algorithms.\nAdditionally, it provides a straightforward framework for deriving\nproblem-specific loss functions.",

Neural Turing\nmachines (NTMs) are novel RNNs that implement the notion of programmable\ncomputers with neural network controllers that can learn simple algorithmic\ntasks. Matrix neural networks feature matrix representation which inherently\npreserves the spatial structure of data when compared to canonical neural\nnetworks that use vector-based representation. One may then argue that neural\nnetworks with matrix representations may have the potential to provide better\nmemory capacity. In this paper, we define and study a probabilistic notion of\nmemory capacity based on Fisher information for matrix-based RNNs. We find\nbounds on memory capacity for such networks under various hypotheses and\ncompare them with their vector counterparts. In particular, we show that the\nmemory capacity of such networks is bounded by $N^2$ for $N\\times N$ state\nmatrix which generalizes the one known for vector networks. We also show and\nanalyze the increase in memory capacity for such networks which is introduced\nwhen one exhibits an external state memory, such as NTMs. Consequently, we\nconstruct NTMs with RNN controllers with matrix-based representation of\nexternal memory, leading us to introduce Matrix NTMs. We demonstrate the\nperformance of this class of memory networks under certain algorithmic learning\ntasks such as copying and recall and compare it with Matrix RNNs.

Previous model-parallel systems such as Megatron-LM\npartition and compute different attention heads in parallel, resulting in large\ncommunication volumes, so they cannot scale beyond the number of attention\nheads, thereby hindering its adoption. In this paper, we introduce a new\napproach, LightSeq, for long-context LLMs training. LightSeq has many notable\nadvantages. First, LightSeq partitions over the sequence dimension, hence is\nagnostic to model architectures and readily applicable for models with varying\nnumbers of attention heads, such as Multi-Head, Multi-Query and Grouped-Query\nattention. Second, LightSeq not only requires up to 4.7x less communication\nthan Megatron-LM on popular LLMs but also overlaps the communication with\ncomputation. To further reduce the training time, LightSeq features a novel\ngradient checkpointing scheme to bypass an forward computation for\nmemory-efficient attention. We evaluate LightSeq on Llama-7B and its variants\nwith sequence lengths from 32K to 512K. Through comprehensive experiments on\nsingle and cross-node training, we show that LightSeq achieves up to 1.24-2.01x\nend-to-end speedup, and a 2-8x longer sequence length on models with fewer\nheads, compared to Megatron-LM.

Moreover, by changing the temperature hyperparameter, our\napproach can reveal the atoms that are important for activity prediction in a\nsmooth and consistent way, thus providing a novel, regulated attention\nmechanism for graph neural networks. We further validate our method by showing\nthat it recapitulates the functional group in beta-Lactam antibiotics.

          "description": "This paper investigates new families of compositional optimization problems,\ncalled $\\underline{\\bf n}$on-$\\underline{\\bf s}$mooth $\\underline{\\bf\nw}$eakly-$\\underline{\\bf c}$onvex $\\underline{\\bf f}$inite-sum $\\underline{\\bf\nc}$oupled $\\underline{\\bf c}$ompositional $\\underline{\\bf o}$ptimization (NSWC\nFCCO). There has been a growing interest in FCCO due to its wide-ranging\napplications in machine learning and AI, as well as its ability to address the\nshortcomings of stochastic algorithms based on empirical risk minimization.\nHowever, current research on FCCO presumes that both the inner and outer\nfunctions are smooth, limiting their potential to tackle a more diverse set of\nproblems. Our research expands on this area by examining non-smooth\nweakly-convex FCCO, where the outer function is weakly convex and\nnon-decreasing, and the inner function is weakly-convex. We analyze a\nsingle-loop algorithm and establish its complexity for finding an\n$\\epsilon$-stationary point of the Moreau envelop of the objective function.\nAdditionally, we also extend the algorithm to solving novel non-smooth\nweakly-convex tri-level finite-sum coupled compositional optimization problems,\nwhich feature a nested arrangement of three functions. Lastly, we explore the\napplications of our algorithms in deep learning for two-way partial AUC\nmaximization and multi-instance two-way partial AUC maximization, using\nempirical studies to showcase the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms.",

          "description": "Embedding plays a critical role in modern recommender systems because they\nare virtual representations of real-world entities and the foundation for\nsubsequent decision models. In this paper, we propose a novel embedding update\nmechanism, Structure-aware Embedding Evolution (SEvo for short), to encourage\nrelated nodes to evolve similarly at each step. Unlike GNN (Graph Neural\nNetwork) that typically serves as an intermediate part, SEvo is able to\ndirectly inject the graph structure information into embedding with negligible\ncomputational overhead in training. The convergence properties of SEvo as well\nas its possible variants are theoretically analyzed to justify the validity of\nthe designs. Moreover, SEvo can be seamlessly integrated into existing\noptimizers for state-of-the-art performance. In particular, SEvo-enhanced AdamW\nwith moment estimate correction demonstrates consistent improvements across a\nspectrum of models and datasets, suggesting a novel technical route to\neffectively utilize graph structure information beyond explicit GNN modules.",

          "description": "With the blowout development of pre-trained models (PTMs), the efficient\ntuning of these models for diverse downstream applications has emerged as a\npivotal research concern. Although recent investigations into prompt tuning\nhave provided promising avenues, three salient challenges persist: (1) memory\nconstraint: the continuous growth in the size of open-source PTMs renders\nfine-tuning, even a fraction of their parameters, challenging for many\npractitioners. (2) model privacy: existing PTMs often function as public API\nservices, with their parameters inaccessible for effective or tailored\nfine-tuning. (3) data privacy: the fine-tuning of PTMs necessitates\nhigh-quality datasets, which are typically localized and not shared to public.\nTo optimally harness each local dataset while navigating memory constraints and\npreserving privacy, we propose Federated Black-Box Prompt Tuning (Fed-BBPT).\nThis innovative approach eschews reliance on parameter architectures and\nprivate dataset access, instead capitalizing on a central server that aids\nlocal users in collaboratively training a prompt generator through regular\naggregation. Local users leverage API-driven learning via a zero-order\noptimizer, obviating the need for PTM deployment. Relative to extensive\nfine-tuning, Fed-BBPT proficiently sidesteps memory challenges tied to PTM\nstorage and fine-tuning on local machines, tapping into comprehensive,\nhigh-quality, yet private training datasets. A thorough evaluation across 40\ndatasets spanning CV and NLP tasks underscores the robustness of our proposed\nmodel.",

However,\ntraining or fine-tuning LLMs requires a vast amount of data, which can be\nchallenging to access due to legal or technical restrictions and may require\nprivate computing resources. Federated Learning (FL) is a solution designed to\novercome these challenges and expand data access for deep learning\napplications.\n\nThis paper takes a hardware-centric approach to explore how LLMs can be\nbrought to modern edge computing systems. Our study fine-tunes the FLAN-T5\nmodel family, ranging from 80M to 3B parameters, using FL for a text\nsummarization task. We provide a micro-level hardware benchmark, compare the\nmodel FLOP utilization to a state-of-the-art data center GPU, and study the\nnetwork utilization in realistic conditions. Our contribution is twofold:\nFirst, we evaluate the current capabilities of edge computing systems and their\npotential for LLM FL workloads.

          "description": "Tabular data prediction is a fundamental machine learning task for many\napplications. Existing methods predominantly employ discriminative modeling and\noperate under the assumption of a fixed target column, necessitating\nre-training for every new predictive task. Inspired by the generative power of\nlarge language models (LLMs), this paper exploits the idea of building\nuniversal tabular data predictors based on generative modeling, namely\nUniPredict. Here, we show that scaling up an LLM to extensive tabular datasets\nwith the capability of comprehending diverse tabular inputs and predicting for\ntarget variables following the input instructions. Specifically, we train a\nsingle LLM on an aggregation of 169 tabular datasets with diverse targets and\ncompare its performance against baselines that are trained on each dataset\nseparately. We observe this versatile UniPredict model demonstrates an\nadvantage over other models, ranging from 5.4% to 13.4%, when compared with the\nbest tree-boosting baseline and the best neural network baseline, respectively.\nWe further test UniPredict in few-shot learning settings on another 62 tabular\ndatasets. Our method achieves strong performance in quickly adapting to new\ntasks, where our method outperforms XGBoost over 100% on the low-resource setup\nand shows a significant margin over all baselines. We envision that UniPredict\nsheds light on developing a universal tabular data prediction system that\nlearns from data at scale and serves a wide range of prediction tasks.",

This optimization leads\nto reduced operational costs, improved customer demand fulfillment, and\nenhanced production efficiency. However, machine scheduling remains a\nchallenging combinatorial problem due to its NP-hard nature. Deep Reinforcement\nLearning (DRL), a key component of artificial general intelligence, has shown\npromise in various domains like gaming and robotics. Researchers have explored\napplying DRL to machine scheduling problems since 1995. This paper offers a\ncomprehensive review and comparison of DRL-based approaches, highlighting their\nmethodology, applications, advantages, and limitations. It categorizes these\napproaches based on computational components: conventional neural networks,\nencoder-decoder architectures, graph neural networks, and metaheuristic\nalgorithms. Our review concludes that DRL-based methods outperform exact\nsolvers, heuristics, and tabular reinforcement learning algorithms in terms of\ncomputation speed and generating near-global optimal solutions. These DRL-based\napproaches have been successfully applied to static and dynamic scheduling\nacross diverse machine environments and job characteristics. However, DRL-based\nschedulers face limitations in handling complex operational constraints,\nconfigurable multi-objective optimization, generalization, scalability,\ninterpretability, and robustness.

          "description": "Latent space Energy-Based Models (EBMs), also known as energy-based priors,\nhave drawn growing interests in the field of generative modeling due to its\nflexibility in the formulation and strong modeling power of the latent space.\nHowever, the common practice of learning latent space EBMs with non-convergent\nshort-run MCMC for prior and posterior sampling is hindering the model from\nfurther progress; the degenerate MCMC sampling quality in practice often leads\nto degraded generation quality and instability in training, especially with\nhighly multi-modal and/or high-dimensional target distributions. To remedy this\nsampling issue, in this paper we introduce a simple but effective\ndiffusion-based amortization method for long-run MCMC sampling and develop a\nnovel learning algorithm for the latent space EBM based on it. We provide\ntheoretical evidence that the learned amortization of MCMC is a valid long-run\nMCMC sampler. Experiments on several image modeling benchmark datasets\ndemonstrate the superior performance of our method compared with strong\ncounterparts",

          "description": "By now there is substantial evidence that deep learning models learn certain\nhuman-interpretable features as part of their internal representations of data.\nAs having the right (or wrong) concepts is critical to trustworthy machine\nlearning systems, it is natural to ask which inputs from the model's original\ntraining set were most important for learning a concept at a given layer. To\nanswer this, we combine data attribution methods with methods for probing the\nconcepts learned by a model. Training network and probe ensembles for two\nconcept datasets on a range of network layers, we use the recently developed\nTRAK method for large-scale data attribution. We find some evidence for\nconvergence, where removing the 10,000 top attributing images for a concept and\nretraining the model does not change the location of the concept in the network\nnor the probing sparsity of the concept. This suggests that rather than being\nhighly dependent on a few specific examples, the features that inform the\ndevelopment of a concept are spread in a more diffuse manner across its\nexemplars, implying robustness in concept formation.",

          "description": "Traditional deep learning (DL) suffers from two core problems. Firstly, it\nassumes training samples are independent and identically distributed. However,\nnumerous real-world datasets group samples by shared measurements (e.g., study\nparticipants or cells), violating this assumption. In these scenarios, DL can\nshow compromised performance, limited generalization, and interpretability\nissues, coupled with cluster confounding causing Type 1 and 2 errors. Secondly,\nmodels are typically trained for overall accuracy, often neglecting\nunderrepresented groups and introducing biases in crucial areas like loan\napprovals or determining health insurance rates, such biases can significantly\nimpact one's quality of life. To address both of these challenges\nsimultaneously, we present a mixed effects deep learning (MEDL) framework. MEDL\nseparately quantifies cluster-invariant fixed effects (FE) and cluster-specific\nrandom effects (RE) through the introduction of: 1) a cluster adversary which\nencourages the learning of cluster-invariant FE, 2) a Bayesian neural network\nwhich quantifies the RE, and a mixing function combining the FE an RE into a\nmixed-effect prediction. We marry this MEDL with adversarial debiasing, which\npromotes equality-of-odds fairness across FE, RE, and ME predictions for\nfairness-sensitive variables. We evaluated our approach using three datasets:\ntwo from census/finance focusing on income classification and one from\nhealthcare predicting hospitalization duration, a regression task. Our\nframework notably enhances fairness across all sensitive variables-increasing\nfairness up to 82% for age, 43% for race, 86% for sex, and 27% for\nmarital-status. Besides promoting fairness, our method maintains the robust\nperformance and clarity of MEDL. It's versatile, suitable for various dataset\ntypes and tasks, making it broadly applicable.

          "description": "Medical image classification is a critical problem for healthcare, with the\npotential to alleviate the workload of doctors and facilitate diagnoses of\npatients. However, two challenges arise when deploying deep learning models to\nreal-world healthcare applications. First, neural models tend to learn spurious\ncorrelations instead of desired features, which could fall short when\ngeneralizing to new domains (e.g., patients with different ages). Second, these\nblack-box models lack interpretability. When making diagnostic predictions, it\nis important to understand why a model makes a decision for trustworthy and\nsafety considerations. In this paper, to address these two limitations, we\npropose a new paradigm to build robust and interpretable medical image\nclassifiers with natural language concepts. Specifically, we first query\nclinical concepts from GPT-4, then transform latent image features into\nexplicit concepts with a vision-language model. We systematically evaluate our\nmethod on eight medical image classification datasets to verify its\neffectiveness. On challenging datasets with strong confounding factors, our\nmethod can mitigate spurious correlations thus substantially outperform\nstandard visual encoders and other baselines. Finally, we show how\nclassification with a small number of concepts brings a level of\ninterpretability for understanding model decisions through case studies in real\nmedical data.",

          "description": "Twitter is currently one of the biggest social media platforms. Its users may\nshare, read, and engage with short posts called tweets. For the ACM Recommender\nSystems Conference 2020, Twitter published a dataset around 70 GB in size for\nthe annual RecSys Challenge. In 2020, the RecSys Challenge invited\nparticipating teams to create models that would predict engagement likelihoods\nfor given user-tweet combinations. The submitted models predicting like, reply,\nretweet, and quote engagements were evaluated based on two metrics: area under\nthe precision-recall curve (PRAUC) and relative cross-entropy (RCE).\n\nIn this diploma thesis, we used the RecSys 2020 Challenge dataset and\nevaluation procedure to investigate how well context alone may be used to\npredict tweet engagement likelihood. In doing so, we employed the Spark engine\non TU Wien's Little Big Data Cluster to create scalable data preprocessing,\nfeature engineering, feature selection, and machine learning pipelines. We\nmanually created just under 200 additional features to describe tweet context.\n\nThe results indicate that features describing users' prior engagement history\nand the popularity of hashtags and links in the tweet were the most\ninformative. We also found that factors such as the prediction algorithm,\ntraining dataset size, training dataset sampling method, and feature selection\nsignificantly affect the results. After comparing the best results of our\ncontext-only prediction models with content-only models and with models\ndeveloped by the Challenge winners, we identified that the context-based models\nunderperformed in terms of the RCE score. This work thus concludes by situating\nthis discrepancy and proposing potential improvements to our implementation,\nwhich is shared in a public git repository.",

Prior work has studied different ways of automatically creating\ndescriptor sets for every class based on prompt templates, ranging from\nmanually engineered templates over templates obtained from a large language\nmodel to templates built from random words and characters. In contrast,\nderiving zero-shot classifiers from the respective encoded class descriptors\nhas remained nearly unchanged, that is: classify to the class that maximizes\nthe cosine similarity between its averaged encoded class descriptors and the\nencoded image.

          "description": "Consistency regularization-based methods are prevalent in semi-supervised\nlearning (SSL) algorithms due to their exceptional performance. However, they\nmainly depend on domain-specific data augmentations, which are not usable in\ndomains where data augmentations are less practicable. On the other hand,\nPseudo-labeling (PL) is a general and domain-agnostic SSL approach that, unlike\nconsistency regularization-based methods, does not rely on the domain. PL\nunderperforms due to the erroneous high-confidence predictions from poorly\ncalibrated models. This paper proposes an uncertainty-aware pseudo-label\nselection framework that employs uncertainty sets yielded by the conformal\nregularization algorithm to fix the poor calibration neural networks, reducing\nnoisy training data.

          "description": "Compositional generalization is a key ability of humans that enables us to\nlearn new concepts from only a handful examples. Machine learning models,\nincluding the now ubiquitous transformers, struggle to generalize in this way,\nand typically require thousands of examples of a concept during training in\norder to generalize meaningfully. This difference in ability between humans and\nartificial neural architectures, motivates this study on a neuro-symbolic\narchitecture called the Compositional Program Generator (CPG). CPG has three\nkey features: modularity, type abstraction, and recursive composition, that\nenable it to generalize both systematically to new concepts in a few-shot\nmanner, as well as productively by length on various sequence-to-sequence\nlanguage tasks. For each input, CPG uses a grammar of the input domain and a\nparser to generate a type hierarchy in which each grammar rule is assigned its\nown unique semantic module, a probabilistic copy or substitution program.\nInstances with the same hierarchy are processed with the same composed program,\nwhile those with different hierarchies may be processed with different\nprograms. CPG learns parameters for the semantic modules and is able to learn\nthe semantics for new types incrementally. Given a context-free grammar of the\ninput language and a dictionary mapping each word in the source language to its\ninterpretation in the output language, CPG can achieve perfect generalization\non the SCAN and COGS benchmarks, in both standard and extreme few-shot\nsettings.",

          "description": "Semi-supervised learning (SSL) is a promising approach for training deep\nclassification models using labeled and unlabeled datasets. However, existing\nSSL methods rely on a large unlabeled dataset, which may not always be\navailable in many real-world applications due to legal constraints (e.g.,\nGDPR). In this paper, we investigate the research question: Can we train SSL\nmodels without real unlabeled datasets? Instead of using real unlabeled\ndatasets, we propose an SSL method using synthetic datasets generated from\ngenerative foundation models trained on datasets containing millions of samples\nin diverse domains (e.g., ImageNet). Our main concepts are identifying\nsynthetic samples that emulate unlabeled samples from generative foundation\nmodels and training classifiers using these synthetic samples. To achieve this,\nour method is formulated as an alternating optimization problem: (i)\nmeta-learning of generative foundation models and (ii) SSL of classifiers using\nreal labeled and synthetic unlabeled samples. For (i), we propose a\nmeta-learning objective that optimizes latent variables to generate samples\nthat resemble real labeled samples and minimize the validation loss. For (ii),\nwe propose a simple unsupervised loss function that regularizes the feature\nextractors of classifiers to maximize the performance improvement obtained from\nsynthetic samples. We confirm that our method outperforms baselines using\ngenerative foundation models on SSL. We also demonstrate that our methods\noutperform SSL using real unlabeled datasets in scenarios with extremely small\namounts of labeled datasets. This suggests that synthetic samples have the\npotential to provide improvement gains more efficiently than real unlabeled\ndata.",

While\neffective, these methods require high volume of annotated data, which can be\ndifficult to obtain. Here, we investigate the capabilities of visual in-context\nlearning that can perform few-shot eczema segmentation with just a handful of\nexamples and without any need for retraining models. Specifically, we propose a\nstrategy for applying in-context learning for eczema segmentation with a\ngeneralist vision model called SegGPT.

We also discover that using more number of\nexamples for SegGPT may in fact be harmful to its performance.

In this paper, we propose Harmonic-NAS, a framework for the joint\noptimization of unimodal backbones and multimodal fusion networks with hardware\nawareness on resource-constrained devices. Harmonic-NAS involves a two-tier\noptimization approach for the unimodal backbone architectures and fusion\nstrategy and operators. By incorporating the hardware dimension into the\noptimization, evaluation results on various devices and multimodal datasets\nhave demonstrated the superiority of Harmonic-NAS over state-of-the-art\napproaches achieving up to 10.9% accuracy improvement, 1.91x latency reduction,\nand 2.14x energy efficiency gain.",

The existing regularization techniques mainly rely on\nthe i.i.d. assumption and only consider the knowledge from the current sample,\nwithout the leverage of the neighboring relationship between samples.

Our proposal explicitly constructs patch-level graphs\nin different layers and then linearly interpolates neighborhood patch features,\nserving as a general and effective regularization strategy.

          "description": "Federated learning has gained popularity as a means of training models\ndistributed across the wireless edge. The paper introduces delay-aware\nhierarchical federated learning (DFL) to improve the efficiency of distributed\nmachine learning (ML) model training by accounting for communication delays\nbetween edge and cloud. Different from traditional federated learning, DFL\nleverages multiple stochastic gradient descent iterations on local datasets\nwithin each global aggregation period and intermittently aggregates model\nparameters through edge servers in local subnetworks. During global\nsynchronization, the cloud server consolidates local models with the outdated\nglobal model using a local-global combiner, thus preserving crucial elements of\nboth, enhancing learning efficiency under the presence of delay. A set of\nconditions is obtained to achieve the sub-linear convergence rate of O(1/k) for\nstrongly convex and smooth loss functions. Based on these findings, an adaptive\ncontrol algorithm is developed for DFL, implementing policies to mitigate\nenergy consumption and communication latency while aiming for sublinear\nconvergence. Numerical evaluations show DFL's superior performance in terms of\nfaster global model convergence, reduced resource consumption, and robustness\nagainst communication delays compared to existing FL algorithms. In summary,\nthis proposed method offers improved efficiency and results when dealing with\nboth convex and non-convex loss functions.",

However, it is unclear if these two notions can be\nsimultaneously achieved or if there exist trade-offs between them. In this\nwork, we make one of the first attempts at studying the impact of adversarially\nrobust models on actionable explanations which provide end users with a means\nfor recourse. We theoretically and empirically analyze the cost (ease of\nimplementation) and validity (probability of obtaining a positive model\nprediction) of recourses output by state-of-the-art algorithms when the\nunderlying models are adversarially robust vs. non-robust. More specifically,\nwe derive theoretical bounds on the differences between the cost and the\nvalidity of the recourses generated by state-of-the-art algorithms for\nadversarially robust vs. non-robust linear and non-linear models. Our empirical\nresults with multiple real-world datasets validate our theoretical results and\nshow the impact of varying degrees of model robustness on the cost and validity\nof the resulting recourses.

          "description": "While reliable data-driven decision-making hinges on high-quality labeled\ndata, the acquisition of quality labels often involves laborious human\nannotations or slow and expensive scientific measurements. Machine learning is\nbecoming an appealing alternative as sophisticated predictive techniques are\nbeing used to quickly and cheaply produce large amounts of predicted labels;\ne.g., predicted protein structures are used to supplement experimentally\nderived structures, predictions of socioeconomic indicators from satellite\nimagery are used to supplement accurate survey data, and so on. Since\npredictions are imperfect and potentially biased, this practice brings into\nquestion the validity of downstream inferences. We introduce cross-prediction:\na method for valid inference powered by machine learning. With a small labeled\ndataset and a large unlabeled dataset, cross-prediction imputes the missing\nlabels via machine learning and applies a form of debiasing to remedy the\nprediction inaccuracies. The resulting inferences achieve the desired error\nprobability and are more powerful than those that only leverage the labeled\ndata. Closely related is the recent proposal of prediction-powered inference,\nwhich assumes that a good pre-trained model is already available. We show that\ncross-prediction is consistently more powerful than an adaptation of\nprediction-powered inference in which a fraction of the labeled data is split\noff and used to train the model. Finally, we observe that cross-prediction\ngives more stable conclusions than its competitors; its confidence intervals\ntypically have significantly lower variability.",

          "description": "Contrastive deep graph clustering (CDGC) utilizes contrastive learning to\ngroup nodes into different clusters. Better augmentation techniques benefit the\nquality of the contrastive samples, thus being one of key factors to improve\nperformance. However, the augmentation samples in existing methods are always\npredefined by human experiences, and agnostic from the downstream task\nclustering, thus leading to high human resource costs and poor performance. To\nthis end, we propose an Attribute Graph Clustering method via Learnable\nAugmentation (\\textbf{AGCLA}), which introduces learnable augmentors for\nhigh-quality and suitable augmented samples for CDGC. Specifically, we design\ntwo learnable augmentors for attribute and structure information, respectively.\nBesides, two refinement matrices, including the high-confidence pseudo-label\nmatrix and the cross-view sample similarity matrix, are generated to improve\nthe reliability of the learned affinity matrix. During the training procedure,\nwe notice that there exist differences between the optimization goals for\ntraining learnable augmentors and contrastive learning networks. In other\nwords, we should both guarantee the consistency of the embeddings as well as\nthe diversity of the augmented samples. Thus, an adversarial learning mechanism\nis designed in our method. Moreover, a two-stage training strategy is leveraged\nfor the high-confidence refinement matrices. Extensive experimental results\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of AGCLA on six benchmark datasets.",

          "description": "Graph unlearning has emerged as a pivotal method to delete information from a\npre-trained graph neural network (GNN). One may delete nodes, a class of nodes,\nedges, or a class of edges. An unlearning method enables the GNN model to\ncomply with data protection regulations (i.e., the right to be forgotten),\nadapt to evolving data distributions, and reduce the GPU-hours carbon footprint\nby avoiding repetitive retraining. Existing partitioning and aggregation-based\nmethods have limitations due to their poor handling of local graph dependencies\nand additional overhead costs. More recently, GNNDelete offered a\nmodel-agnostic approach that alleviates some of these issues. Our work takes a\nnovel approach to address these challenges in graph unlearning through\nknowledge distillation, as it distills to delete in GNN (D2DGN). It is a\nmodel-agnostic distillation framework where the complete graph knowledge is\ndivided and marked for retention and deletion. It performs distillation with\nresponse-based soft targets and feature-based node embedding while minimizing\nKL divergence. The unlearned model effectively removes the influence of deleted\ngraph elements while preserving knowledge about the retained graph elements.\nD2DGN surpasses the performance of existing methods when evaluated on various\nreal-world graph datasets by up to $43.1\\%$ (AUC) in edge and node unlearning\ntasks. Other notable advantages include better efficiency, better performance\nin removing target elements, preservation of performance for the retained\nelements, and zero overhead costs. Notably, our D2DGN surpasses the\nstate-of-the-art GNNDelete in AUC by $2.4\\%$, improves membership inference\nratio by $+1.3$, requires $10.2\\times10^6$ fewer FLOPs per forward pass and up\nto $\\mathbf{3.2}\\times$ faster.",

          "description": "The primary bottleneck towards obtaining good recognition performance in IR\nimages is the lack of sufficient labeled training data, owing to the cost of\nacquiring such data. Realizing that object detection methods for the RGB\nmodality are quite robust (at least for some commonplace classes, like person,\ncar, etc.), thanks to the giant training sets that exist, in this work we seek\nto leverage cues from the RGB modality to scale object detectors to the IR\nmodality, while preserving model performance in the RGB modality. At the core\nof our method, is a novel tensor decomposition method called TensorFact which\nsplits the convolution kernels of a layer of a Convolutional Neural Network\n(CNN) into low-rank factor matrices, with fewer parameters than the original\nCNN. We first pretrain these factor matrices on the RGB modality, for which\nplenty of training data are assumed to exist and then augment only a few\ntrainable parameters for training on the IR modality to avoid over-fitting,\nwhile encouraging them to capture complementary cues from those trained only on\nthe RGB modality. We validate our approach empirically by first assessing how\nwell our TensorFact decomposed network performs at the task of detecting\nobjects in RGB images vis-a-vis the original network and then look at how well\nit adapts to IR images of the FLIR ADAS v1 dataset. For the latter, we train\nmodels under scenarios that pose challenges stemming from data paucity. From\nthe experiments, we observe that: (i) TensorFact shows performance gains on RGB\nimages; (ii) further, this pre-trained model, when fine-tuned, outperforms a\nstandard state-of-the-art object detector on the FLIR ADAS v1 dataset by about\n4% in terms of mAP 50 score.",

Recently, fair representation\nlearning (FRL) trained by deep neural networks has demonstrated superior\nperformance, whereby representations containing no demographic information are\ninferred from the data and then used as the input to classification or other\ndownstream tasks. Despite the development of FRL methods, their vulnerability\nunder data poisoning attack, a popular protocol to benchmark model robustness\nunder adversarial scenarios, is under-explored. Data poisoning attacks have\nbeen developed for classical fair machine learning methods which incorporate\nfairness constraints into shallow-model classifiers. Nonetheless, these attacks\nfall short in FRL due to notably different fairness goals and model\narchitectures. This work proposes the first data poisoning framework attacking\nFRL. We induce the model to output unfair representations that contain as much\ndemographic information as possible by injecting carefully crafted poisoning\nsamples into the training data. This attack entails a prohibitive bilevel\noptimization, wherefore an effective approximated solution is proposed. A\ntheoretical analysis on the needed number of poisoning samples is derived and\nsheds light on defending against the attack. Experiments on benchmark fairness\ndatasets and state-of-the-art fair representation learning models demonstrate\nthe superiority of our attack.",

It\nis well-established that Shamir secret-sharing coding strategies can enable\nperfect information-theoretic privacy in distributed computation via the\ncelebrated algorithm of Ben Or, Goldwasser and Wigderson (the \"BGW algorithm\").\nHowever, perfect privacy and accuracy require an honest majority, that is, $N\n\\geq 2t+1$ compute nodes are required to ensure privacy against any $t$\ncolluding adversarial nodes.

          "description": "Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong capabilities in various\naspects. However, when applying them to the highly specialized, safe-critical\nlegal domain, it is unclear how much legal knowledge they possess and whether\nthey can reliably perform legal-related tasks. To address this gap, we propose\na comprehensive evaluation benchmark LawBench. LawBench has been meticulously\ncrafted to have precise assessment of the LLMs' legal capabilities from three\ncognitive levels: (1) Legal knowledge memorization: whether LLMs can memorize\nneeded legal concepts, articles and facts; (2) Legal knowledge understanding:\nwhether LLMs can comprehend entities, events and relationships within legal\ntext; (3) Legal knowledge applying: whether LLMs can properly utilize their\nlegal knowledge and make necessary reasoning steps to solve realistic legal\ntasks. LawBench contains 20 diverse tasks covering 5 task types: single-label\nclassification (SLC), multi-label classification (MLC), regression, extraction\nand generation. We perform extensive evaluations of 51 LLMs on LawBench,\nincluding 20 multilingual LLMs, 22 Chinese-oriented LLMs and 9 legal specific\nLLMs. The results show that GPT-4 remains the best-performing LLM in the legal\ndomain, surpassing the others by a significant margin. While fine-tuning LLMs\non legal specific text brings certain improvements, we are still a long way\nfrom obtaining usable and reliable LLMs in legal tasks. All data, model\npredictions and evaluation code are released in\nhttps://github.com/open-compass/LawBench/. We hope this benchmark provides\nin-depth understanding of the LLMs' domain-specified capabilities and speed up\nthe development of LLMs in the legal domain.",

          "description": "Batch reinforcement learning (RL) defines the task of learning from a fixed\nbatch of data lacking exhaustive exploration. Worst-case optimality algorithms,\nwhich calibrate a value-function model class from logged experience and perform\nsome type of pessimistic evaluation under the learned model, have emerged as a\npromising paradigm for batch RL. However, contemporary works on this stream\nhave commonly overlooked the hierarchical decision-making structure hidden in\nthe optimization landscape. In this paper, we adopt a game-theoretical\nviewpoint and model the policy learning diagram as a two-player general-sum\ngame with a leader-follower structure. We propose a novel stochastic\ngradient-based learning algorithm: StackelbergLearner, in which the leader\nplayer updates according to the total derivative of its objective instead of\nthe usual individual gradient, and the follower player makes individual updates\nand ensures transition-consistent pessimistic reasoning. The derived learning\ndynamic naturally lends StackelbergLearner to a game-theoretic interpretation\nand provides a convergence guarantee to differentiable Stackelberg equilibria.\nFrom a theoretical standpoint, we provide instance-dependent regret bounds with\ngeneral function approximation, which shows that our algorithm can learn a\nbest-effort policy that is able to compete against any comparator policy that\nis covered by batch data. Notably, our theoretical regret guarantees only\nrequire realizability without any data coverage and strong function\napproximation conditions, e.g., Bellman closedness, which is in contrast to\nprior works lacking such guarantees. Through comprehensive experiments, we find\nthat our algorithm consistently performs as well or better as compared to\nstate-of-the-art methods in batch RL benchmark and real-world datasets.",

          "description": "Worldwide Geo-localization aims to pinpoint the precise location of images\ntaken anywhere on Earth. This task has considerable challenges due to immense\nvariation in geographic landscapes. The image-to-image retrieval-based\napproaches fail to solve this problem on a global scale as it is not feasible\nto construct a large gallery of images covering the entire world. Instead,\nexisting approaches divide the globe into discrete geographic cells,\ntransforming the problem into a classification task. However, their performance\nis limited by the predefined classes and often results in inaccurate\nlocalizations when an image's location significantly deviates from its class\ncenter. To overcome these limitations, we propose GeoCLIP, a novel\nCLIP-inspired Image-to-GPS retrieval approach that enforces alignment between\nthe image and its corresponding GPS locations. GeoCLIP's location encoder\nmodels the Earth as a continuous function by employing positional encoding\nthrough random Fourier features and constructing a hierarchical representation\nthat captures information at varying resolutions to yield a semantically rich\nhigh-dimensional feature suitable to use even beyond geo-localization. To the\nbest of our knowledge, this is the first work employing GPS encoding for\ngeo-localization. We demonstrate the efficacy of our method via extensive\nexperiments and ablations on benchmark datasets. We achieve competitive\nperformance with just 20% of training data, highlighting its effectiveness even\nin limited-data settings. Furthermore, we qualitatively demonstrate\ngeo-localization using a text query by leveraging CLIP backbone of our image\nencoder.",

          "description": "Auxiliary data sources have become increasingly important in epidemiological\nsurveillance, as they are often available at a finer spatial and temporal\nresolution, larger coverage, and lower latency than traditional surveillance\nsignals. We describe the problem of spatial and temporal heterogeneity in these\nsignals derived from these data sources, where spatial and/or temporal biases\nare present. We present a method to use a ``guiding'' signal to correct for\nthese biases and produce a more reliable signal that can be used for modeling\nand forecasting. The method assumes that the heterogeneity can be approximated\nby a low-rank matrix and that the temporal heterogeneity is smooth over time.\nWe also present a hyperparameter selection algorithm to choose the parameters\nrepresenting the matrix rank and degree of temporal smoothness of the\ncorrections. In the absence of ground truth, we use maps and plots to argue\nthat this method does indeed reduce heterogeneity.

Given the existence of data censoring,\nan effective way of survival analysis is to enforce the pairwise temporal\nconcordance between censored and observed data, aiming to utilize the time\ninterval before censoring as partially observed time-to-event labels for\nsupervised learning. Although existing studies mostly employed ranking methods\nto pursue an ordering objective, contrastive methods which learn a\ndiscriminative embedding by having data contrast against each other, have not\nbeen explored thoroughly for survival analysis. Therefore, in this paper, we\npropose a novel Ontology-aware Temporality-based Contrastive Survival (OTCSurv)\nanalysis framework that utilizes survival durations from both censored and\nobserved data to define temporal distinctiveness and construct negative sample\npairs with adjustable hardness for contrastive learning. Specifically, we first\nuse an ontological encoder and a sequential self-attention encoder to represent\nthe longitudinal EHR data with rich contexts. Second, we design a temporal\ncontrastive loss to capture varying survival durations in a supervised setting\nthrough a hardness-aware negative sampling mechanism. Last, we incorporate the\ncontrastive task into the time-to-event predictive task with multiple loss\ncomponents. We conduct extensive experiments using a large EHR dataset to\nforecast the risk of hospitalized patients who are in danger of developing\nacute kidney injury (AKI), a critical and urgent medical condition.

          "description": "Developing the next generation of household robot helpers requires combining\nlocomotion and interaction capabilities, which is generally referred to as\nmobile manipulation (MoMa). MoMa tasks are difficult due to the large action\nspace of the robot and the common multi-objective nature of the task, e.g.,\nefficiently reaching a goal while avoiding obstacles. Current approaches often\nsegregate tasks into navigation without manipulation and stationary\nmanipulation without locomotion by manually matching parts of the action space\nto MoMa sub-objectives (e.g. learning base actions for locomotion objectives\nand learning arm actions for manipulation). This solution prevents simultaneous\ncombinations of locomotion and interaction degrees of freedom and requires\nhuman domain knowledge for both partitioning the action space and matching the\naction parts to the sub-objectives. In this paper, we introduce Causal MoMa, a\nnew reinforcement learning framework to train policies for typical MoMa tasks\nthat makes use of the most favorable subspace of the robot's action space to\naddress each sub-objective. Causal MoMa automatically discovers the causal\ndependencies between actions and terms of the reward function and exploits\nthese dependencies through causal policy gradient that reduces gradient\nvariance compared to previous state-of-the-art reinforcement learning\nalgorithms, improving convergence and results. We evaluate the performance of\nCausal MoMa on three types of simulated robots across different MoMa tasks and\ndemonstrate success in transferring the policies trained in simulation directly\nto a real robot, where our agent is able to follow moving goals and react to\ndynamic obstacles while simultaneously and synergistically controlling the\nwhole-body: base, arm, and head.

Classifier circuits are so tiny\n(i.e., consisting of no more than 300 logic gates) that they are called \"Tiny\nClassifier\" circuits, and can efficiently be implemented in ASIC or on an FPGA.\nWe empirically evaluate the automatic Tiny Classifier circuit generation\nmethodology or \"Auto Tiny Classifiers\" on a wide range of tabular datasets, and\ncompare it against conventional ML techniques such as Amazon's AutoGluon,\nGoogle's TabNet and a neural search over Multi-Layer Perceptrons. Despite Tiny\nClassifiers being constrained to a few hundred logic gates, we observe no\nstatistically significant difference in prediction performance in comparison to\nthe best-performing ML baseline. When synthesised as a Silicon chip, Tiny\nClassifiers use 8-18x less area and 4-8x less power. When implemented as an\nultra-low cost chip on a flexible substrate (i.e., FlexIC), they occupy 10-75x\nless area and consume 13-75x less power compared to the most hardware-efficient\nML baseline. On an FPGA, Tiny Classifiers consume 3-11x fewer resources.",

          "description": "Contrastive learning is a self-supervised representation learning framework,\nwhere two positive views generated through data augmentation are made similar\nby an attraction force in a data representation space, while a repulsive force\nmakes them far from negative examples. Non-contrastive learning, represented by\nBYOL and SimSiam, further gets rid of negative examples and improves\ncomputational efficiency. While learned representations may collapse into a\nsingle point due to the lack of the repulsive force at first sight, Tian et al.\n(2021) revealed through the learning dynamics analysis that the representations\ncan avoid collapse if data augmentation is sufficiently stronger than\nregularization. However, their analysis does not take into account\ncommonly-used feature normalization, a normalizer before measuring the\nsimilarity of representations, and hence excessively strong regularization may\ncollapse the dynamics, which is an unnatural behavior under the presence of\nfeature normalization. Therefore, we extend the previous theory based on the L2\nloss by considering the cosine loss, which involves feature normalization. We\nshow that the cosine loss induces sixth-order dynamics (while the L2 loss\ninduces a third-order one), in which a stable equilibrium dynamically emerges\neven if there are only collapsed solutions with given initial parameters. Thus,\nwe offer a new understanding that feature normalization plays an important role\nin robustly preventing the dynamics collapse.",

Here we propose a new metaheuristic that drives dimensionality\nreductions from feature-informed transformations (DR-FFIT) to address these\nbottlenecks.

We use artificial\nneural networks to obtain differentiable proxies for the model's features of\ninterest. The resulting gradients enable the estimation of a local active\nsubspace of the model within a defined sampling region. This approach enables\nefficient dimensionality reductions of highly non-linear search spaces at a low\ncomputational cost.

Traditionally, this is done\nusing data augmentation or hard-coding invariances into the architecture.\nHowever, too much or too little invariance can hurt, and the correct amount is\nunknown a priori and dependent on the instance. Ideally, the appropriate\ninvariance would be learned from data and inferred at test-time.\n\nWe treat invariance as a prediction problem. Given any image, we use a\nnormalizing flow to predict a distribution over transformations and average the\npredictions over them. Since this distribution only depends on the instance, we\ncan align instances before classifying them and generalize invariance across\nclasses. The same distribution can also be used to adapt to out-of-distribution\nposes. This normalizing flow is trained end-to-end and can learn a much larger\nrange of transformations than Augerino and InstaAug.

In this paper, we introduce an UNcertainty-awaRE deciSion Transformer\n(UNREST) for planning in stochastic driving environments without introducing\nadditional transition or complex generative models. Specifically, UNREST\nestimates state uncertainties by the conditional mutual information between\ntransitions and returns, and segments sequences accordingly. Discovering the\n`uncertainty accumulation' and `temporal locality' properties of driving\nenvironments, UNREST replaces the global returns in decision transformers with\nless uncertain truncated returns, to learn from true outcomes of agent actions\nrather than environment transitions. We also dynamically evaluate environmental\nuncertainty during inference for cautious planning. Extensive experimental\nresults demonstrate UNREST's superior performance in various driving scenarios\nand the power of our uncertainty estimation strategy.",

For each data point, abductive explanations provide a\nminimal subset of features that are sufficient to generate the outcome. While\ntheoretically sound and rigorous, abductive explanations suffer from a major\nissue -- there can be several valid abductive explanations for the same data\npoint. In such cases, providing a single abductive explanation can be\ninsufficient; on the other hand, providing all valid abductive explanations can\nbe incomprehensible due to their size. In this work, we solve this issue by\naggregating the many possible abductive explanations into feature importance\nscores. We propose three aggregation methods: two based on power indices from\ncooperative game theory and a third based on a well-known measure of causal\nstrength. We characterize these three methods axiomatically, showing that each\nof them uniquely satisfies a set of desirable properties. We also evaluate them\non multiple datasets and show that these explanations are robust to the attacks\nthat fool SHAP and LIME.",

In this work,\nwe address the problem of learning a dissipative neural dynamical system model\nin two stages. First, we learn an unconstrained neural dynamical model that\nclosely approximates the system dynamics. Next, we derive sufficient conditions\nto perturb the weights of the neural dynamical model to ensure dissipativity,\nfollowed by perturbation of the biases to retain the fit of the model to the\ntrajectories of the nonlinear system.

          "description": "Progress in hybrid physics-machine learning (ML) climate simulations has been\nlimited by the difficulty of obtaining performant coupled (i.e. online)\nsimulations. While evaluating hundreds of ML parameterizations of subgrid\nclosures (here of convection and radiation) offline is straightforward, online\nevaluation at the same scale is technically challenging. Our software\nautomation achieves an order-of-magnitude larger sampling of online modeling\nerrors than has previously been examined. Using this, we evaluate the hybrid\nclimate model performance and define strategies to improve it. We show that\nmodel online performance improves when incorporating memory, a relative\nhumidity input feature transformation, and additional input variables. We also\nreveal substantial variation in online error and inconsistencies between\noffline vs. online error statistics. The implication is that hundreds of\ncandidate ML models should be evaluated online to detect the effects of\nparameterization design choices. This is considerably more sampling than tends\nto be reported in the current literature.",

          "description": "Most knowledge graph completion (KGC) methods learn latent representations of\nentities and relations of a given graph by mapping them into a vector space.\nAlthough the majority of these methods focus on static knowledge graphs, a\nlarge number of publicly available KGs contain temporal information stating the\ntime instant/period over which a certain fact has been true. Such graphs are\noften known as temporal knowledge graphs. Furthermore, knowledge graphs may\nalso contain textual descriptions of entities and relations. Both temporal\ninformation and textual descriptions are not taken into account during\nrepresentation learning by static KGC methods, and only structural information\nof the graph is leveraged. Recently, some studies have used temporal\ninformation to improve link prediction, yet they do not exploit textual\ndescriptions and do not support inductive inference (prediction on entities\nthat have not been seen in training).\n\nWe propose a novel framework called TEMT that exploits the power of\npre-trained language models (PLMs) for text-enhanced temporal knowledge graph\ncompletion. The knowledge stored in the parameters of a PLM allows TEMT to\nproduce rich semantic representations of facts and to generalize on previously\nunseen entities. TEMT leverages textual and temporal information available in a\nKG, treats them separately, and fuses them to get plausibility scores of facts.\nUnlike previous approaches, TEMT effectively captures dependencies across\ndifferent time points and enables predictions on unseen entities. To assess the\nperformance of TEMT, we carried out several experiments including time interval\nprediction, both in transductive and inductive settings, and triple\nclassification.

Furthermore, we\nexplored alternative neural architectures and approaches to incorporating\nbiological information into the networks. We experimented with three types of\ngraph neural networks on the same training data, and investigated the clinical\nprediction agreement between different models. Our analyses demonstrated that\ndeep neural networks with distinct architectures make incorrect predictions for\nindividual patient that are persistent across different initializations of a\nspecific neural architecture.

During\nthe early days of the pandemic, one of the biggest challenges we faced was the\nlack of peer-reviewed biomedical articles on COVID-19 that could be used to\ntrain machine learning models for question answering (QA). In this paper, we\nexplore the roles weak supervision and data augmentation play in training deep\nneural network QA models. First, we investigate whether labels generated\nautomatically from the structured abstracts of scholarly papers using an\ninformation retrieval algorithm, BM25, provide a weak supervision signal to\ntrain an extractive QA model. We also curate new QA pairs using information\nretrieval techniques, guided by the clinicaltrials.gov schema and the\nstructured abstracts of articles, in the absence of annotated data from\nbiomedical domain experts. Furthermore, we explore augmenting the training data\nof a deep neural network model with linguistic features from external sources\nsuch as lexical databases to account for variations in word morphology and\nmeaning. To better utilize our training data, we apply curriculum learning to\ndomain adaptation, fine-tuning our QA model in stages based on characteristics\nof the QA pairs. We evaluate our methods in the context of QA models at the\ncore of a system to answer questions about COVID-19.",

Machine learning methods have shown promising results in\nevaluating the risk of developing atrial fibrillation from the\nelectrocardiogram. We aim to develop and evaluate one such algorithm on a large\nCODE dataset collected in Brazil.\n\nResults: The deep neural network model identified patients without indication\nof AF in the presented ECG but who will develop AF in the future with an AUC\nscore of 0.845. From our survival model, we obtain that patients in the\nhigh-risk group (i.e. with the probability of a future AF case being greater\nthan 0.7) are 50% more likely to develop AF within 40 weeks, while patients\nbelonging to the minimal-risk group (i.e. with the probability of a future AF\ncase being less than or equal to 0.1) have more than 85% chance of remaining AF\nfree up until after seven years.\n\nConclusion: We developed and validated a model for AF risk prediction. If\napplied in clinical practice, the model possesses the potential of providing\nvaluable and useful information in decision-making and patient management\nprocesses.",

          "description": "Decoding memory content from brain activity during sleep has long been a goal\nin neuroscience. While spontaneous reactivation of memories during sleep in\nrodents is known to support memory consolidation and offline learning,\ncapturing memory replay in humans is challenging due to the absence of\nwell-annotated sleep datasets and the substantial differences in neural\npatterns between wakefulness and sleep. To address these challenges, we\ndesigned a novel cognitive neuroscience experiment and collected a\ncomprehensive, well-annotated electroencephalography (EEG) dataset from 52\nsubjects during both wakefulness and sleep. Leveraging this benchmark dataset,\nwe developed the Universal Sleep Decoder (USD) to align neural representations\nbetween wakefulness and sleep across subjects. Our model achieves up to 16.6%\ntop-1 zero-shot accuracy on unseen subjects, comparable to decoding\nperformances using individual sleep data. Furthermore, fine-tuning USD on test\nsubjects enhances decoding accuracy to 25.9% top-1 accuracy, a substantial\nimprovement over the baseline chance of 6.7%. Model comparison and ablation\nanalyses reveal that our design choices, including the use of (i) an additional\ncontrastive objective to integrate awake and sleep neural signals and (ii) the\npretrain-finetune paradigm to incorporate different subjects, significantly\ncontribute to these performances. Collectively, our findings and methodologies\nrepresent a significant advancement in the field of sleep decoding.",

          "description": "Robots with increasing autonomy progress our space exploration capabilities,\nparticularly for in-situ exploration and sampling to stand in for human\nexplorers. Currently, humans drive robots to meet scientific objectives, but\ndepending on the robot's location, the exchange of information and driving\ncommands between the human operator and robot may cause undue delays in mission\nfulfillment. An autonomous robot encoded with a scientific objective and an\nexploration strategy incurs no communication delays and can fulfill missions\nmore quickly. Active learning algorithms offer this capability of intelligent\nexploration, but the underlying model structure varies the performance of the\nactive learning algorithm in accurately forming an understanding of the\nenvironment. In this paper, we investigate the performance differences between\nactive learning algorithms driven by Gaussian processes or Bayesian neural\nnetworks for exploration strategies encoded on agents that are constrained in\ntheir trajectories, like planetary surface rovers. These two active learning\nstrategies were tested in a simulation environment against science-blind\nstrategies to predict the spatial distribution of a variable of interest along\nmultiple datasets. The performance metrics of interest are model accuracy in\nroot mean squared (RMS) error, training time, model convergence, total distance\ntraveled until convergence, and total samples until convergence. Active\nlearning strategies encoded with Gaussian processes require less computation to\ntrain, converge to an accurate model more quickly, and propose trajectories of\nshorter distance, except in a few complex environments in which Bayesian neural\nnetworks achieve a more accurate model in the large data regime due to their\nmore expressive functional bases. The paper concludes with advice on when and\nhow to implement either exploration strategy for future space missions.",

          "description": "Recent advances in federated learning (FL) enable collaborative training of\nmachine learning (ML) models from large-scale and widely dispersed clients\nwhile protecting their privacy. However, when different clients' datasets are\nheterogeneous, traditional FL mechanisms produce a global model that does not\nadequately represent the poorer clients with limited data resources, resulting\nin lower accuracy and higher bias on their local data. According to the Matthew\neffect, which describes how the advantaged gain more advantage and the\ndisadvantaged lose more over time, deploying such a global model in client\napplications may worsen the resource disparity among the clients and harm the\nprinciples of social welfare and fairness. To mitigate the Matthew effect, we\npropose Egalitarian Fairness Federated Learning (EFFL), where egalitarian\nfairness refers to the global model learned from FL has: (1) equal accuracy\namong clients; (2) equal decision bias among clients. Besides achieving\negalitarian fairness among the clients, EFFL also aims for performance\noptimality, minimizing the empirical risk loss and the bias for each client;\nboth are essential for any ML model training, whether centralized or\ndecentralized. We formulate EFFL as a constrained multi-constrained\nmulti-objectives optimization (MCMOO) problem, with the decision bias and\negalitarian fairness as constraints and the minimization of the empirical risk\nlosses on all clients as multiple objectives to be optimized. We propose a\ngradient-based three-stage algorithm to obtain the Pareto optimal solutions\nwithin the constraint space. Extensive experiments demonstrate that EFFL\noutperforms other state-of-the-art FL algorithms in achieving a\nhigh-performance global model with enhanced egalitarian fairness among all\nclients.",

          "description": "Bayesian optimization (BO) is a popular black-box function optimization\nmethod, which makes sequential decisions based on a Bayesian model, typically a\nGaussian process (GP), of the function. To ensure the quality of the model,\ntransfer learning approaches have been developed to automatically design GP\npriors by learning from observations on \"training\" functions. These training\nfunctions are typically required to have the same domain as the \"test\" function\n(black-box function to be optimized). In this paper, we introduce MPHD, a model\npre-training method on heterogeneous domains, which uses a neural net mapping\nfrom domain-specific contexts to specifications of hierarchical GPs. MPHD can\nbe seamlessly integrated with BO to transfer knowledge across heterogeneous\nsearch spaces. Our theoretical and empirical results demonstrate the validity\nof MPHD and its superior performance on challenging black-box function\noptimization tasks.",

          "description": "The increasing capabilities of large language models (LLMs) raise\nopportunities for artificial general intelligence but concurrently amplify\nsafety concerns, such as potential misuse of AI systems, necessitating\neffective AI alignment. Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) has\nemerged as a promising pathway towards AI alignment but brings forth challenges\ndue to its complexity and dependence on a separate reward model. Direct\nPreference Optimization (DPO) has been proposed as an alternative, and it\nremains equivalent to RLHF under the reverse KL regularization constraint. This\npaper presents $f$-DPO, a generalized approach to DPO by incorporating diverse\ndivergence constraints. We show that under certain $f$-divergences, including\nJensen-Shannon divergence, forward KL divergences and $\\alpha$-divergences, the\ncomplex relationship between the reward and optimal policy can also be\nsimplified by addressing the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker conditions. This eliminates the\nneed for estimating the normalizing constant in the Bradley-Terry model and\nenables a tractable mapping between the reward function and the optimal policy.\nOur approach optimizes LLMs to align with human preferences in a more efficient\nand supervised manner under a broad set of divergence constraints. Empirically,\nadopting these divergences ensures a balance between alignment performance and\ngeneration diversity. Importantly, $f$-DPO outperforms PPO-based methods in\ndivergence efficiency, and divergence constraints directly influence expected\ncalibration error (ECE).",

          "description": "Time series data can be found in almost every domain, ranging from the\nmedical field to manufacturing and wireless communication. Generating realistic\nand useful exemplars and prototypes is a fundamental data analysis task. In\nthis paper, we investigate a novel approach to generating realistic and useful\nexemplars and prototypes for time series data. Our approach uses a new form of\ntime series average, the ShapeDTW Barycentric Average. We therefore turn our\nattention to accurately generating time series prototypes with a novel\napproach. The existing time series prototyping approaches rely on the Dynamic\nTime Warping (DTW) similarity measure such as DTW Barycentering Average (DBA)\nand SoftDBA. These last approaches suffer from a common problem of generating\nout-of-distribution artifacts in their prototypes. This is mostly caused by the\nDTW variant used and its incapability of detecting neighborhood similarities,\ninstead it detects absolute similarities. Our proposed method, ShapeDBA, uses\nthe ShapeDTW variant of DTW, that overcomes this issue. We chose time series\nclustering, a popular form of time series analysis to evaluate the outcome of\nShapeDBA compared to the other prototyping approaches. Coupled with the k-means\nclustering algorithm, and evaluated on a total of 123 datasets from the UCR\narchive, our proposed averaging approach is able to achieve new\nstate-of-the-art results in terms of Adjusted Rand Index.",

          "description": "The standard paired-sample testing approach in the multidimensional setting\napplies multiple univariate tests on the individual features, followed by\np-value adjustments. Such an approach suffers when the data carry numerous\nfeatures. A number of studies have shown that classification accuracy can be\nseen as a proxy for two-sample testing. However, neither theoretical\nfoundations nor practical recipes have been proposed so far on how this\nstrategy could be extended to multidimensional paired-sample testing. In this\nwork, we put forward the idea that scoring functions can be produced by the\ndecision rules defined by the perpendicular bisecting hyperplanes of the line\nsegments connecting each pair of instances. Then, the optimal scoring function\ncan be obtained by the pseudomedian of those rules, which we estimate by\nextending naturally the Hodges-Lehmann estimator. We accordingly propose a\nframework of a two-step testing procedure. First, we estimate the bisecting\nhyperplanes for each pair of instances and an aggregated rule derived through\nthe Hodges-Lehmann estimator. The paired samples are scored by this aggregated\nrule to produce a unidimensional representation. Second, we perform a Wilcoxon\nsigned-rank test on the obtained representation. Our experiments indicate that\nour approach has substantial performance gains in testing accuracy compared to\nthe traditional multivariate and multiple testing, while at the same time\nestimates each feature's contribution to the final result.",

          "description": "Diverse explainability methods of graph neural networks (GNN) have recently\nbeen developed to highlight the edges and nodes in the graph that contribute\nthe most to the model predictions. However, it is not clear yet how to evaluate\nthe correctness of those explanations, whether it is from a human or a model\nperspective. One unaddressed bottleneck in the current evaluation procedure is\nthe problem of out-of-distribution explanations, whose distribution differs\nfrom those of the training data. This important issue affects existing\nevaluation metrics such as the popular faithfulness or fidelity score. In this\npaper, we show the limitations of faithfulness metrics. We propose GInX-Eval\n(Graph In-distribution eXplanation Evaluation), an evaluation procedure of\ngraph explanations that overcomes the pitfalls of faithfulness and offers new\ninsights on explainability methods. Using a retraining strategy, the GInX score\nmeasures how informative removed edges are for the model and the EdgeRank score\nevaluates if explanatory edges are correctly ordered by their importance.\nGInX-Eval verifies if ground-truth explanations are instructive to the GNN\nmodel. In addition, it shows that many popular methods, including\ngradient-based methods, produce explanations that are not better than a random\ndesignation of edges as important subgraphs, challenging the findings of\ncurrent works in the area.

          "description": "In representation learning, regression has traditionally received less\nattention than classification. Directly applying representation learning\ntechniques designed for classification to regression often results in\nfragmented representations in the latent space, yielding sub-optimal\nperformance. In this paper, we argue that the potential of contrastive learning\nfor regression has been overshadowed due to the neglect of two crucial aspects:\nordinality-awareness and hardness. To address these challenges, we advocate\n\"mixup your own contrastive pairs for supervised contrastive regression\",\ninstead of relying solely on real/augmented samples. Specifically, we propose\nSupervised Contrastive Learning for Regression with Mixup (SupReMix). It takes\nanchor-inclusive mixtures (mixup of the anchor and a distinct negative sample)\nas hard negative pairs and anchor-exclusive mixtures (mixup of two distinct\nnegative samples) as hard positive pairs at the embedding level. This strategy\nformulates harder contrastive pairs by integrating richer ordinal information.\nThrough extensive experiments on six regression datasets including 2D images,\nvolumetric images, text, tabular data, and time-series signals, coupled with\ntheoretical analysis, we demonstrate that SupReMix pre-training fosters\ncontinuous ordered representations of regression data, resulting in significant\nimprovement in regression performance. Furthermore, SupReMix is superior to\nother approaches in a range of regression challenges including transfer\nlearning, imbalanced training data, and scenarios with fewer training samples.",

          "description": "Standard practice within Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF)\ninvolves optimizing against a Reward Model (RM), which itself is trained to\nreflect human preferences for desirable generations. A notable subject that is\nunderstudied is the (in-)consistency of RMs -- whether they can recognize the\nsemantic changes to different prompts and appropriately adapt their reward\nassignments -- and their impact on the downstream RLHF model.\n\nIn this paper, we visit a series of research questions relevant to RM\ninconsistency: (1) How can we measure the consistency of reward models? (2) How\nconsistent are the existing RMs and how can we improve them? (3) In what ways\ndoes reward inconsistency influence the chatbots resulting from the RLHF model\ntraining?\n\nWe propose Contrast Instructions -- a benchmarking strategy for the\nconsistency of RM. Each example in Contrast Instructions features a pair of\nlexically similar instructions with different ground truth responses. A\nconsistent RM is expected to rank the corresponding instruction and response\nhigher than other combinations. We observe that current RMs trained with the\nstandard ranking objective fail miserably on Contrast Instructions compared to\naverage humans. To show that RM consistency can be improved efficiently without\nusing extra training budget, we propose two techniques ConvexDA and\nRewardFusion, which enhance reward consistency through extrapolation during the\nRM training and inference stage, respectively. We show that RLHF models trained\nwith a more consistent RM yield more useful responses, suggesting that reward\ninconsistency exhibits a trickle-down effect on the downstream RLHF process.",

          "description": "Anomaly detection is critical to ensure the security of cyber-physical\nsystems (CPS). However, due to the increasing complexity of attacks and CPS\nthemselves, anomaly detection in CPS is becoming more and more challenging. In\nour previous work, we proposed a digital twin-based anomaly detection method,\ncalled ATTAIN, which takes advantage of both historical and real-time data of\nCPS. However, such data vary significantly in terms of difficulty. Therefore,\nsimilar to human learning processes, deep learning models (e.g., ATTAIN) can\nbenefit from an easy-to-difficult curriculum. To this end, in this paper, we\npresent a novel approach, named digitaL twin-based Anomaly deTecTion wIth\nCurriculum lEarning (LATTICE), which extends ATTAIN by introducing curriculum\nlearning to optimize its learning paradigm. LATTICE attributes each sample with\na difficulty score, before being fed into a training scheduler. The training\nscheduler samples batches of training data based on these difficulty scores\nsuch that learning from easy to difficult data can be performed. To evaluate\nLATTICE, we use five publicly available datasets collected from five real-world\nCPS testbeds. We compare LATTICE with ATTAIN and two other state-of-the-art\nanomaly detectors. Evaluation results show that LATTICE outperforms the three\nbaselines and ATTAIN by 0.906%-2.367% in terms of the F1 score. LATTICE also,\non average, reduces the training time of ATTAIN by 4.2% on the five datasets\nand is on par with the baselines in terms of detection delay time.",

Our analysis,\nbased on data collected from 669 patients across various provinces in Iraq,\nyielded valuable insights. We found that age, gender, and geographical region\nof residence were significant demographic factors influencing the likelihood of\ndeveloping mental health disorders in post-COVID-19 patients. Additionally,\ncomorbidities and the severity of COVID-19 illness were important clinical\npredictors. Psychosocial factors, such as social support, coping strategies,\nand perceived stress levels, also played a substantial role. Our findings\nemphasize the complex interplay of multiple factors in the development of\nmental health disorders following COVID-19 recovery. Healthcare providers and\npolicymakers should consider these risk factors when designing targeted\ninterventions and support systems for individuals at risk. Machine\nlearning-based approaches can provide a valuable tool for predicting and\npreventing adverse mental health outcomes in post-COVID-19 patients. Further\nresearch and prospective studies are needed to validate these findings and\nenhance our understanding of the long-term psychological impact of the COVID-19\npandemic.

          "description": "Decision forests are widely used for classification and regression tasks. A\nlesser known property of tree-based methods is that one can construct a\nproximity matrix from the tree(s), and these proximity matrices are induced\nkernels. While there has been extensive research on the applications and\nproperties of kernels, there is relatively little research on kernels induced\nby decision forests. We construct Kernel Mean Embedding Random Forests (KMERF),\nwhich induce kernels from random trees and/or forests using leaf-node\nproximity. We introduce the notion of an asymptotically characteristic kernel,\nand prove that KMERF kernels are asymptotically characteristic for both\ndiscrete and continuous data. Because KMERF is data-adaptive, we suspected it\nwould outperform kernels selected a priori on finite sample data. We illustrate\nthat KMERF nearly dominates current state-of-the-art kernel-based tests across\na diverse range of high-dimensional two-sample and independence testing\nsettings. Furthermore, our forest-based approach is interpretable, and provides\nfeature importance metrics that readily distinguish important dimensions,\nunlike other high-dimensional non-parametric testing procedures. Hence, this\nwork demonstrates the decision forest-based kernel can be more powerful and\nmore interpretable than existing methods, flying in the face of conventional\nwisdom of the trade-off between the two.",

          "description": "Modern DNN-based recommendation systems rely on training-derived embeddings\nof sparse features. Input sparsity makes obtaining high-quality embeddings for\nrarely-occurring categories harder as their representations are updated\ninfrequently. We demonstrate a training-time technique to produce superior\nembeddings via effective cross-category learning and theoretically explain its\nsurprising effectiveness. The scheme, termed the multi-layer embeddings\ntraining (MLET), trains embeddings using factorization of the embedding layer,\nwith an inner dimension higher than the target embedding dimension. For\ninference efficiency, MLET converts the trained two-layer embedding into a\nsingle-layer one thus keeping inference-time model size unchanged.\n\nEmpirical superiority of MLET is puzzling as its search space is not larger\nthan that of the single-layer embedding. The strong dependence of MLET on the\ninner dimension is even more surprising. We develop a theory that explains both\nof these behaviors by showing that MLET creates an adaptive update mechanism\nmodulated by the singular vectors of embeddings. When tested on multiple\nstate-of-the-art recommendation models for click-through rate (CTR) prediction\ntasks, MLET consistently produces better models, especially for rare items. At\nconstant model quality, MLET allows embedding dimension, and model size,\nreduction by up to 16x, and 5.8x on average, across the models.",

In turn, the more surprising\nthe information required to defined the claim, the narrower its scope. Five\nlanguage models are considered, ranging from simplest models (each word or\ncharacter is assigned an identical probability) to intermediate models (using\naverage word or character frequencies), to a large language model (GPT2).\nInterestingly, the scope resulting from the simplest language models is\nproportional to the reciprocal of the number of words or characters involved in\nthe claim, a metric already used in previous works. Application is made to\nmultiple series of patent claims directed to distinct inventions, where each\nseries consists of claims devised to have a gradually decreasing scope. The\nperformance of the language models is assessed with respect to several ad hoc\ntests. The more sophisticated the model, the better the results.

          "description": "We propose a memory-efficient finetuning algorithm for large language models\n(LLMs) that supports finetuning LLMs with 65B parameters in 3-bit or 4-bit\nprecision on as little as one 48GB GPU. Our method, modular low-rank adaptation\n(ModuLoRA), integrates any user-specified weight quantizer with finetuning via\nlow-rank adapters (LoRAs). Our approach relies on a simple\nquantization-agnostic backward pass that adaptively materializes low-precision\nLLM weights from a custom black-box quantization module. This approach enables\nfinetuning 3-bit LLMs for the first time--leveraging state-of-the-art 3-bit\nOPTQ quantization often outperforms finetuning that relies on less\nsophisticated 4-bit and 8-bit methods. In our experiments, ModuLoRA attains\ncompetitive performance on text classification, natural language infernece, and\ninstruction following tasks using significantly less memory than existing\napproaches, and we also surpass the state-of-the-art ROUGE score on a popular\nsummarization task. We release ModuLoRA together with a series of low-precision\nmodels--including the first family of 3-bit instruction following Alpaca\nLLMs--as part of LLMTOOLS, a user-friendly library for quantizing, running, and\nfinetuning LLMs on consumer GPUs.",

Federated Learning (FL) emerges as a potential paradigm,\nfacilitating decentralized AI model training across a diverse range of devices\nunder the coordination of a central server. However, several challenges hinder\nits wide application in the 6G context, such as malicious attacks and privacy\nsnooping on local model updates, and centralization pitfalls. This work\nproposes a trusted architecture for supporting FL, which utilizes Distributed\nLedger Technology (DLT) and Graph Neural Network (GNN), including three key\nfeatures. First, a pre-processing layer employing homomorphic encryption is\nincorporated to securely aggregate local models, preserving the privacy of\nindividual models. Second, given the distributed nature and graph structure\nbetween clients and nodes in the pre-processing layer, GNN is leveraged to\nidentify abnormal local models, enhancing system security. Third, DLT is\nutilized to decentralize the system by selecting one of the candidates to\nperform the central server's functions. Additionally, DLT ensures reliable data\nmanagement by recording data exchanges in an immutable and transparent ledger.\nThe feasibility of the novel architecture is validated through simulations,\ndemonstrating improved performance in anomalous model detection and global\nmodel accuracy compared to relevant baselines.",

The results confirm some observations made in machine\nlearning practice, but also lead to unexpected findings: Data augmentation may\nincrease rather than decrease the uncertainty of estimates, such as the\nempirical prediction risk. It can act as a regularizer, but fails to do so in\ncertain high-dimensional problems, and it may shift the double-descent peak of\nan empirical risk. Overall, the analysis shows that several properties data\naugmentation has been attributed with are not either true or false, but rather\ndepend on a combination of factors -- notably the data distribution, the\nproperties of the estimator, and the interplay of sample size, number of\naugmentations, and dimension.

In precision medicine, these nanodevices show promise\nfor disease diagnostics, treatment, and monitoring from within the patients'\nbloodstreams. Assigning the location of a sensed biological event with the\nevent itself, which is the main proposition of flow-guided in-body nanoscale\nlocalization, would be immensely beneficial from the perspective of precision\nmedicine. The nanoscale nature of the nanodevices and the challenging\nenvironment that the bloodstream represents, result in current flow-guided\nlocalization approaches being constrained in their communication and\nenergy-related capabilities. The communication and energy constraints of the\nnanodevices result in different features of raw data for flow-guided\nlocalization, in turn affecting its performance. An analytical modeling of the\neffects of imperfect communication and constrained energy causing intermittent\noperation of the nanodevices on the raw data produced by the nanodevices would\nbe beneficial. Hence, we propose an analytical model of raw data for\nflow-guided localization, where the raw data is modeled as a function of\ncommunication and energy-related capabilities of the nanodevice. We evaluate\nthe model by comparing its output with the one obtained through the utilization\nof a simulator for objective evaluation of flow-guided localization, featuring\ncomparably higher level of realism.

          "description": "Many real-world processes have complex tail dependence structures that cannot\nbe characterized using classical Gaussian processes. More flexible spatial\nextremes models exhibit appealing extremal dependence properties but are often\nexceedingly prohibitive to fit and simulate from in high dimensions. In this\npaper, we develop a new spatial extremes model that has flexible and\nnon-stationary dependence properties, and we integrate it in the\nencoding-decoding structure of a variational autoencoder (XVAE), whose\nparameters are estimated via variational Bayes combined with deep learning. The\nXVAE can be used as a spatio-temporal emulator that characterizes the\ndistribution of potential mechanistic model output states and produces outputs\nthat have the same statistical properties as the inputs, especially in the\ntail. As an aside, our approach also provides a novel way of making fast\ninference with complex extreme-value processes. Through extensive simulation\nstudies, we show that our XVAE is substantially more time-efficient than\ntraditional Bayesian inference while also outperforming many spatial extremes\nmodels with a stationary dependence structure. To further demonstrate the\ncomputational power of the XVAE, we analyze a high-resolution satellite-derived\ndataset of sea surface temperature in the Red Sea, which includes 30 years of\ndaily measurements at 16703 grid cells. We find that the extremal dependence\nstrength is weaker in the interior of Red Sea and it has decreased slightly\nover time.",

          "description": "The well-known governing physics in science and engineering is often based on\ncertain assumptions and approximations. Therefore, analyses and designs carried\nout based on these equations are also approximate. The emergence of data-driven\nmodels has, to a certain degree, addressed this challenge; however, the purely\ndata-driven models often (a) lack interpretability, (b) are data-hungry, and\n(c) do not generalize beyond the training window. Operator learning has\nrecently been proposed as a potential alternative to address the aforementioned\nchallenges; however, the challenges are still persistent. We here argue that\none of the possible solutions resides in data-physics fusion, where the\ndata-driven model is used to correct/identify the missing physics. To that end,\nwe propose a novel Differentiable Physics Augmented Wavelet Neural Operator\n(DPA-WNO). The proposed DPA-WNO blends a differentiable physics solver with the\nWavelet Neural Operator (WNO), where the role of WNO is to model the missing\nphysics. This empowers the proposed framework to exploit the capability of WNO\nto learn from data while retaining the interpretability and generalizability\nassociated with physics-based solvers. We illustrate the applicability of the\nproposed approach in solving time-dependent uncertainty quantification problems\ndue to randomness in the initial condition. Four benchmark uncertainty\nquantification and reliability analysis examples from various fields of science\nand engineering are solved using the proposed approach.

          "description": "Provenance graphs are structured audit logs that describe the history of a\nsystem's execution. Recent studies have explored a variety of techniques to\nanalyze provenance graphs for automated host intrusion detection, focusing\nparticularly on advanced persistent threats. Sifting through their design\ndocuments, we identify four common dimensions that drive the development of\nprovenance-based intrusion detection systems (PIDSes): scope (can PIDSes detect\nmodern attacks that infiltrate across application boundaries?), attack\nagnosticity (can PIDSes detect novel attacks without a priori knowledge of\nattack characteristics?), timeliness (can PIDSes efficiently monitor host\nsystems as they run?), and attack reconstruction (can PIDSes distill attack\nactivity from large provenance graphs so that sysadmins can easily understand\nand quickly respond to system intrusion?). We present KAIROS, the first PIDS\nthat simultaneously satisfies the desiderata in all four dimensions, whereas\nexisting approaches sacrifice at least one and struggle to achieve comparable\ndetection performance.\n\nKairos leverages a novel graph neural network-based encoder-decoder\narchitecture that learns the temporal evolution of a provenance graph's\nstructural changes to quantify the degree of anomalousness for each system\nevent. Then, based on this fine-grained information, Kairos reconstructs attack\nfootprints, generating compact summary graphs that accurately describe\nmalicious activity over a stream of system audit logs. Using state-of-the-art\nbenchmark datasets, we demonstrate that Kairos outperforms previous approaches.",

However, as machine\nlearning algorithms are applied in new contexts the harms and injustices that\nresult are qualitatively different than those presently studied. The existing\nresearch paradigm in machine learning which develops metrics and definitions of\nfairness cannot account for these qualitatively different types of injustice.\nOne example of this is the problem of algorithmic collusion and market\nfairness. The negative consequences of algorithmic collusion affect all\nconsumers, not only particular members of a protected class. Drawing on this\ncase study, I propose an ethical framework for researchers and practitioners in\nmachine learning seeking to develop and apply fairness metrics that extends to\nnew domains.

For example, if one wants to find roots,\nand one chooses initial points in the basin of attraction for 1 root $x^*$ (a\nfact which one may not know before hand), then one will always end up in that\nroot. In this case, one would like to have a mechanism to avoid this point\n$z^*$ in the next runs of one's algorithm.\n\nIn this paper, we propose two new methods aiming to achieve this. In the\nfirst method, we divide the cost function by an appropriate power of the\ndistance function to $A$. This idea is inspired by how one would try to find\nall roots of a function in 1 variable. In the second method, which is more\nsuitable for constrained optimization, we redefine the value of the function to\nbe a big constant on $A$. We also propose, based on this, an algorithm to\nescape the basin of attraction of a component of positive dimension to reach\nanother component. As an application, we prove a rigorous guarantee for finding\nroots of a meromorphic function of 1 complex variable in a given domain.\n\nAlong the way, we compare with main existing relevant methods in the current\nliterature.

Non-prehensile\nmanipulation may enable more complex interactions with the objects, but also\npresents challenges in reasoning about gripper-object interactions. In this\nwork, we introduce Hybrid Actor-Critic Maps for Manipulation (HACMan), a\nreinforcement learning approach for 6D non-prehensile manipulation of objects\nusing point cloud observations. HACMan proposes a temporally-abstracted and\nspatially-grounded object-centric action representation that consists of\nselecting a contact location from the object point cloud and a set of motion\nparameters describing how the robot will move after making contact. We modify\nan existing off-policy RL algorithm to learn in this hybrid discrete-continuous\naction representation.

          "description": "In response to recent data regulation requirements, machine unlearning (MU)\nhas emerged as a critical process to remove the influence of specific examples\nfrom a given model. Although exact unlearning can be achieved through complete\nmodel retraining using the remaining dataset, the associated computational\ncosts have driven the development of efficient, approximate unlearning\ntechniques. Moving beyond data-centric MU approaches, our study introduces a\nnovel model-based perspective: model sparsification via weight pruning, which\nis capable of reducing the gap between exact unlearning and approximate\nunlearning. We show in both theory and practice that model sparsity can boost\nthe multi-criteria unlearning performance of an approximate unlearner, closing\nthe approximation gap, while continuing to be efficient. This leads to a new MU\nparadigm, termed prune first, then unlearn, which infuses a sparse model prior\ninto the unlearning process. Building on this insight, we also develop a\nsparsity-aware unlearning method that utilizes sparsity regularization to\nenhance the training process of approximate unlearning. Extensive experiments\nshow that our proposals consistently benefit MU in various unlearning\nscenarios. A notable highlight is the 77% unlearning efficacy gain of\nfine-tuning (one of the simplest unlearning methods) when using sparsity-aware\nunlearning. Furthermore, we demonstrate the practical impact of our proposed MU\nmethods in addressing other machine learning challenges, such as defending\nagainst backdoor attacks and enhancing transfer learning.

Leveraging simple proofs, we are able to\nobtain tighter results than existing results \\citep{faw2022power} and extend\nthe analysis to several new and important cases. Specifically, for the\nover-parameterized regime, we show that AdaGrad needs only\n$\\mathcal{O}(\\frac{1}{\\varepsilon^2})$ iterations to ensure the gradient norm\nsmaller than $\\varepsilon$, which matches the rate of SGD and significantly\ntighter than existing rates $\\mathcal{O}(\\frac{1}{\\varepsilon^4})$ for AdaGrad.\nWe then discard the bounded smoothness assumption and consider a realistic\nassumption on smoothness called $(L_0,L_1)$-smooth condition, which allows\nlocal smoothness to grow with the gradient norm. Again based on the auxiliary\nfunction $\\xi$, we prove that AdaGrad succeeds in converging under\n$(L_0,L_1)$-smooth condition as long as the learning rate is lower than a\nthreshold. Interestingly, we further show that the requirement on learning rate\nunder the $(L_0,L_1)$-smooth condition is necessary via proof by contradiction,\nin contrast with the case of uniform smoothness conditions where convergence is\nguaranteed regardless of learning rate choices.

          "description": "We study differentially private (DP) stochastic optimization (SO) with loss\nfunctions whose worst-case Lipschitz parameter over all data points may be\nextremely large. To date, the vast majority of work on DP SO assumes that the\nloss is uniformly Lipschitz continuous over data (i.e. stochastic gradients are\nuniformly bounded over all data points). While this assumption is convenient,\nit often leads to pessimistic excess risk bounds. In many practical problems,\nthe worst-case (uniform) Lipschitz parameter of the loss over all data points\nmay be extremely large due to outliers. In such cases, the error bounds for DP\nSO, which scale with the worst-case Lipschitz parameter of the loss, are\nvacuous. To address these limitations, this work provides near-optimal excess\nrisk bounds that do not depend on the uniform Lipschitz parameter of the loss.\nBuilding on a recent line of work (Wang et al., 2020; Kamath et al., 2022), we\nassume that stochastic gradients have bounded $k$-th order moments for some $k\n\\geq 2$. Compared with works on uniformly Lipschitz DP SO, our excess risk\nscales with the $k$-th moment bound instead of the uniform Lipschitz parameter\nof the loss, allowing for significantly faster rates in the presence of\noutliers and/or heavy-tailed data. For convex and strongly convex loss\nfunctions, we provide the first asymptotically optimal excess risk bounds (up\nto a logarithmic factor). In contrast to (Wang et al., 2020; Kamath et al.,\n2022), our bounds do not require the loss function to be differentiable/smooth.\nWe also devise a linear-time algorithm for smooth losses that has excess risk\nthat is tight in certain practical parameter regimes. Additionally, our work is\nthe first to address non-convex non-uniformly Lipschitz loss functions\nsatisfying the Proximal-PL inequality; this covers some practical machine\nlearning models.

Existing MIPL approach follows the\ninstance-space paradigm by assigning augmented candidate label sets of bags to\neach instance and aggregating bag-level labels from instance-level labels.\nHowever, this scheme may be suboptimal as global bag-level information is\nignored and the predicted labels of bags are sensitive to predictions of\nnegative instances.

DEMIPL\nemploys a disambiguation attention mechanism to aggregate a multi-instance bag\ninto a single vector representation, followed by a momentum-based\ndisambiguation strategy to identify the ground-truth label from the candidate\nlabel set. Furthermore, we introduce a real-world MIPL dataset for colorectal\ncancer classification. Experimental results on benchmark and real-world\ndatasets validate the superiority of DEMIPL against the compared MIPL and\npartial-label learning approaches.",

          "description": "When deploying modern machine learning-enabled robotic systems in high-stakes\napplications, detecting distribution shift is critical. However, most existing\nmethods for detecting distribution shift are not well-suited to robotics\nsettings, where data often arrives in a streaming fashion and may be very\nhigh-dimensional. In this work, we present an online method for detecting\ndistribution shift with guarantees on the false positive rate - i.e., when\nthere is no distribution shift, our system is very unlikely (with probability\n$< \\epsilon$) to falsely issue an alert; any alerts that are issued should\ntherefore be heeded. Our method is specifically designed for efficient\ndetection even with high dimensional data, and it empirically achieves up to\n11x faster detection on realistic robotics settings compared to prior work\nwhile maintaining a low false negative rate in practice (whenever there is a\ndistribution shift in our experiments, our method indeed emits an alert). We\ndemonstrate our approach in both simulation and hardware for a visual servoing\ntask, and show that our method indeed issues an alert before a failure occurs.",

To investigate this problem, we take an experimental approach and\nmake four overarching contributions: We 1) Define a metric called\nself-consistency, derived from variance, which we use as a proxy for measuring\nand reducing arbitrariness; 2) Develop an ensembling algorithm that abstains\nfrom classification when a prediction would be arbitrary; 3) Conduct the\nlargest to-date empirical study of the role of variance (vis-a-vis\nself-consistency and arbitrariness) in fair classification; and, 4) Release a\ntoolkit that makes the US Home Mortgage Disclosure Act (HMDA) datasets easily\nusable for future research. Altogether, our experiments reveal shocking\ninsights about the reliability of conclusions on benchmark datasets. Most\nfairness classification benchmarks are close-to-fair when taking into account\nthe amount of arbitrariness present in predictions -- before we even try to\napply common fairness interventions.

Over the last years,\nsome reasons behind its superior functioning have been uncovered and further\noptimizations have been explored. However, there is currently no implementation\nthat supports its direct utilization in scenarios involving soft labels. Hence,\na synergy between the use of SDL and research leveraging the use of soft\nlabels, also in the context of model calibration, is still missing. In this\nwork, we introduce Dice semimetric losses (DMLs), which (i) are by design\nidentical to SDL in a standard setting with hard labels, but (ii) can be\nemployed in settings with soft labels. Our experiments on the public QUBIQ,\nLiTS and KiTS benchmarks confirm the potential synergy of DMLs with soft labels\n(e.g.\\ averaging, label smoothing, and knowledge distillation) over hard labels\n(e.g.\\ majority voting and random selection). As a result, we obtain superior\nDice scores and model calibration, which supports the wider adoption of DMLs in\npractice.

          "description": "Existing approaches defend against backdoor attacks in federated learning\n(FL) mainly through a) mitigating the impact of infected models, or b)\nexcluding infected models. The former negatively impacts model accuracy, while\nthe latter usually relies on globally clear boundaries between benign and\ninfected model updates. However, model updates are easy to be mixed and\nscattered throughout in reality due to the diverse distributions of local data.\nThis work focuses on excluding infected models in FL. Unlike previous\nperspectives from a global view, we propose Snowball, a novel anti-backdoor FL\nframework through bidirectional elections from an individual perspective\ninspired by one principle deduced by us and two principles in FL and deep\nlearning. It is characterized by a) bottom-up election, where each candidate\nmodel update votes to several peer ones such that a few model updates are\nelected as selectees for aggregation; and b) top-down election, where selectees\nprogressively enlarge themselves through picking up from the candidates. We\ncompare Snowball with state-of-the-art defenses to backdoor attacks in FL on\nfive real-world datasets, demonstrating its superior resistance to backdoor\nattacks and slight impact on the accuracy of the global model.",

          "description": "Parallelization techniques have become ubiquitous for accelerating inference\nand training of deep neural networks. Despite this, several operations are\nstill performed in a sequential manner. For instance, the forward and backward\npasses are executed layer-by-layer, and the output of diffusion models is\nproduced by applying a sequence of denoising steps. This sequential approach\nresults in a computational cost proportional to the number of steps involved,\npresenting a potential bottleneck as the number of steps increases. In this\nwork, we introduce DeepPCR, a novel algorithm which parallelizes typically\nsequential operations used in inference and training of neural networks.\nDeepPCR is based on interpreting a sequence of $L$ steps as the solution of a\nspecific system of equations, which we recover using the Parallel Cyclic\nReduction algorithm. This reduces the complexity of computing the sequential\noperations from $\\mathcal{O}(L)$ to $\\mathcal{O}(\\log_2L)$, thus yielding a\nspeedup for large $L$. To verify the theoretical lower complexity of the\nalgorithm, and to identify regimes for speedup, we test the effectiveness of\nDeepPCR in parallelizing the forward and backward pass in multi-layer\nperceptrons, and reach speedups of up to $30\\times$ for forward and $200\\times$\nfor backward pass. We additionally showcase the flexibility of DeepPCR by\nparallelizing training of ResNets with as many as 1024 layers, and generation\nin diffusion models, enabling up to $7\\times$ faster training and $11\\times$\nfaster generation, respectively, when compared to the sequential approach.",

          "description": "We investigate the regret-minimisation problem in a multi-armed bandit\nsetting with arbitrary corruptions. Similar to the classical setup, the agent\nreceives rewards generated independently from the distribution of the arm\nchosen at each time. However, these rewards are not directly observed. Instead,\nwith a fixed $\\varepsilon\\in (0,\\frac{1}{2})$, the agent observes a sample from\nthe chosen arm's distribution with probability $1-\\varepsilon$, or from an\narbitrary corruption distribution with probability $\\varepsilon$. Importantly,\nwe impose no assumptions on these corruption distributions, which can be\nunbounded. In this setting, accommodating potentially unbounded corruptions, we\nestablish a problem-dependent lower bound on regret for a given family of arm\ndistributions. We introduce CRIMED, an asymptotically-optimal algorithm that\nachieves the exact lower bound on regret for bandits with Gaussian\ndistributions with known variance. Additionally, we provide a finite-sample\nanalysis of CRIMED's regret performance. Notably, CRIMED can effectively handle\ncorruptions with $\\varepsilon$ values as high as $\\frac{1}{2}$. Furthermore, we\ndevelop a tight concentration result for medians in the presence of arbitrary\ncorruptions, even with $\\varepsilon$ values up to $\\frac{1}{2}$, which may be\nof independent interest. We also discuss an extension of the algorithm for\nhandling misspecification in Gaussian model.",

In E2Net, we propose Representative\nNetwork Distillation to identify the representative core subnet by assessing\nparameter quantity and output similarity with the working network, distilling\nanalogous subnets within the working network to mitigate reliance on rehearsal\nbuffers and facilitating knowledge transfer across previous tasks. To enhance\nstorage resource utilization, we then propose Subnet Constraint Experience\nReplay to optimize rehearsal efficiency through a sample storage strategy based\non the structures of representative networks.

          "description": "Women are at higher risk of Alzheimer's and other neurological diseases after\nmenopause, and yet research connecting female brain health to sex hormone\nfluctuations is limited. We seek to investigate this connection by developing\ntools that quantify 3D shape changes that occur in the brain during sex hormone\nfluctuations. Geodesic regression on the space of 3D discrete surfaces offers a\nprincipled way to characterize the evolution of a brain's shape. However, in\nits current form, this approach is too computationally expensive for practical\nuse. In this paper, we propose approximation schemes that accelerate geodesic\nregression on shape spaces of 3D discrete surfaces. We also provide rules of\nthumb for when each approximation can be used. We test our approach on\nsynthetic data to quantify the speed-accuracy trade-off of these approximations\nand show that practitioners can expect very significant speed-up while only\nsacrificing little accuracy. Finally, we apply the method to real brain shape\ndata and produce the first characterization of how the female hippocampus\nchanges shape during the menstrual cycle as a function of progesterone: a\ncharacterization made (practically) possible by our approximation schemes.

          "description": "Vision Transformer (ViT) has emerged as a powerful architecture in the realm\nof modern computer vision. However, its application in certain imaging fields,\nsuch as microscopy and satellite imaging, presents unique challenges. In these\ndomains, images often contain multiple channels, each carrying semantically\ndistinct and independent information. Furthermore, the model must demonstrate\nrobustness to sparsity in input channels, as they may not be densely available\nduring training or testing. In this paper, we propose a modification to the ViT\narchitecture that enhances reasoning across the input channels and introduce\nHierarchical Channel Sampling (HCS) as an additional regularization technique\nto ensure robustness when only partial channels are presented during test time.\nOur proposed model, ChannelViT, constructs patch tokens independently from each\ninput channel and utilizes a learnable channel embedding that is added to the\npatch tokens, similar to positional embeddings. We evaluate the performance of\nChannelViT on ImageNet, JUMP-CP (microscopy cell imaging), and So2Sat\n(satellite imaging). Our results show that ChannelViT outperforms ViT on\nclassification tasks and generalizes well, even when a subset of input channels\nis used during testing. Across our experiments, HCS proves to be a powerful\nregularizer, independent of the architecture employed, suggesting itself as a\nstraightforward technique for robust ViT training. Lastly, we find that\nChannelViT generalizes effectively even when there is limited access to all\nchannels during training, highlighting its potential for multi-channel imaging\nunder real-world conditions with sparse sensors.",

          "description": "Quantifying the dependence between high-dimensional random variables is\ncentral to statistical learning and inference. Two classical methods are\ncanonical correlation analysis (CCA), which identifies maximally correlated\nprojected versions of the original variables, and Shannon's mutual information,\nwhich is a universal dependence measure that also captures high-order\ndependencies. However, CCA only accounts for linear dependence, which may be\ninsufficient for certain applications, while mutual information is often\ninfeasible to compute/estimate in high dimensions. This work proposes a middle\nground in the form of a scalable information-theoretic generalization of CCA,\ntermed max-sliced mutual information (mSMI). mSMI equals the maximal mutual\ninformation between low-dimensional projections of the high-dimensional\nvariables, which reduces back to CCA in the Gaussian case. It enjoys the best\nof both worlds: capturing intricate dependencies in the data while being\namenable to fast computation and scalable estimation from samples. We show that\nmSMI retains favorable structural properties of Shannon's mutual information,\nlike variational forms and identification of independence. We then study\nstatistical estimation of mSMI, propose an efficiently computable neural\nestimator, and couple it with formal non-asymptotic error bounds. We present\nexperiments that demonstrate the utility of mSMI for several tasks,\nencompassing independence testing, multi-view representation learning,\nalgorithmic fairness, and generative modeling.

          "description": "Modern streaming data categorization faces significant challenges from\nconcept drift and class imbalanced data. This negatively impacts the output of\nthe classifier, leading to improper classification. Furthermore, other factors\nsuch as the overlapping of multiple classes limit the extent of the correctness\nof the output. This work proposes a novel framework for integrating data\npre-processing and dynamic ensemble selection, by formulating the\nclassification framework for the nonstationary drifting imbalanced data stream,\nwhich employs the data pre-processing and dynamic ensemble selection\ntechniques. The proposed framework was evaluated using six artificially\ngenerated data streams with differing imbalance ratios in combination with two\ndifferent types of concept drifts. Each stream is composed of 200 chunks of 500\nobjects described by eight features and contains five concept drifts. Seven\npre-processing techniques and two dynamic ensemble selection methods were\nconsidered. According to experimental results, data pre-processing combined\nwith Dynamic Ensemble Selection techniques significantly delivers more accuracy\nwhen dealing with imbalanced data streams.",

          "description": "High-quality face images are required to guarantee the stability and\nreliability of automatic face recognition (FR) systems in surveillance and\nsecurity scenarios. However, a massive amount of face data is usually\ncompressed before being analyzed due to limitations on transmission or storage.\nThe compressed images may lose the powerful identity information, resulting in\nthe performance degradation of the FR system. Herein, we make the first attempt\nto study just noticeable difference (JND) for the FR system, which can be\ndefined as the maximum distortion that the FR system cannot notice. More\nspecifically, we establish a JND dataset including 3530 original images and\n137,670 compressed images generated by advanced reference encoding/decoding\nsoftware based on the Versatile Video Coding (VVC) standard (VTM-15.0).\nSubsequently, we develop a novel JND prediction model to directly infer JND\nimages for the FR system. In particular, in order to maximum redundancy removal\nwithout impairment of robust identity information, we apply the encoder with\nmultiple feature extraction and attention-based feature decomposition modules\nto progressively decompose face features into two uncorrelated components,\ni.e., identity and residual features, via self-supervised learning. Then, the\nresidual feature is fed into the decoder to generate the residual map. Finally,\nthe predicted JND map is obtained by subtracting the residual map from the\noriginal image. Experimental results have demonstrated that the proposed model\nachieves higher accuracy of JND map prediction compared with the\nstate-of-the-art JND models, and is capable of saving more bits while\nmaintaining the performance of the FR system compared with VTM-15.0.",

In\nprevious studies, QCNNs attained a higher classification accuracy than their\nclassical counterparts under the same training conditions in the few-parameter\nregime.

We perform numerical simulations of QCNN models with\nvarious sets of quantum convolution and pooling operations for MNIST data\nclassification under transfer learning, in which a classical CNN is trained\nwith Fashion-MNIST data. The results show that transfer learning from classical\nto quantum CNN performs considerably better than purely classical transfer\nlearning models under similar training conditions.",

          "description": "Autonomous systems (AS) often use Deep Neural Network (DNN) classifiers to\nallow them to operate in complex, high-dimensional, non-linear, and dynamically\nchanging environments. Due to the complexity of these environments, DNN\nclassifiers may output misclassifications during operation when they face\ndomains not identified during development. Removing a system from operation for\nretraining becomes impractical as the number of such AS increases. To increase\nAS reliability and overcome this limitation, DNN classifiers need to have the\nability to adapt during operation when faced with different operational domains\nusing a few samples (e.g. 100 samples). However, retraining DNNs on a few\nsamples is known to cause catastrophic forgetting. In this paper, we introduce\nDynamic Incremental Regularised Adaptation (DIRA), a framework for operational\ndomain adaption of DNN classifiers using regularisation techniques to overcome\ncatastrophic forgetting and achieve adaptation when retraining using a few\nsamples of the target domain. Our approach shows improvements on different\nimage classification benchmarks aimed at evaluating robustness to distribution\nshifts (e.g.CIFAR-10C/100C, ImageNet-C), and produces state-of-the-art\nperformance in comparison with other frameworks from the literature.",

However, the node representation update is too slow, resulting in\neither long response latency of user queries (the inference is performed after\nthe update completes) or high staleness problem (the inference is performed\nbased on stale data). Our in-depth analysis shows that the slow update is\nmainly due to neighbor explosion problem in graphs and duplicated computation.\nBased on such findings, we propose STAG, a GNN serving framework that enables\nlow latency and low staleness of GNN-based services. It comprises a\ncollaborative serving mechanism and an additivity-based incremental propagation\nstrategy. With the collaborative serving mechanism, only part of node\nrepresentations are updated during the update phase, and the final\nrepresentations are calculated in the inference phase. It alleviates the\nneighbor explosion problem. The additivity-based incremental propagation\nstrategy reuses intermediate data during the update phase, eliminating\nduplicated computation problem.

          "description": "Exact computation of the partition function is known to be intractable,\nnecessitating approximate inference techniques. Existing methods for\napproximate inference are slow to converge for many benchmarks. The control of\naccuracy-complexity trade-off is also non-trivial in many of these methods. We\npropose a novel incremental build-infer-approximate (IBIA) framework for\napproximate inference that addresses these issues. In this framework, the\nprobabilistic graphical model is converted into a sequence of clique tree\nforests (SCTF) with bounded clique sizes. We show that the SCTF can be used to\nefficiently compute the partition function. We propose two new algorithms which\nare used to construct the SCTF and prove the correctness of both. The first is\nan algorithm for incremental construction of CTFs that is guaranteed to give a\nvalid CTF with bounded clique sizes and the second is an approximation\nalgorithm that takes a calibrated CTF as input and yields a valid and\ncalibrated CTF with reduced clique sizes as the output. We have evaluated our\nmethod using several benchmark sets from recent UAI competitions and our\nresults show good accuracies with competitive runtimes.",

          "description": "A fundamental shortcoming of the concept of Nash equilibrium is its\ncomputational intractability: approximating Nash equilibria in normal-form\ngames is PPAD-hard. In this paper, inspired by the ideas of smoothed analysis,\nwe introduce a relaxed variant of Nash equilibrium called $\\sigma$-smooth Nash\nequilibrium, for a smoothness parameter $\\sigma$. In a $\\sigma$-smooth Nash\nequilibrium, players only need to achieve utility at least as high as their\nbest deviation to a $\\sigma$-smooth strategy, which is a distribution that does\nnot put too much mass (as parametrized by $\\sigma$) on any fixed action. We\ndistinguish two variants of $\\sigma$-smooth Nash equilibria: strong\n$\\sigma$-smooth Nash equilibria, in which players are required to play\n$\\sigma$-smooth strategies under equilibrium play, and weak $\\sigma$-smooth\nNash equilibria, where there is no such requirement.\n\nWe show that both weak and strong $\\sigma$-smooth Nash equilibria have\nsuperior computational properties to Nash equilibria: when $\\sigma$ as well as\nan approximation parameter $\\epsilon$ and the number of players are all\nconstants, there is a constant-time randomized algorithm to find a weak\n$\\epsilon$-approximate $\\sigma$-smooth Nash equilibrium in normal-form games.\nIn the same parameter regime, there is a polynomial-time deterministic\nalgorithm to find a strong $\\epsilon$-approximate $\\sigma$-smooth Nash\nequilibrium in a normal-form game. These results stand in contrast to the\noptimal algorithm for computing $\\epsilon$-approximate Nash equilibria, which\ncannot run in faster than quasipolynomial-time. We complement our upper bounds\nby showing that when either $\\sigma$ or $\\epsilon$ is an inverse polynomial,\nfinding a weak $\\epsilon$-approximate $\\sigma$-smooth Nash equilibria becomes\ncomputationally intractable.",

          "description": "Denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs) have shown promising\nperformance for speech synthesis. However, a large number of iterative steps\nare required to achieve high sample quality, which restricts the inference\nspeed. Maintaining sample quality while increasing sampling speed has become a\nchallenging task. In this paper, we propose a \"Co\"nsistency \"Mo\"del-based\n\"Speech\" synthesis method, CoMoSpeech, which achieve speech synthesis through a\nsingle diffusion sampling step while achieving high audio quality. The\nconsistency constraint is applied to distill a consistency model from a\nwell-designed diffusion-based teacher model, which ultimately yields superior\nperformances in the distilled CoMoSpeech. Our experiments show that by\ngenerating audio recordings by a single sampling step, the CoMoSpeech achieves\nan inference speed more than 150 times faster than real-time on a single NVIDIA\nA100 GPU, which is comparable to FastSpeech2, making diffusion-sampling based\nspeech synthesis truly practical. Meanwhile, objective and subjective\nevaluations on text-to-speech and singing voice synthesis show that the\nproposed teacher models yield the best audio quality, and the one-step sampling\nbased CoMoSpeech achieves the best inference speed with better or comparable\naudio quality to other conventional multi-step diffusion model baselines.

Leveraging Natural\nLanguage Processing (NLP) on radiology reports, automated methods have shown\npromising advancements in identifying VTE events from retrospective data\ncohorts or aiding clinical experts in identifying VTE events from radiology\nreports. However, effectively training Deep Learning (DL) and the NLP models is\nchallenging due to limited labeled medical text data, the complexity and\nheterogeneity of radiology reports, and data imbalance. This study proposes\nnovel method combinations of DL methods, along with data augmentation, adaptive\npre-trained NLP model selection, and a clinical expert NLP rule-based\nclassifier, to improve the accuracy of VTE identification in unstructured\n(free-text) radiology reports. Our experimental results demonstrate the model's\nefficacy, achieving an impressive 97\\% accuracy and 97\\% F1 score in predicting\nDVT, and an outstanding 98.3\\% accuracy and 98.4\\% F1 score in predicting PE.\nThese findings emphasize the model's robustness and its potential to\nsignificantly contribute to VTE research.",

          "description": "Conditional GANs are frequently used for manipulating the attributes of face\nimages, such as expression, hairstyle, pose, or age. Even though the\nstate-of-the-art models successfully modify the requested attributes, they\nsimultaneously modify other important characteristics of the image, such as a\nperson's identity. In this paper, we focus on solving this problem by\nintroducing PluGeN4Faces, a plugin to StyleGAN, which explicitly disentangles\nface attributes from a person's identity. Our key idea is to perform training\non images retrieved from movie frames, where a given person appears in various\nposes and with different attributes. By applying a type of contrastive loss, we\nencourage the model to group images of the same person in similar regions of\nlatent space. Our experiments demonstrate that the modifications of face\nattributes performed by PluGeN4Faces are significantly less invasive on the\nremaining characteristics of the image than in the existing state-of-the-art\nmodels.",

          "description": "We consider probabilistic models for sequential observations which exhibit\ngradual transitions among a finite number of states. We are particularly\nmotivated by applications such as human activity analysis where observed\naccelerometer time series contains segments representing distinct activities,\nwhich we call pure states, as well as periods characterized by continuous\ntransition among these pure states. To capture this transitory behavior, the\ndynamical Wasserstein barycenter (DWB) model of Cheng et al. in 2021 [1]\nassociates with each pure state a data-generating distribution and models the\ncontinuous transitions among these states as a Wasserstein barycenter of these\ndistributions with dynamically evolving weights. Focusing on the univariate\ncase where Wasserstein distances and barycenters can be computed in closed\nform, we extend [1] specifically relaxing the parameterization of the pure\nstates as Gaussian distributions. We highlight issues related to the uniqueness\nin identifying the model parameters as well as uncertainties induced when\nestimating a dynamically evolving distribution from a limited number of\nsamples. To ameliorate non-uniqueness, we introduce regularization that imposes\ntemporal smoothness on the dynamics of the barycentric weights. A\nquantile-based approximation of the pure state distributions yields a finite\ndimensional estimation problem which we numerically solve using cyclic descent\nalternating between updates to the pure-state quantile functions and the\nbarycentric weights. We demonstrate the utility of the proposed algorithm in\nsegmenting both simulated and real world human activity time series.",

          "description": "This work introduces Physics-informed State-space neural network Models\n(PSMs), a novel solution to achieving real-time optimization, flexibility, and\nfault tolerance in autonomous systems, particularly in transport-dominated\nsystems such as chemical, biomedical, and power plants. Traditional data-driven\nmethods fall short due to a lack of physical constraints like mass\nconservation; PSMs address this issue by training deep neural networks with\nsensor data and physics-informing using components' Partial Differential\nEquations (PDEs), resulting in a physics-constrained, end-to-end differentiable\nforward dynamics model. Through two in silico experiments - a heated channel\nand a cooling system loop - we demonstrate that PSMs offer a more accurate\napproach than purely data-driven models.\n\nBeyond accuracy, there are several compelling use cases for PSMs. In this\nwork, we showcase two: the creation of a nonlinear supervisory controller\nthrough a sequentially updated state-space representation and the proposal of a\ndiagnostic algorithm using residuals from each of the PDEs. The former\ndemonstrates the ability of PSMs to handle both constant and time-dependent\nconstraints, while the latter illustrates their value in system diagnostics and\nfault detection. We further posit that PSMs could serve as a foundation for\nDigital Twins, constantly updated digital representations of physical systems.",

          "description": "This study introduces a novel hierarchical divisive clustering approach with\nstochastic splitting functions (SSFs) to enhance classification performance in\nmulti-class datasets through hierarchical classification (HC). The method has\nthe unique capability of generating hierarchy without requiring explicit\ninformation, making it suitable for datasets lacking prior knowledge of\nhierarchy. By systematically dividing classes into two subsets based on their\ndiscriminability according to the classifier, the proposed approach constructs\na binary tree representation of hierarchical classes. The approach is evaluated\non 46 multi-class time series datasets using popular classifiers (svm and\nrocket) and SSFs (potr, srtr, and lsoo). The results reveal that the approach\nsignificantly improves classification performance in approximately half and a\nthird of the datasets when using rocket and svm as the classifier,\nrespectively. The study also explores the relationship between dataset features\nand HC performance. While the number of classes and flat classification (FC)\nscore show consistent significance, variations are observed with different\nsplitting functions. Overall, the proposed approach presents a promising\nstrategy for enhancing classification by generating hierarchical structure in\nmulti-class time series datasets. Future research directions involve exploring\ndifferent splitting functions, classifiers, and hierarchy structures, as well\nas applying the approach to diverse domains beyond time series data.

          "description": "Session-based recommendation, aiming at making the prediction of the user's\nnext item click based on the information in a single session only even in the\npresence of some random user's behavior, is a complex problem.

In this paper,\nwe discover the existing critical issue of the low-capability predictor module\namong existing models.

          "description": "Analyzing high resolution whole slide images (WSIs) with regard to\ninformation across multiple scales poses a significant challenge in digital\npathology. Multi-instance learning (MIL) is a common solution for working with\nhigh resolution images by classifying bags of objects (i.e. sets of smaller\nimage patches). However, such processing is typically performed at a single\nscale (e.g., 20x magnification) of WSIs, disregarding the vital inter-scale\ninformation that is key to diagnoses by human pathologists. In this study, we\npropose a novel cross-scale MIL algorithm to explicitly aggregate inter-scale\nrelationships into a single MIL network for pathological image diagnosis. The\ncontribution of this paper is three-fold: (1) A novel cross-scale MIL (CS-MIL)\nalgorithm that integrates the multi-scale information and the inter-scale\nrelationships is proposed; (2) A toy dataset with scale-specific morphological\nfeatures is created and released to examine and visualize differential\ncross-scale attention; (3) Superior performance on both in-house and public\ndatasets is demonstrated by our simple cross-scale MIL strategy. The official\nimplementation is publicly available at https://github.com/hrlblab/CS-MIL.",

          "description": "Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), a widely used optimization algorithm in\ndeep learning, is often limited to converging to local optima due to the\nnon-convex nature of the problem. Leveraging these local optima to improve\nmodel performance remains a challenging task. Given the inherent complexity of\nneural networks, the simple arithmetic averaging of the obtained local optima\nmodels in undesirable results. This paper proposes a {\\em soft merging} method\nthat facilitates rapid merging of multiple models, simplifies the merging of\nspecific parts of neural networks, and enhances robustness against malicious\nmodels with extreme values. This is achieved by learning gate parameters\nthrough a surrogate of the $l_0$ norm using hard concrete distribution without\nmodifying the model weights of the given local optima models. This merging\nprocess not only enhances the model performance by converging to a better local\noptimum, but also minimizes computational costs, offering an efficient and\nexplicit learning process integrated with stochastic gradient descent. Thorough\nexperiments underscore the effectiveness and superior performance of the merged\nneural networks.",

          "description": "Biomedical image datasets can be imbalanced due to the rarity of targeted\ndiseases. Generative Adversarial Networks play a key role in addressing this\nimbalance by enabling the generation of synthetic images to augment datasets.\nIt is important to generate synthetic images that incorporate a diverse range\nof features to accurately represent the distribution of features present in the\ntraining imagery. Furthermore, the absence of diverse features in synthetic\nimages can degrade the performance of machine learning classifiers. The mode\ncollapse problem impacts Generative Adversarial Networks' capacity to generate\ndiversified images. Mode collapse comes in two varieties: intra-class and\ninter-class. In this paper, both varieties of the mode collapse problem are\ninvestigated, and their subsequent impact on the diversity of synthetic X-ray\nimages is evaluated. This work contributes an empirical demonstration of the\nbenefits of integrating the adaptive input-image normalization with the Deep\nConvolutional GAN and Auxiliary Classifier GAN to alleviate the mode collapse\nproblems. Synthetically generated images are utilized for data augmentation and\ntraining a Vision Transformer model. The classification performance of the\nmodel is evaluated using accuracy, recall, and precision scores. Results\ndemonstrate that the DCGAN and the ACGAN with adaptive input-image\nnormalization outperform the DCGAN and ACGAN with un-normalized X-ray images as\nevidenced by the superior diversity scores and classification scores.",

          "description": "This paper presents our solution for the Real Robot Challenge (RRC) III, a\ncompetition featured in the NeurIPS 2022 Competition Track, aimed at addressing\ndexterous robotic manipulation tasks through learning from pre-collected\noffline data. Participants were provided with two types of datasets for each\ntask: expert and mixed datasets with varying skill levels. While the simplest\noffline policy learning algorithm, Behavioral Cloning (BC), performed\nremarkably well when trained on expert datasets, it outperformed even the most\nadvanced offline reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms. However, BC's\nperformance deteriorated when applied to mixed datasets, and the performance of\noffline RL algorithms was also unsatisfactory. Upon examining the mixed\ndatasets, we observed that they contained a significant amount of expert data,\nalthough this data was unlabeled. To address this issue, we proposed a\nsemi-supervised learning-based classifier to identify the underlying expert\nbehavior within mixed datasets, effectively isolating the expert data. To\nfurther enhance BC's performance, we leveraged the geometric symmetry of the\nRRC arena to augment the training dataset through mathematical transformations.\nIn the end, our submission surpassed that of all other participants, even those\nwho employed complex offline RL algorithms and intricate data processing and\nfeature engineering techniques.",

          "description": "Numerically solving partial differential equations typically requires fine\ndiscretization to resolve necessary spatiotemporal scales, which can be\ncomputationally expensive. Recent advances in deep learning have provided a new\napproach to solving partial differential equations that involves the use of\nneural operators. Neural operators are neural network architectures that learn\nmappings between function spaces and have the capability to solve partial\ndifferential equations based on data. This study utilizes a novel neural\noperator called Hyena, which employs a long convolutional filter that is\nparameterized by a multilayer perceptron. The Hyena operator is an operation\nthat enjoys sub-quadratic complexity and state space model to parameterize long\nconvolution that enjoys a global receptive field. This mechanism enhances the\nmodel's comprehension of the input's context and enables data-dependent weight\nfor different partial differential equations instances. To measure how\neffective the layers are in solving partial differential equations, we conduct\nexperiments on Diffusion-Reaction equation and Navier Stokes equation. Our\nfindings indicate Hyena Neural operator can serve as an efficient and accurate\nmodel for learning partial differential equations solution operator.

However, adversaries can still infer\nindividual information through inference attacks (e.g. differential attacks) on\nthese training parameters. As a result, Differential Privacy (DP) has been\nwidely used in FL to prevent such attacks. We consider differentially private\nfederated learning in a resource-constrained scenario, where both privacy\nbudget and communication round are constrained. By theoretically analyzing the\nconvergence, we can find the optimal number of differentially private local\niterations for clients between any two sequential global updates. Based on\nthis, we design an algorithm of differentially private federated learning with\nadaptive local iterations (ALI-DPFL).

          "description": "Learning control policies offline from pre-recorded datasets is a promising\navenue for solving challenging real-world problems. However, available datasets\nare typically of mixed quality, with a limited number of the trajectories that\nwe would consider as positive examples; i.e., high-quality demonstrations.\nTherefore, we propose a novel iterative learning algorithm for identifying\nexpert trajectories in unlabeled mixed-quality robotics datasets given a\nminimal set of positive examples, surpassing existing algorithms in terms of\naccuracy. We show that applying behavioral cloning to the resulting filtered\ndataset outperforms several competitive offline reinforcement learning and\nimitation learning baselines. We perform experiments on a range of simulated\nlocomotion tasks and on two challenging manipulation tasks on a real robotic\nsystem; in these experiments, our method showcases state-of-the-art\nperformance.

          "description": "Connectionist temporal classification (CTC) is commonly adopted for sequence\nmodeling tasks like speech recognition, where it is necessary to preserve order\nbetween the input and target sequences. However, CTC is only applied to\ndeterministic sequence models, where the latent space is discontinuous and\nsparse, which in turn makes them less capable of handling data variability when\ncompared to variational models. In this paper, we integrate CTC with a\nvariational model and derive loss functions that can be used to train more\ngeneralizable sequence models that preserve order. Specifically, we derive two\nversions of the novel variational CTC based on two reasonable assumptions, the\nfirst being that the variational latent variables at each time step are\nconditionally independent; and the second being that these latent variables are\nMarkovian. We show that both loss functions allow direct optimization of the\nvariational lower bound for the model log-likelihood, and present\ncomputationally tractable forms for implementing them.",

          "description": "The ability to classify images is dependent on having access to large labeled\ndatasets and testing on data from the same domain that the model can train on.\nClassification becomes more challenging when dealing with new data from a\ndifferent domain, where gathering and especially labeling a larger image\ndataset for retraining a classification model requires a labor-intensive human\neffort. Cross-domain classification frameworks were developed to handle this\ndata domain shift problem by utilizing unsupervised image-to-image translation\nmodels to translate an input image from the unlabeled domain to the labeled\ndomain. The problem with these unsupervised models lies in their unsupervised\nnature. For lack of annotations, it is not possible to use the traditional\nsupervised metrics to evaluate these translation models to pick the best-saved\ncheckpoint model. This paper introduces a new method called Domain-knowledge\nInspired Pseudo Supervision (DIPS) which utilizes domain-informed Gaussian\nMixture Models to generate pseudo annotations to enable the use of traditional\nsupervised metrics. This method was designed specifically to support\ncross-domain classification applications contrary to other typically used\nmetrics such as the FID which were designed to evaluate the model in terms of\nthe quality of the generated image from a human-eye perspective. DIPS proves\nits effectiveness by outperforming various GAN evaluation metrics, including\nFID, when selecting the optimal saved checkpoint model. It is also evaluated\nagainst truly supervised metrics. Furthermore, DIPS showcases its robustness\nand interpretability by demonstrating a strong correlation with truly\nsupervised metrics, highlighting its superiority over existing state-of-the-art\nalternatives.

          "description": "Emerging real-time multi-model ML (RTMM) workloads such as AR/VR and drone\ncontrol involve dynamic behaviors in various granularity; task, model, and\nlayers within a model. Such dynamic behaviors introduce new challenges to the\nsystem software in an ML system since the overall system load is not completely\npredictable, unlike traditional ML workloads. In addition, RTMM workloads\nrequire real-time processing, involve highly heterogeneous models, and target\nresource-constrained devices. Under such circumstances, developing an effective\nscheduler gains more importance to better utilize underlying hardware\nconsidering the unique characteristics of RTMM workloads. Therefore, we propose\na new scheduler, DREAM, which effectively handles various dynamicity in RTMM\nworkloads targeting multi-accelerator systems. DREAM quantifies the unique\nrequirements for RTMM workloads and utilizes the quantified scores to drive\nscheduling decisions, considering the current system load and other inference\njobs on different models and input frames. DREAM utilizes tunable parameters\nthat provide fast and effective adaptivity to dynamic workload changes. In our\nevaluation of five scenarios of RTMM workload, DREAM reduces the overall\nUXCost, which is an equivalent metric of the energy-delay product (EDP) for\nRTMM defined in the paper, by 32.2% and 50.0% in the geometric mean (up to\n80.8% and 97.6%) compared to state-of-the-art baselines, which shows the\nefficacy of our scheduling methodology.",

Diffractive optical networks provide a promising solution for\nimplementing artificial intelligence with high-speed and low-power consumption.\nMost of the reported diffractive optical networks focus on single or multiple\ntasks that do not involve environmental interaction, such as object recognition\nand image classification. In contrast, the networks capable of performing\ndecision-making and control have not yet been developed to our knowledge. Here,\nwe propose using deep reinforcement learning to implement diffractive optical\nnetworks that imitate human-level decision-making and control capability. Such\nnetworks taking advantage of a residual architecture, allow for finding optimal\ncontrol policies through interaction with the environment and can be readily\nimplemented with existing optical devices. The superior performance of these\nnetworks is verified by engaging three types of classic games, Tic-Tac-Toe,\nSuper Mario Bros., and Car Racing. Finally, we present an experimental\ndemonstration of playing Tic-Tac-Toe by leveraging diffractive optical networks\nbased on a spatial light modulator.

A natural problem then is to\nanalyse and compare the (not necessarily hierarchical) sequences of partitions\nthat underpin such multiscale descriptions of data. Here, we introduce a\nfiltration of abstract simplicial complexes, denoted the Multiscale Clustering\nFiltration (MCF), which encodes arbitrary patterns of cluster assignments\nacross scales, and we prove that the MCF produces stable persistence diagrams.\nWe then show that the zero-dimensional persistent homology of the MCF measures\nthe degree of hierarchy in the sequence of partitions, and that the\nhigher-dimensional persistent homology tracks the emergence and resolution of\nconflicts between cluster assignments across the sequence of partitions. To\nbroaden the theoretical foundations of the MCF, we also provide an equivalent\nconstruction via a nerve complex filtration, and we show that in the\nhierarchical case, the MCF reduces to a Vietoris-Rips filtration of an\nultrametric space.

Thus,\nwe propose a method that starts with a pretrained embedding and a multi-env\nsetup and manages to rank the features based on their environment-focus. First,\nwe compute a per-feature score based on the feature distribution variance\nbetween envs. Next, we show that by dropping the highly scored ones, we manage\nto remove spurious correlations and improve the overall performance by up to\n6%, both in covariance and sub-population shift cases, both for a real and a\nsynthetic benchmark, that we introduce for this task.",

          "description": "With growing attention to tabular data these days, the attempt to apply a\nsynthetic table to various tasks has been expanded toward various scenarios.\nOwing to the recent advances in generative modeling, fake data generated by\ntabular data synthesis models become sophisticated and realistic. However,\nthere still exists a difficulty in modeling discrete variables (columns) of\ntabular data. In this work, we propose to process continuous and discrete\nvariables separately (but being conditioned on each other) by two diffusion\nmodels. The two diffusion models are co-evolved during training by reading\nconditions from each other. In order to further bind the diffusion models,\nmoreover, we introduce a contrastive learning method with a negative sampling\nmethod.

          "description": "Modern deep networks are trained with stochastic gradient descent (SGD) whose\nkey parameters are the number of data considered at each step or batch size\n$B$, and the step size or learning rate $\\eta$. For small $B$ and large $\\eta$,\nSGD corresponds to a stochastic evolution of the parameters, whose noise\namplitude is governed by the `temperature' $T\\equiv \\eta/B$. Yet this\ndescription is observed to break down for sufficiently large batches $B\\geq\nB^*$, or simplifies to gradient descent (GD) when the temperature is\nsufficiently small. Understanding where these cross-overs take place remains a\ncentral challenge. Here we resolve these questions for a teacher-student\nperceptron classification model, and show empirically that our key predictions\nstill apply to deep networks. Specifically, we obtain a phase diagram in the\n$B$-$\\eta$ plane that separates three dynamical phases: $\\textit{(i)}$ a\nnoise-dominated SGD governed by temperature, $\\textit{(ii)}$ a\nlarge-first-step-dominated SGD and $\\textit{(iii)}$ GD. These different phases\nalso corresponds to different regimes of generalization error. Remarkably, our\nanalysis reveals that the batch size $B^*$ separating regimes $\\textit{(i)}$\nand $\\textit{(ii)}$ scale with the size $P$ of the training set, with an\nexponent that characterizes the hardness of the classification problem.",

          "description": "A variety of different performance metrics are commonly used in the machine\nlearning literature for the evaluation of classification systems. Some of the\nmost common ones for measuring quality of hard decisions are standard and\nbalanced accuracy, standard and balanced error rate, F-beta score, and Matthews\ncorrelation coefficient (MCC). In this document, we review the definition of\nthese and other metrics and compare them with the expected cost (EC), a metric\nintroduced in every statistical learning course but rarely used in the machine\nlearning literature. We show that both the standard and balanced error rates\nare special cases of the EC. Further, we show its relation with F-beta score\nand MCC and argue that EC is superior to these traditional metrics for being\nbased on first principles from statistics, and for being more general,\ninterpretable, and adaptable to any application scenario. The metrics mentioned\nabove measure the quality of hard decisions. Yet, most modern classification\nsystems output continuous scores for the classes which we may want to evaluate\ndirectly. Metrics for measuring the quality of system scores include the area\nunder the ROC curve, equal error rate, cross-entropy, Brier score, and Bayes EC\nor Bayes risk, among others. The last three metrics are special cases of a\nfamily of metrics given by the expected value of proper scoring rules (PSRs).\nWe review the theory behind these metrics, showing that they are a principled\nway to measure the quality of the posterior probabilities produced by a system.\nFinally, we show how to use these metrics to compute a system's calibration\nloss and compare this metric with the widely-used expected calibration error\n(ECE), arguing that calibration loss based on PSRs is superior to the ECE for\nbeing more interpretable, more general, and directly applicable to the\nmulti-class case, among other reasons.",

The central challenge is the\nsubstantial learning gap between seen and novel categories, as the model learns\nthe former faster due to accurate supervisory information. To address this, we\nintroduce 1) an adaptive margin loss based on estimated class distribution,\nwhich encourages a large negative margin for samples in seen classes, to\nsynchronize learning paces, and 2) pseudo-label contrastive clustering, which\npulls together samples which are likely from the same class in the output\nspace, to enhance novel class discovery. Our extensive evaluations on multiple\ndatasets demonstrate that existing models still hinder novel class learning,\nwhereas our approach strikingly balances both seen and novel classes, achieving\na remarkable 3% average accuracy increase on the ImageNet dataset compared to\nthe prior state-of-the-art.

This paper introduces two\ndeterministic approximation algorithms for the problem that competitively\nimprove the query complexity of existing algorithms.\n\nOur first algorithm, $\\LAA$, returns an approximation ratio of $1/19$ within\n$O(nk)$ query complexity. The second one, $\\RLA$, improves the approximation\nratio to $1/5-\\epsilon$ in $O(nk)$ queries, where $\\epsilon$ is an input\nparameter.\n\nOur algorithms are the first ones that provide constant approximation ratios\nwithin only $O(nk)$ query complexity for the non-monotone objective. They,\ntherefore, need fewer the number of queries than state-of-the-the-art ones by a\nfactor of $\\Omega(\\log n)$.\n\nBesides the theoretical analysis, we have evaluated our proposed ones with\nseveral experiments in some instances: Influence Maximization and Sensor\nPlacement for the problem.

          "description": "Disease progression simulation is a crucial area of research that has\nsignificant implications for clinical diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment. One\nmajor challenge in this field is the lack of continuous medical imaging\nmonitoring of individual patients over time. To address this issue, we develop\na novel framework termed Progressive Image Editing (PIE) that enables\ncontrolled manipulation of disease-related image features, facilitating precise\nand realistic disease progression simulation. Specifically, we leverage recent\nadvancements in text-to-image generative models to simulate disease progression\naccurately and personalize it for each patient. We theoretically analyze the\niterative refining process in our framework as a gradient descent with an\nexponentially decayed learning rate. To validate our framework, we conduct\nexperiments in three medical imaging domains. Our results demonstrate the\nsuperiority of PIE over existing methods such as Stable Diffusion Walk and\nStyle-Based Manifold Extrapolation based on CLIP score (Realism) and Disease\nClassification Confidence (Alignment). Our user study collected feedback from\n35 veteran physicians to assess the generated progressions. Remarkably, 76.2%\nof the feedback agrees with the fidelity of the generated progressions. To our\nbest knowledge, PIE is the first of its kind to generate disease progression\nimages meeting real-world standards.

In this paper, we propose SupeRBNN, an AQFP-based randomized BNN\nacceleration framework that leverages software-hardware co-optimization to\neventually make the AQFP devices a feasible solution for BNN acceleration.\nSpecifically, we investigate the randomized behavior of the AQFP devices and\nanalyze the impact of crossbar size on current attenuation, subsequently\nformulating the current amplitude into the values suitable for use in BNN\ncomputation. To tackle the accumulation problem and improve overall hardware\nperformance, we propose a stochastic computing-based accumulation module and a\nclocking scheme adjustment-based circuit optimization method. We validate our\nSupeRBNN framework across various datasets and network architectures, comparing\nit with implementations based on different technologies, including CMOS, ReRAM,\nand superconducting RSFQ/ERSFQ. Experimental results demonstrate that our\ndesign achieves an energy efficiency of approximately 7.8x10^4 times higher\nthan that of the ReRAM-based BNN framework while maintaining a similar level of\nmodel accuracy. Furthermore, when compared with superconductor-based\ncounterparts, our framework demonstrates at least two orders of magnitude\nhigher energy efficiency.",

Additionally, BTLM-3B-8K provides excellent long context\nperformance, outperforming MPT-7B-8K and XGen-7B-8K on tasks up to 8,192\ncontext length. We trained the model on a cleaned and deduplicated SlimPajama\ndataset; aggressively tuned the \\textmu P hyperparameters and schedule; used\nALiBi position embeddings; and adopted the SwiGLU nonlinearity.\n\nOn Hugging Face, the most popular models have 7B parameters, indicating that\nusers prefer the quality-size ratio of 7B models.

          "description": "A common formulation of constrained reinforcement learning involves multiple\nrewards that must individually accumulate to given thresholds. In this class of\nproblems, we show a simple example in which the desired optimal policy cannot\nbe induced by any weighted linear combination of rewards. Hence, there exist\nconstrained reinforcement learning problems for which neither regularized nor\nclassical primal-dual methods yield optimal policies. This work addresses this\nshortcoming by augmenting the state with Lagrange multipliers and\nreinterpreting primal-dual methods as the portion of the dynamics that drives\nthe multipliers evolution. This approach provides a systematic state\naugmentation procedure that is guaranteed to solve reinforcement learning\nproblems with constraints. Thus, as we illustrate by an example, while previous\nmethods can fail at finding optimal policies, running the dual dynamics while\nexecuting the augmented policy yields an algorithm that provably samples\nactions from the optimal policy.",

In the Offline Nanosatellite Task\nScheduling (ONTS) problem, the goal is to find the optimal schedule for tasks\nto be carried out in orbit while taking into account Quality-of-Service (QoS)\nconsiderations such as priority, minimum and maximum activation events,\nexecution time-frames, periods, and execution windows, as well as constraints\non the satellite's power resources and the complexity of energy harvesting and\nmanagement. The ONTS problem has been approached using conventional\nmathematical formulations and exact methods, but their applicability to\nchallenging cases of the problem is limited. This study examines the use of\nGNNs in this context, which has been effectively applied to optimization\nproblems such as the traveling salesman, scheduling, and facility placement\nproblems. More specifically, we investigate whether GNNs can learn the complex\nstructure of the ONTS problem with respect to feasibility and optimality of\ncandidate solutions. Furthermore, we evaluate using GNN-based heuristic\nsolutions to provide better solutions (w.r.t. the objective value) to the ONTS\nproblem and reduce the optimization cost. Our experiments show that GNNs are\nnot only able to learn feasibility and optimality for instances of the ONTS\nproblem, but they can generalize to harder instances than those seen during\ntraining. Furthermore, the GNN-based heuristics improved the expected objective\nvalue of the best solution found under the time limit in 45%, and reduced the\nexpected time to find a feasible solution in 35%, when compared to the SCIP\n(Solving Constraint Integer Programs) solver in its off-the-shelf configuration",

          "description": "We present ForceSight, a system for text-guided mobile manipulation that\npredicts visual-force goals using a deep neural network. Given a single RGBD\nimage combined with a text prompt, ForceSight determines a target end-effector\npose in the camera frame (kinematic goal) and the associated forces (force\ngoal). Together, these two components form a visual-force goal. Prior work has\ndemonstrated that deep models outputting human-interpretable kinematic goals\ncan enable dexterous manipulation by real robots. Forces are critical to\nmanipulation, yet have typically been relegated to lower-level execution in\nthese systems. When deployed on a mobile manipulator equipped with an\neye-in-hand RGBD camera, ForceSight performed tasks such as precision grasps,\ndrawer opening, and object handovers with an 81% success rate in unseen\nenvironments with object instances that differed significantly from the\ntraining data. In a separate experiment, relying exclusively on visual servoing\nand ignoring force goals dropped the success rate from 90% to 45%,\ndemonstrating that force goals can significantly enhance performance.

Approach: We use a problem transformation approach, in which actions\nwere subset into two biomechanically independent components - a set of wrist\ndirections and a set of finger modifiers. To maintain fast calibration time, we\ntrain models for each component using only individual gestures, and extrapolate\nto the full product space of combination gestures by generating synthetic data.\nWe collected a supervised dataset with high-confidence ground truth labels in\nwhich subjects performed combination gestures while holding a joystick, and\nconducted experiments to analyze the impact of model architectures, classifier\nalgorithms, and synthetic data generation strategies on the performance of the\nproposed approach. Main Results: We found that a problem transformation\napproach using a parallel model architecture in combination with a non-linear\nclassifier, along with restricted synthetic data generation, shows promise in\nincreasing the expressivity of sEMG-based gestures with a short calibration\ntime. Significance: sEMG-based gesture recognition has applications in\nhuman-computer interaction, virtual reality, and the control of robotic and\nprosthetic devices. Existing approaches require exhaustive model calibration.\nThe proposed approach increases expressivity without requiring users to\ndemonstrate all combination gesture classes. Our results may be extended to\nlarger gesture vocabularies and more complicated model architectures.",

          "description": "We present LongLoRA, an efficient fine-tuning approach that extends the\ncontext sizes of pre-trained large language models (LLMs), with limited\ncomputation cost. Typically, training LLMs with long context sizes is\ncomputationally expensive, requiring extensive training hours and GPU\nresources. For example, training on the context length of 8192 needs 16x\ncomputational costs in self-attention layers as that of 2048. In this paper, we\nspeed up the context extension of LLMs in two aspects. On the one hand,\nalthough dense global attention is needed during inference, fine-tuning the\nmodel can be effectively and efficiently done by sparse local attention. The\nproposed shift short attention effectively enables context extension, leading\nto non-trivial computation saving with similar performance to fine-tuning with\nvanilla attention. Particularly, it can be implemented with only two lines of\ncode in training, while being optional in inference. On the other hand, we\nrevisit the parameter-efficient fine-tuning regime for context expansion.\nNotably, we find that LoRA for context extension works well under the premise\nof trainable embedding and normalization. LongLoRA demonstrates strong\nempirical results on various tasks on LLaMA2 models from 7B/13B to 70B.\nLongLoRA adopts LLaMA2 7B from 4k context to 100k, or LLaMA2 70B to 32k on a\nsingle 8x A100 machine. LongLoRA extends models' context while retaining their\noriginal architectures, and is compatible with most existing techniques, like\nFlashAttention-2. In addition, to make LongLoRA practical, we collect a\ndataset, LongQA, for supervised fine-tuning. It contains more than 3k long\ncontext question-answer pairs.",

          "description": "Autistic Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a neurological disease characterized by\ndifficulties with social interaction, communication, and repetitive activities.\nThe severity of these difficulties varies, and those with this diagnosis face\nunique challenges. While its primary origin lies in genetics, identifying and\naddressing it early can contribute to the enhancement of the condition. In\nrecent years, machine learning-driven intelligent diagnosis has emerged as a\nsupplement to conventional clinical approaches, aiming to address the potential\ndrawbacks of time-consuming and costly traditional methods. In this work, we\nutilize different machine learning algorithms to find the most significant\ntraits responsible for ASD and to automate the diagnostic process. We study six\nclassification models to see which model works best to identify ASD and also\nstudy five popular clustering methods to get a meaningful insight of these ASD\ndatasets. To find the best classifier for these binary datasets, we evaluate\nthe models using accuracy, precision, recall, specificity, F1-score, AUC, kappa\nand log loss metrics. Our evaluation demonstrates that five out of the six\nselected models perform exceptionally, achieving a 100% accuracy rate on the\nASD datasets when hyperparameters are meticulously tuned for each model. As\nalmost all classification models are able to get 100% accuracy, we become\ninterested in observing the underlying insights of the datasets by implementing\nsome popular clustering algorithms on these datasets. We calculate Normalized\nMutual Information (NMI), Adjusted Rand Index (ARI) & Silhouette Coefficient\n(SC) metrics to select the best clustering models. Our evaluation finds that\nspectral clustering outperforms all other benchmarking clustering models in\nterms of NMI & ARI metrics and it also demonstrates comparability to the\noptimal SC achieved by k-means.",

          "description": "This paper studies the problem of traffic flow forecasting, which aims to\npredict future traffic conditions on the basis of road networks and traffic\nconditions in the past. The problem is typically solved by modeling complex\nspatio-temporal correlations in traffic data using spatio-temporal graph neural\nnetworks (GNNs). However, the performance of these methods is still far from\nsatisfactory since GNNs usually have limited representation capacity when it\ncomes to complex traffic networks. Graphs, by nature, fall short in capturing\nnon-pairwise relations. Even worse, existing methods follow the paradigm of\nmessage passing that aggregates neighborhood information linearly, which fails\nto capture complicated spatio-temporal high-order interactions. To tackle these\nissues, in this paper, we propose a novel model named Dynamic Hypergraph\nStructure Learning (DyHSL) for traffic flow prediction. To learn non-pairwise\nrelationships, our DyHSL extracts hypergraph structural information to model\ndynamics in the traffic networks, and updates each node representation by\naggregating messages from its associated hyperedges. Additionally, to capture\nhigh-order spatio-temporal relations in the road network, we introduce an\ninteractive graph convolution block, which further models the neighborhood\ninteraction for each node. Finally, we integrate these two views into a\nholistic multi-scale correlation extraction module, which conducts temporal\npooling with different scales to model different temporal patterns. Extensive\nexperiments on four popular traffic benchmark datasets demonstrate the\neffectiveness of our proposed DyHSL compared with a broad range of competing\nbaselines.",

          "description": "Linking sheet music images to audio recordings remains a key problem for the\ndevelopment of efficient cross-modal music retrieval systems. One of the\nfundamental approaches toward this task is to learn a cross-modal embedding\nspace via deep neural networks that is able to connect short snippets of audio\nand sheet music. However, the scarcity of annotated data from real musical\ncontent affects the capability of such methods to generalize to real retrieval\nscenarios. In this work, we investigate whether we can mitigate this limitation\nwith self-supervised contrastive learning, by exposing a network to a large\namount of real music data as a pre-training step, by contrasting randomly\naugmented views of snippets of both modalities, namely audio and sheet images.\nThrough a number of experiments on synthetic and real piano data, we show that\npre-trained models are able to retrieve snippets with better precision in all\nscenarios and pre-training configurations. Encouraged by these results, we\nemploy the snippet embeddings in the higher-level task of cross-modal piece\nidentification and conduct more experiments on several retrieval\nconfigurations. In this task, we observe that the retrieval quality improves\nfrom 30% up to 100% when real music data is present. We then conclude by\narguing for the potential of self-supervised contrastive learning for\nalleviating the annotated data scarcity in multi-modal music retrieval models.",

          "description": "Audiovisual data is everywhere in this digital age, which raises higher\nrequirements for the deep learning models developed on them. To well handle the\ninformation of the multi-modal data is the key to a better audiovisual modal.\nWe observe that these audiovisual data naturally have temporal attributes, such\nas the time information for each frame in the video. More concretely, such data\nis inherently multi-modal according to both audio and visual cues, which\nproceed in a strict chronological order. It indicates that temporal information\nis important in multi-modal acoustic event modeling for both intra- and\ninter-modal. However, existing methods deal with each modal feature\nindependently and simply fuse them together, which neglects the mining of\ntemporal relation and thus leads to sub-optimal performance. With this\nmotivation, we propose a Temporal Multi-modal graph learning method for\nAcoustic event Classification, called TMac, by modeling such temporal\ninformation via graph learning techniques. In particular, we construct a\ntemporal graph for each acoustic event, dividing its audio data and video data\ninto multiple segments. Each segment can be considered as a node, and the\ntemporal relationships between nodes can be considered as timestamps on their\nedges. In this case, we can smoothly capture the dynamic information in\nintra-modal and inter-modal. Several experiments are conducted to demonstrate\nTMac outperforms other SOTA models in performance.

          "description": "Deep learning's immense capabilities are often constrained by the complexity\nof its models, leading to an increasing demand for effective sparsification\ntechniques. Bayesian sparsification for deep learning emerges as a crucial\napproach, facilitating the design of models that are both computationally\nefficient and competitive in terms of performance across various deep learning\napplications. The state-of-the-art -- in Bayesian sparsification of deep neural\nnetworks -- combines structural shrinkage priors on model weights with an\napproximate inference scheme based on black-box stochastic variational\ninference. However, model inversion of the full generative model is\nexceptionally computationally demanding, especially when compared to standard\ndeep learning of point estimates. In this context, we advocate for the use of\nBayesian model reduction (BMR) as a more efficient alternative for pruning of\nmodel weights. As a generalization of the Savage-Dickey ratio, BMR allows a\npost-hoc elimination of redundant model weights based on the posterior\nestimates under a straightforward (non-hierarchical) generative model. Our\ncomparative study highlights the computational efficiency and the pruning rate\nof the BMR method relative to the established stochastic variational inference\n(SVI) scheme, when applied to the full hierarchical generative model. We\nillustrate the potential of BMR to prune model parameters across various deep\nlearning architectures, from classical networks like LeNet to modern frameworks\nsuch as Vision Transformers and MLP-Mixers.",

          "description": "Surrogate-assisted evolutionary algorithms (SAEAs) hold significant\nimportance in resolving expensive optimization problems~(EOPs). Extensive\nefforts have been devoted to improving the efficacy of SAEAs through the\ndevelopment of proficient model-assisted selection methods. However, generating\nhigh-quality solutions is a prerequisite for selection. The fundamental\nparadigm of evaluating a limited number of solutions in each generation within\nSAEAs reduces the variance of adjacent populations, thus impacting the quality\nof offspring solutions. This is a frequently encountered issue, yet it has not\ngained widespread attention. This paper presents a framework using unevaluated\nsolutions to enhance the efficiency of SAEAs. The surrogate model is employed\nto identify high-quality solutions for direct generation of new solutions\nwithout evaluation. To ensure dependable selection, we have introduced two\ntailored relation models for the selection of the optimal solution and the\nunevaluated population. A comprehensive experimental analysis is performed on\ntwo test suites, which showcases the superiority of the relation model over\nregression and classification models in the selection phase. Furthermore, the\nsurrogate-selected unevaluated solutions with high potential have been shown to\nsignificantly enhance the efficiency of the algorithm.",

In this paper, we present\nTactile Adaptation from Visual Incentives (TAVI), a new framework that enhances\ntactile-based dexterity by optimizing dexterous policies using vision-based\nrewards. First, we use a contrastive-based objective to learn visual\nrepresentations. Next, we construct a reward function using these visual\nrepresentations through optimal-transport based matching on one human\ndemonstration. Finally, we use online reinforcement learning on our robot to\noptimize tactile-based policies that maximize the visual reward. On six\nchallenging tasks, such as peg pick-and-place, unstacking bowls, and flipping\nslender objects, TAVI achieves a success rate of 73% using our four-fingered\nAllegro robot hand. The increase in performance is 108% higher than policies\nusing tactile and vision-based rewards and 135% higher than policies without\ntactile observational input.

This problem of \\emph{adaptive data analysis} was\nformalized in the seminal works of Dwork et al.

This result shows that the noise inherent in subsampling is\nsufficient to guarantee that query responses generalize. The simplicity of this\nsubsampling-based framework allows it to model a variety of real-world\nscenarios not covered by prior work.\n\nIn addition to its simplicity, we demonstrate the utility of this framework\nby designing mechanisms for two foundational tasks, statistical queries and\nmedian finding.

The state-of-the-art notion for\nprovable privacy-properties is differential privacy, which requires that the\nimpact of single data points is limited and deniable. We introduce a novel\ndifferentially private GBDT learner and utilize four main techniques to improve\nthe utility-privacy tradeoff. (1) We use an improved noise scaling approach\nwith tighter accounting of privacy leakage of a decision tree leaf compared to\nprior work, resulting in noise that in expectation scales with $O(1/n)$, for\n$n$ data points. (2) We integrate individual R\\'enyi filters to our method to\nlearn from data points that have been underutilized during an iterative\ntraining process, which -- potentially of independent interest -- results in a\nnatural yet effective insight to learning streams of non-i.i.d. data. (3) We\nincorporate the concept of random decision tree splits to concentrate privacy\nbudget on learning leaves. (4) We deploy subsampling for privacy amplification.\nOur evaluation shows for the Abalone dataset ($<4k$ training data points) a\n$R^2$-score of $0.39$ for $\\varepsilon=0.15$, which the closest prior work only\nachieved for $\\varepsilon=10.0$. On the Adult dataset ($50k$ training data\npoints) we achieve test error of $18.7\\,\\%$ for $\\varepsilon=0.07$ which the\nclosest prior work only achieved for $\\varepsilon=1.0$. For the Abalone dataset\nfor $\\varepsilon=0.54$ we achieve $R^2$-score of $0.47$ which is very close to\nthe $R^2$-score of $0.54$ for the nonprivate version of GBDT. For the Adult\ndataset for $\\varepsilon=0.54$ we achieve test error $17.1\\,\\%$ which is very\nclose to the test error $13.7\\,\\%$ of the nonprivate version of GBDT.",

          "description": "Virtual screening of large compound libraries to identify potential hit\ncandidates is one of the earliest steps in drug discovery. As the size of\ncommercially available compound collections grows exponentially to the scale of\nbillions, brute-force virtual screening using traditional tools such as docking\nbecomes infeasible in terms of time and computational resources. Active\nlearning and Bayesian optimization has recently been proven as effective\nmethods of narrowing down the search space. An essential component in those\nmethods is a surrogate machine learning model that is trained with a small\nsubset of the library to predict the desired properties of compounds. Accurate\nmodel can achieve high sample efficiency by finding the most promising\ncompounds with only a fraction of the whole library being virtually screened.\nIn this study, we examined the performance of pretrained transformer-based\nlanguage model and graph neural network in Bayesian optimization active\nlearning framework. The best pretrained models identifies 58.97% of the\ntop-50000 by docking score after screening only 0.6% of an ultra-large library\ncontaining 99.5 million compounds, improving 8% over previous state-of-the-art\nbaseline.

          "description": "Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is crucial to modern deep learning\napplications by identifying and alerting about the OOD samples that should not\nbe tested or used for making predictions. Current OOD detection methods have\nmade significant progress when in-distribution (ID) and OOD samples are drawn\nfrom static distributions. However, this can be unrealistic when applied to\nreal-world systems which often undergo continuous variations and shifts in ID\nand OOD distributions over time. Therefore, for an effective application in\nreal-world systems, the development of OOD detection methods that can adapt to\nthese dynamic and evolving distributions is essential. In this paper, we\npropose a novel and more realistic setting called continuously adaptive\nout-of-distribution (CAOOD) detection which targets on developing an OOD\ndetection model that enables dynamic and quick adaptation to a new arriving\ndistribution, with insufficient ID samples during deployment time. To address\nCAOOD, we develop meta OOD learning (MOL) by designing a learning-to-adapt\ndiagram such that a good initialized OOD detection model is learned during the\ntraining process. In the testing process, MOL ensures OOD detection performance\nover shifting distributions by quickly adapting to new distributions with a few\nadaptations. Extensive experiments on several OOD benchmarks endorse the\neffectiveness of our method in preserving both ID classification accuracy and\nOOD detection performance on continuously shifting distributions.",

          "description": "We expose a surprising failure of generalization in auto-regressive large\nlanguage models (LLMs). If a model is trained on a sentence of the form \"A is\nB\", it will not automatically generalize to the reverse direction \"B is A\".\nThis is the Reversal Curse. For instance, if a model is trained on \"Olaf Scholz\nwas the ninth Chancellor of Germany\", it will not automatically be able to\nanswer the question, \"Who was the ninth Chancellor of Germany?\". Moreover, the\nlikelihood of the correct answer (\"Olaf Scholz\") will not be higher than for a\nrandom name. Thus, models exhibit a basic failure of logical deduction and do\nnot generalize a prevalent pattern in their training set (i.e. if \"A is B''\noccurs, \"B is A\" is more likely to occur). We provide evidence for the Reversal\nCurse by finetuning GPT-3 and Llama-1 on fictitious statements such as \"Uriah\nHawthorne is the composer of 'Abyssal Melodies'\" and showing that they fail to\ncorrectly answer \"Who composed 'Abyssal Melodies?'\". The Reversal Curse is\nrobust across model sizes and model families and is not alleviated by data\naugmentation. We also evaluate ChatGPT (GPT-3.5 and GPT-4) on questions about\nreal-world celebrities, such as \"Who is Tom Cruise's mother? [A: Mary Lee\nPfeiffer]\" and the reverse \"Who is Mary Lee Pfeiffer's son?\". GPT-4 correctly\nanswers questions like the former 79% of the time, compared to 33% for the\nlatter.

          "description": "Structure learning is the crux of causal inference. Notably, causal discovery\n(CD) algorithms are brittle when data is scarce, possibly inferring imprecise\ncausal relations that contradict expert knowledge -- especially when\nconsidering latent confounders. To aggravate the issue, most CD methods do not\nprovide uncertainty estimates, making it hard for users to interpret results\nand improve the inference process. Surprisingly, while CD is a human-centered\naffair, no works have focused on building methods that both 1) output\nuncertainty estimates that can be verified by experts and 2) interact with\nthose experts to iteratively refine CD. To solve these issues, we start by\nproposing to sample (causal) ancestral graphs proportionally to a belief\ndistribution based on a score function, such as the Bayesian information\ncriterion (BIC), using generative flow networks. Then, we leverage the\ndiversity in candidate graphs and introduce an optimal experimental design to\niteratively probe the expert about the relations among variables, effectively\nreducing the uncertainty of our belief over ancestral graphs. Finally, we\nupdate our samples to incorporate human feedback via importance sampling.\nImportantly, our method does not require causal sufficiency (i.e., unobserved\nconfounders may exist).

          "description": "We consider the problem of learning multiple tasks in a continual learning\nsetting in which data from different tasks is presented to the learner in a\nstreaming fashion. A key challenge in this setting is the so-called\n\"catastrophic forgetting problem\", in which the performance of the learner in\nan \"old task\" decreases when subsequently trained on a \"new task\". Existing\ncontinual learning methods, such as Averaged Gradient Episodic Memory (A-GEM)\nand Orthogonal Gradient Descent (OGD), address catastrophic forgetting by\nminimizing the loss for the current task without increasing the loss for\nprevious tasks. However, these methods assume the learner knows when the task\nchanges, which is unrealistic in practice. In this paper, we alleviate the need\nto provide the algorithm with information about task changes by using an online\nclustering-based approach on a dynamically updated finite pool of samples or\ngradients. We thereby successfully counteract catastrophic forgetting in one of\nthe hardest settings, namely: domain-incremental learning, a setting for which\nthe problem was previously unsolved. We showcase the benefits of our approach\nby applying these ideas to projection-based methods, such as A-GEM and OGD,\nwhich lead to task-agnostic versions of them. Experiments on real datasets\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed strategy and its promising\nperformance compared to state-of-the-art methods.",

          "description": "New roads are being constructed all the time. However, the capabilities of\nprevious deep forecasting models to generalize to new roads not seen in the\ntraining data (unseen roads) are rarely explored. In this paper, we introduce a\nnovel setup called a spatio-temporal (ST) split to evaluate the models'\ncapabilities to generalize to unseen roads. In this setup, the models are\ntrained on data from a sample of roads, but tested on roads not seen in the\ntraining data. Moreover, we also present a novel framework called Spatial\nContrastive Pre-Training (SCPT) where we introduce a spatial encoder module to\nextract latent features from unseen roads during inference time. This spatial\nencoder is pre-trained using contrastive learning. During inference, the\nspatial encoder only requires two days of traffic data on the new roads and\ndoes not require any re-training. We also show that the output from the spatial\nencoder can be used effectively to infer latent node embeddings on unseen roads\nduring inference time. The SCPT framework also incorporates a new layer, named\nthe spatially gated addition (SGA) layer, to effectively combine the latent\nfeatures from the output of the spatial encoder to existing backbones.\nAdditionally, since there is limited data on the unseen roads, we argue that it\nis better to decouple traffic signals to trivial-to-capture periodic signals\nand difficult-to-capture Markovian signals, and for the spatial encoder to only\nlearn the Markovian signals. Finally, we empirically evaluated SCPT using the\nST split setup on four real-world datasets. The results showed that adding SCPT\nto a backbone consistently improves forecasting performance on unseen roads.\nMore importantly, the improvements are greater when forecasting further into\nthe future.

          "description": "There is a correlation between adjacent channels of electroencephalogram\n(EEG), and how to represent this correlation is an issue that is currently\nbeing explored. In addition, due to inter-individual differences in EEG\nsignals, this discrepancy results in new subjects need spend a amount of\ncalibration time for EEG-based motor imagery brain-computer interface. In order\nto solve the above problems, we propose a Dynamic Domain Adaptation Based Deep\nLearning Network (DADL-Net). First, the EEG data is mapped to the\nthree-dimensional geometric space and its temporal-spatial features are learned\nthrough the 3D convolution module, and then the spatial-channel attention\nmechanism is used to strengthen the features, and the final convolution module\ncan further learn the spatial-temporal information of the features. Finally, to\naccount for inter-subject and cross-sessions differences, we employ a dynamic\ndomain-adaptive strategy, the distance between features is reduced by\nintroducing a Maximum Mean Discrepancy loss function, and the classification\nlayer is fine-tuned by using part of the target domain data. We verify the\nperformance of the proposed method on BCI competition IV 2a and OpenBMI\ndatasets. Under the intra-subject experiment, the accuracy rates of 70.42% and\n73.91% were achieved on the OpenBMI and BCIC IV 2a datasets.",

Furthermore, the DCT layer includes trainable hard-thresholding\nparameters and scaling layers to give emphasis or de-emphasis on individual DCT\ncoefficients. Finally, the one-by-one convolutional layer generates the latent\nspace. The sparsity penalty-based cost function is employed to keep the feature\nmap as sparse as possible in the latent space. The latent space data is\ntransmitted to the receiver. The decoder module of the autoencoder is designed\nusing the inverse DCT and two fully connected linear layers to improve the\naccuracy of data reconstruction.

          "description": "Most existing works on federated bandits take it for granted that all clients\nare altruistic about sharing their data with the server for the collective good\nwhenever needed. Despite their compelling theoretical guarantee on performance\nand communication efficiency, this assumption is overly idealistic and\noftentimes violated in practice, especially when the algorithm is operated over\nself-interested clients, who are reluctant to share data without explicit\nbenefits. Negligence of such self-interested behaviors can significantly affect\nthe learning efficiency and even the practical operability of federated bandit\nlearning. In light of this, we aim to spark new insights into this\nunder-explored research area by formally introducing an incentivized\ncommunication problem for federated bandits, where the server shall motivate\nclients to share data by providing incentives. Without loss of generality, we\ninstantiate this bandit problem with the contextual linear setting and propose\nthe first incentivized communication protocol, namely, Inc-FedUCB, that\nachieves near-optimal regret with provable communication and incentive cost\nguarantees.

          "description": "Federated learning is a distributed machine learning system that uses\nparticipants' data to train an improved global model. In federated learning,\nparticipants cooperatively train a global model, and they will receive the\nglobal model and payments. Rational participants try to maximize their\nindividual utility, and they will not input their high-quality data truthfully\nunless they are provided with satisfactory payments based on their data\nquality. Furthermore, federated learning benefits from the cooperative\ncontributions of participants. Accordingly, how to establish an incentive\nmechanism that both incentivizes inputting data truthfully and promotes stable\ncooperation has become an important issue to consider. In this paper, we\nintroduce a data sharing game model for federated learning and employ\ngame-theoretic approaches to design a core-selecting incentive mechanism by\nutilizing a popular concept in cooperative games, the core. In federated\nlearning, the core can be empty, resulting in the core-selecting mechanism\nbecoming infeasible. To address this, our core-selecting mechanism employs a\nrelaxation method and simultaneously minimizes the benefits of inputting false\ndata for all participants. However, this mechanism is computationally expensive\nbecause it requires aggregating exponential models for all possible coalitions,\nwhich is infeasible in federated learning. To address this, we propose an\nefficient core-selecting mechanism based on sampling approximation that only\naggregates models on sampled coalitions to approximate the exact result.\nExtensive experiments verify that the efficient core-selecting mechanism can\nincentivize inputting high-quality data and stable cooperation, while it\nreduces computational overhead compared to the core-selecting mechanism.",

          "description": "Quantum machine learning is a promising programming paradigm for the\noptimization of quantum algorithms in the current era of noisy intermediate\nscale quantum (NISQ) computers. A fundamental challenge in quantum machine\nlearning is generalization, as the designer targets performance under testing\nconditions, while having access only to limited training data. Existing\ngeneralization analyses, while identifying important general trends and scaling\nlaws, cannot be used to assign reliable and informative \"error bars\" to the\ndecisions made by quantum models. In this article, we propose a general\nmethodology that can reliably quantify the uncertainty of quantum models,\nirrespective of the amount of training data, of the number of shots, of the\nansatz, of the training algorithm, and of the presence of quantum hardware\nnoise. The approach, which builds on probabilistic conformal prediction, turns\nan arbitrary, possibly small, number of shots from a pre-trained quantum model\ninto a set prediction, e.g., an interval, that provably contains the true\ntarget with any desired coverage level. Experimental results confirm the\ntheoretical calibration guarantees of the proposed framework, referred to as\nquantum conformal prediction.",

          "description": "Hierarchical reinforcement learning has been a compelling approach for\nachieving goal directed behavior over long sequences of actions. However, it\nhas been challenging to implement in realistic or open-ended environments. A\nmain challenge has been to find the right space of sub-goals over which to\ninstantiate a hierarchy. We present a novel approach where we use data from\nhumans solving these tasks to softly supervise the goal space for a set of long\nrange tasks in a 3D embodied environment. In particular, we use unconstrained\nnatural language to parameterize this space. This has two advantages: first, it\nis easy to generate this data from naive human participants; second, it is\nflexible enough to represent a vast range of sub-goals in human-relevant tasks.\nOur approach outperforms agents that clone expert behavior on these tasks, as\nwell as HRL from scratch without this supervised sub-goal space. Our work\npresents a novel approach to combining human expert supervision with the\nbenefits and flexibility of reinforcement learning.",

          "description": "Generalized Additive Models (GAMs) are widely used explainable-by-design\nmodels in various applications. GAMs assume that the output can be represented\nas a sum of univariate functions, referred to as components. However, this\nassumption fails in ML problems where the output depends on multiple features\nsimultaneously. In these cases, GAMs fail to capture the interaction terms of\nthe underlying function, leading to subpar accuracy. To (partially) address\nthis issue, we propose Regionally Additive Models (RAMs), a novel class of\nexplainable-by-design models. RAMs identify subregions within the feature space\nwhere interactions are minimized. Within these regions, it is more accurate to\nexpress the output as a sum of univariate functions (components). Consequently,\nRAMs fit one component per subregion of each feature instead of one component\nper feature. This approach yields a more expressive model compared to GAMs\nwhile retaining interpretability. The RAM framework consists of three steps.\nFirstly, we train a black-box model. Secondly, using Regional Effect Plots, we\nidentify subregions where the black-box model exhibits near-local additivity.\nLastly, we fit a GAM component for each identified subregion. We validate the\neffectiveness of RAMs through experiments on both synthetic and real-world\ndatasets. The results confirm that RAMs offer improved expressiveness compared\nto GAMs while maintaining interpretability.",

          "description": "The use of skills (a.k.a., options) can greatly accelerate exploration in\nreinforcement learning, especially when only sparse reward signals are\navailable. While option discovery methods have been proposed for individual\nagents, in multi-agent reinforcement learning settings, discovering\ncollaborative options that can coordinate the behavior of multiple agents and\nencourage them to visit the under-explored regions of their joint state space\nhas not been considered. In this case, we propose Multi-agent Deep Covering\nOption Discovery, which constructs the multi-agent options through minimizing\nthe expected cover time of the multiple agents' joint state space. Also, we\npropose a novel framework to adopt the multi-agent options in the MARL process.\nIn practice, a multi-agent task can usually be divided into some sub-tasks,\neach of which can be completed by a sub-group of the agents. Therefore, our\nalgorithm framework first leverages an attention mechanism to find\ncollaborative agent sub-groups that would benefit most from coordinated\nactions. Then, a hierarchical algorithm, namely HA-MSAC, is developed to learn\nthe multi-agent options for each sub-group to complete their sub-tasks first,\nand then to integrate them through a high-level policy as the solution of the\nwhole task. This hierarchical option construction allows our framework to\nstrike a balance between scalability and effective collaboration among the\nagents. The evaluation based on multi-agent collaborative tasks shows that the\nproposed algorithm can effectively capture the agent interactions with the\nattention mechanism, successfully identify multi-agent options, and\nsignificantly outperforms prior works using single-agent options or no options,\nin terms of both faster exploration and higher task rewards.",

          "description": "Designing reward functions is a longstanding challenge in reinforcement\nlearning (RL); it requires specialized knowledge or domain data, leading to\nhigh costs for development. To address this, we introduce Text2Reward, a\ndata-free framework that automates the generation of dense reward functions\nbased on large language models (LLMs). Given a goal described in natural\nlanguage, Text2Reward generates dense reward functions as an executable program\ngrounded in a compact representation of the environment. Unlike inverse RL and\nrecent work that uses LLMs to write sparse reward codes, Text2Reward produces\ninterpretable, free-form dense reward codes that cover a wide range of tasks,\nutilize existing packages, and allow iterative refinement with human feedback.\nWe evaluate Text2Reward on two robotic manipulation benchmarks (ManiSkill2,\nMetaWorld) and two locomotion environments of MuJoCo. On 13 of the 17\nmanipulation tasks, policies trained with generated reward codes achieve\nsimilar or better task success rates and convergence speed than expert-written\nreward codes. For locomotion tasks, our method learns six novel locomotion\nbehaviors with a success rate exceeding 94%. Furthermore, we show that the\npolicies trained in the simulator with our method can be deployed in the real\nworld. Finally, Text2Reward further improves the policies by refining their\nreward functions with human feedback. Video results are available at\nhttps://text-to-reward.github.io",

          "description": "This paper introduces Bayesian Flow Networks (BFNs), a new class of\ngenerative model in which the parameters of a set of independent distributions\nare modified with Bayesian inference in the light of noisy data samples, then\npassed as input to a neural network that outputs a second, interdependent\ndistribution. Starting from a simple prior and iteratively updating the two\ndistributions yields a generative procedure similar to the reverse process of\ndiffusion models; however it is conceptually simpler in that no forward process\nis required. Discrete and continuous-time loss functions are derived for\ncontinuous, discretised and discrete data, along with sample generation\nprocedures. Notably, the network inputs for discrete data lie on the\nprobability simplex, and are therefore natively differentiable, paving the way\nfor gradient-based sample guidance and few-step generation in discrete domains\nsuch as language modelling. The loss function directly optimises data\ncompression and places no restrictions on the network architecture. In our\nexperiments BFNs achieve competitive log-likelihoods for image modelling on\ndynamically binarized MNIST and CIFAR-10, and outperform all known discrete\ndiffusion models on the text8 character-level language modelling task.",

          "description": "The recommendation of appropriate development pathways, also known as\necological civilization patterns for achieving Sustainable Development Goals\n(namely, sustainable development patterns), are of utmost importance for\npromoting ecological, economic, social, and resource sustainability in a\nspecific region. To achieve this, the recommendation process must carefully\nconsider the region's natural, environmental, resource, and economic\ncharacteristics. However, current recommendation algorithms in the field of\ncomputer science fall short in adequately addressing the spatial heterogeneity\nrelated to environment and sparsity of regional historical interaction data,\nwhich limits their effectiveness in recommending sustainable development\npatterns. To overcome these challenges, this paper proposes a method called\nUser Graph after Pruning and Intent Graph (UGPIG). Firstly, we utilize the\nhigh-density linking capability of the pruned User Graph to address the issue\nof spatial heterogeneity neglect in recommendation algorithms. Secondly, we\nconstruct an Intent Graph by incorporating the intent network, which captures\nthe preferences for attributes including environmental elements of target\nregions. This approach effectively alleviates the problem of sparse historical\ninteraction data in the region. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate\nthat UGPIG outperforms state-of-the-art recommendation algorithms like KGCN,\nKGAT, and KGIN in sustainable development pattern recommendations, with a\nmaximum improvement of 9.61% in Top-3 recommendation performance.",

By leveraging conditional\nadversarial training on K-anonymized human mobility matrices, trajectory global\ncontext learning using the attention-based mechanism, and recurrent bipartite\ngraph matching of adjacent trajectory points, CATS is able to reconstruct\ntrajectory topology from conditionally sampled locations and generate\nhigh-quality individual-level synthetic trajectory data, which can serve as\nsupplements or alternatives to raw data for privacy-preserving trajectory data\npublication. The experiment results on over 90k GPS trajectories show that our\nmethod has a better performance in privacy preservation, spatiotemporal\ncharacteristic preservation, and downstream utility compared with baseline\nmethods, which brings new insights into privacy-preserving human mobility\nresearch using generative AI techniques and explores data ethics issues in\nGIScience.",

          "description": "Motivated by applications in queueing theory, we consider a stochastic\ncontrol problem whose state space is the $d$-dimensional positive orthant. The\ncontrolled process $Z$ evolves as a reflected Brownian motion whose covariance\nmatrix is exogenously specified, as are its directions of reflection from the\northant's boundary surfaces. A system manager chooses a drift vector\n$\\theta(t)$ at each time $t$ based on the history of $Z$, and the cost rate at\ntime $t$ depends on both $Z(t)$ and $\\theta(t)$. In our initial problem\nformulation, the objective is to minimize expected discounted cost over an\ninfinite planning horizon, after which we treat the corresponding ergodic\ncontrol problem. Extending earlier work by Han et al.

          "description": "We consider the problem of training private recommendation models with access\nto public item features. Training with Differential Privacy (DP) offers strong\nprivacy guarantees, at the expense of loss in recommendation quality. We show\nthat incorporating public item features during training can help mitigate this\nloss in quality. We propose a general approach based on collective matrix\nfactorization (CMF), that works by simultaneously factorizing two matrices: the\nuser feedback matrix (representing sensitive data) and an item feature matrix\nthat encodes publicly available (non-sensitive) item information.\n\nThe method is conceptually simple, easy to tune, and highly scalable. It can\nbe applied to different types of public item data, including: (1) categorical\nitem features; (2) item-item similarities learned from public sources; and (3)\npublicly available user feedback. Furthermore, these data modalities can be\ncollectively utilized to fully leverage public data.\n\nEvaluating our method on a standard DP recommendation benchmark, we find that\nusing public item features significantly narrows the quality gap between\nprivate models and their non-private counterparts. As privacy constraints\nbecome more stringent, models rely more heavily on public side features for\nrecommendation. This results in a smooth transition from collaborative\nfiltering to item-based contextual recommendations.",

However, due to the unsolved adversarial robustness\nproblem of vision models, MLLMs can have more severe safety and security risks\nby introducing the vision inputs. In this work, we study the adversarial\nrobustness of Google's Bard, a competitive chatbot to ChatGPT that released its\nmultimodal capability recently, to better understand the vulnerabilities of\ncommercial MLLMs. By attacking white-box surrogate vision encoders or MLLMs,\nthe generated adversarial examples can mislead Bard to output wrong image\ndescriptions with a 22% success rate based solely on the transferability. We\nshow that the adversarial examples can also attack other MLLMs, e.g., a 26%\nattack success rate against Bing Chat and a 86% attack success rate against\nERNIE bot. Moreover, we identify two defense mechanisms of Bard, including face\ndetection and toxicity detection of images. We design corresponding attacks to\nevade these defenses, demonstrating that the current defenses of Bard are also\nvulnerable. We hope this work can deepen our understanding on the robustness of\nMLLMs and facilitate future research on defenses. Our code is available at\nhttps://github.com/thu-ml/Attack-Bard.",

          "description": "Self-supervised representation learning has seen remarkable progress in the\nlast few years, with some of the recent methods being able to learn useful\nimage representations without labels. These methods are trained using\nbackpropagation, the de facto standard. Recently, Geoffrey Hinton proposed the\nforward-forward algorithm as an alternative training method. It utilizes two\nforward passes and a separate loss function for each layer to train the network\nwithout backpropagation.\n\nIn this study, for the first time, we study the performance of\nforward-forward vs. backpropagation for self-supervised representation learning\nand provide insights into the learned representation spaces. Our benchmark\nemploys four standard datasets, namely MNIST, F-MNIST, SVHN and CIFAR-10, and\nthree commonly used self-supervised representation learning techniques, namely\nrotation, flip and jigsaw.\n\nOur main finding is that while the forward-forward algorithm performs\ncomparably to backpropagation during (self-)supervised training, the transfer\nperformance is significantly lagging behind in all the studied settings. This\nmay be caused by a combination of factors, including having a loss function for\neach layer and the way the supervised training is realized in the\nforward-forward paradigm. In comparison to backpropagation, the forward-forward\nalgorithm focuses more on the boundaries and drops part of the information\nunnecessary for making decisions which harms the representation learning goal.\nFurther investigation and research are necessary to stabilize the\nforward-forward strategy for self-supervised learning, to work beyond the\ndatasets and configurations demonstrated by Geoffrey Hinton.",

          "description": "Many applications of cross-modal music retrieval are related to connecting\nsheet music images to audio recordings. A typical and recent approach to this\nis to learn, via deep neural networks, a joint embedding space that correlates\nshort fixed-size snippets of audio and sheet music by means of an appropriate\nsimilarity structure. However, two challenges that arise out of this strategy\nare the requirement of strongly aligned data to train the networks, and the\ninherent discrepancies of musical content between audio and sheet music\nsnippets caused by local and global tempo differences. In this paper, we\naddress these two shortcomings by designing a cross-modal recurrent network\nthat learns joint embeddings that can summarize longer passages of\ncorresponding audio and sheet music. The benefits of our method are that it\nonly requires weakly aligned audio-sheet music pairs, as well as that the\nrecurrent network handles the non-linearities caused by tempo variations\nbetween audio and sheet music. We conduct a number of experiments on synthetic\nand real piano data and scores, showing that our proposed recurrent method\nleads to more accurate retrieval in all possible configurations.",

          "description": "Ad-load balancing is a critical challenge in online advertising systems,\nparticularly in the context of social media platforms, where the goal is to\nmaximize user engagement and revenue while maintaining a satisfactory user\nexperience. This requires the optimization of conflicting objectives, such as\nuser satisfaction and ads revenue. Traditional approaches to ad-load balancing\nrely on static allocation policies, which fail to adapt to changing user\npreferences and contextual factors. In this paper, we present an approach that\nleverages off-policy learning and evaluation from logged bandit feedback. We\nstart by presenting a motivating analysis of the ad-load balancing problem,\nhighlighting the conflicting objectives between user satisfaction and ads\nrevenue. We emphasize the nuances that arise due to user heterogeneity and the\ndependence on the user's position within a session. Based on this analysis, we\ndefine the problem as determining the optimal ad-load for a particular feed\nfetch. To tackle this problem, we propose an off-policy learning framework that\nleverages unbiased estimators such as Inverse Propensity Scoring (IPS) and\nDoubly Robust (DR) to learn and estimate the policy values using offline\ncollected stochastic data. We present insights from online A/B experiments\ndeployed at scale across over 80 million users generating over 200 million\nsessions, where we find statistically significant improvements in both user\nsatisfaction metrics and ads revenue for the platform.",

To\nthe best of our knowledge, we are the first to achieve differential privacy in\nsequential recommendation with dependent interactions. Specifically, in\nDIPSGNN, we first leverage piecewise mechanism to protect sensitive user\nfeatures. Then, we innovatively add calibrated noise into aggregation step of\ngraph neural network based on aggregation perturbation mechanism. And this\nnoisy graph neural network can protect sequentially dependent interactions and\ncapture user preferences simultaneously. Extensive experiments demonstrate the\nsuperiority of our method over state-of-the-art differentially private\nrecommender systems in terms of better balance between privacy and accuracy.",

This paper proposes a framework for the generative\ndesign of structural components. Specifically, we employ a Latent Diffusion\nmodel to generate potential designs of a component that can satisfy a set of\nproblem-specific loading conditions. One of the distinct advantages our\napproach offers over other generative approaches, such as generative\nadversarial networks (GANs), is that it permits the editing of existing\ndesigns. We train our model using a dataset of geometries obtained from\nstructural topology optimization utilizing the SIMP algorithm. Consequently,\nour framework generates inherently near-optimal designs. Our work presents\nquantitative results that support the structural performance of the generated\ndesigns and the variability in potential candidate designs. Furthermore, we\nprovide evidence of the scalability of our framework by operating over voxel\ndomains with resolutions varying from $32^3$ to $128^3$. Our framework can be\nused as a starting point for generating novel near-optimal designs similar to\ntopology-optimized designs.",

          "description": "Fully-connected deep neural networks with weights initialized from\nindependent Gaussian distributions can be tuned to criticality, which prevents\nthe exponential growth or decay of signals propagating through the network.\nHowever, such networks still exhibit fluctuations that grow linearly with the\ndepth of the network, which may impair the training of networks with width\ncomparable to depth. We show analytically that rectangular networks with tanh\nactivations and weights initialized from the ensemble of orthogonal matrices\nhave corresponding preactivation fluctuations which are independent of depth,\nto leading order in inverse width. Moreover, we demonstrate numerically that,\nat initialization, all correlators involving the neural tangent kernel (NTK)\nand its descendants at leading order in inverse width -- which govern the\nevolution of observables during training -- saturate at a depth of $\\sim 20$,\nrather than growing without bound as in the case of Gaussian initializations.\nWe speculate that this structure preserves finite-width feature learning while\nreducing overall noise, thus improving both generalization and training speed.\nWe provide some experimental justification by relating empirical measurements\nof the NTK to the superior performance of deep nonlinear orthogonal networks\ntrained under full-batch gradient descent on the MNIST and CIFAR-10\nclassification tasks.",

This work shows that the only prior distribution on\n$X$ that induces linearity in the conditional median is Gaussian.\n\nAlong the way, several other results are presented. In particular, it is\ndemonstrated that if the conditional distribution $P_{X|Y=y}$ is symmetric for\nall $y$, then $X$ must follow a Gaussian distribution. Additionally, we\nconsider other $L^p$ losses and observe the following phenomenon: for $p \\in\n[1,2]$, Gaussian is the only prior distribution that induces a linear optimal\nBayesian estimator, and for $p \\in (2,\\infty)$, infinitely many prior\ndistributions on $X$ can induce linearity.

Specifically, we investigate the optimal approach for\napproximating the posterior, analyze the connection between posterior quality\nand uncertainty quantification, delve into the impact of modes on the\nposterior, and explore methods for visualizing the posterior. Moreover, we\nuncover weight-space symmetries as a critical aspect for understanding the\nposterior.

          "description": "The 2022 National Defense Strategy of the United States listed climate change\nas a serious threat to national security. Climate intervention methods, such as\nstratospheric aerosol injection, have been proposed as mitigation strategies,\nbut the downstream effects of such actions on a complex climate system are not\nwell understood. The development of algorithmic techniques for quantifying\nrelationships between source and impact variables related to a climate event\n(i.e., a climate pathway) would help inform policy decisions. Data-driven deep\nlearning models have become powerful tools for modeling highly nonlinear\nrelationships and may provide a route to characterize climate variable\nrelationships. In this paper, we explore the use of an echo state network (ESN)\nfor characterizing climate pathways. ESNs are a computationally efficient\nneural network variation designed for temporal data, and recent work proposes\nESNs as a useful tool for forecasting spatio-temporal climate data. Like other\nneural networks, ESNs are non-interpretable black-box models, which poses a\nhurdle for understanding variable relationships. We address this issue by\ndeveloping feature importance methods for ESNs in the context of\nspatio-temporal data to quantify variable relationships captured by the model.\nWe conduct a simulation study to assess and compare the feature importance\ntechniques, and we demonstrate the approach on reanalysis climate data. In the\nclimate application, we select a time period that includes the 1991 volcanic\neruption of Mount Pinatubo. This event was a significant stratospheric aerosol\ninjection, which we use as a proxy for an artificial stratospheric aerosol\ninjection. Using the proposed approach, we are able to characterize\nrelationships between pathway variables associated with this event.",

          "description": "Incomplete knowledge of the environment leads an agent to make decisions\nunder uncertainty. One of the major dilemmas in Reinforcement Learning (RL)\nwhere an autonomous agent has to balance two contrasting needs in making its\ndecisions is: exploiting the current knowledge of the environment to maximize\nthe cumulative reward as well as exploring actions that allow improving the\nknowledge of the environment, hopefully leading to higher reward values\n(exploration-exploitation trade-off). Concurrently, another relevant issue\nregards the full observability of the states, which may not be assumed in all\napplications. Such as when only 2D images are considered as input in a RL\napproach used for finding the optimal action within a 3D simulation\nenvironment. In this work, we address these issues by deploying and testing\nseveral techniques to balance exploration and exploitation trade-off on\npartially observable systems for predicting steering wheels in autonomous\ndriving scenario. More precisely, the final aim is to investigate the effects\nof using both stochastic and deterministic multi-armed bandit strategies\ncoupled with a Deep Recurrent Q-Network. Additionally, we adapted and evaluated\nthe impact of an innovative method to improve the learning phase of the\nunderlying Convolutional Recurrent Neural Network.

          "description": "Interpretable policy learning seeks to estimate intelligible decision\npolicies from observed actions; however, existing models fall short by forcing\na tradeoff between accuracy and interpretability. This tradeoff limits\ndata-driven interpretations of human decision-making process. e.g. to audit\nmedical decisions for biases and suboptimal practices, we require models of\ndecision processes which provide concise descriptions of complex behaviors.\nFundamentally, existing approaches are burdened by this tradeoff because they\nrepresent the underlying decision process as a universal policy, when in fact\nhuman decisions are dynamic and can change drastically with contextual\ninformation. Thus, we propose Contextualized Policy Recovery (CPR), which\nre-frames the problem of modeling complex decision processes as a multi-task\nlearning problem in which complex decision policies are comprised of\ncontext-specific policies. CPR models each context-specific policy as a linear\nobservation-to-action mapping, and generates new decision models\n$\\textit{on-demand}$ as contexts are updated with new observations. CPR is\ncompatible with fully offline and partially observable decision environments,\nand can be tailored to incorporate any recurrent black-box model or\ninterpretable decision model. We assess CPR through studies on simulated and\nreal data, achieving state-of-the-art performance on the canonical tasks of\npredicting antibiotic prescription in intensive care units ($+22\\%$ AUROC vs.\nprevious SOTA) and predicting MRI prescription for Alzheimer's patients\n($+7.7\\%$ AUROC vs. previous SOTA).

          "description": "Larger and deeper networks generalise well despite their increased capacity\nto overfit. Understanding why this happens is theoretically and practically\nimportant. One recent approach looks at the infinitely wide limits of such\nnetworks and their corresponding kernels. However, these theoretical tools\ncannot fully explain finite networks as the empirical kernel changes\nsignificantly during gradient-descent-based training in contrast to infinite\nnetworks. In this work, we derive an iterative linearised training method as a\nnovel empirical tool to further investigate this distinction, allowing us to\ncontrol for sparse (i.e. infrequent) feature updates and quantify the frequency\nof feature learning needed to achieve comparable performance. We justify\niterative linearisation as an interpolation between a finite analog of the\ninfinite width regime, which does not learn features, and standard gradient\ndescent training, which does. Informally, we also show that it is analogous to\na damped version of the Gauss-Newton algorithm -- a second-order method. We\nshow that in a variety of cases, iterative linearised training surprisingly\nperforms on par with standard training, noting in particular how much less\nfrequent feature learning is required to achieve comparable performance. We\nalso show that feature learning is essential for good performance. Since such\nfeature learning inevitably causes changes in the NTK kernel, we provide direct\nnegative evidence for the NTK theory, which states the NTK kernel remains\nconstant during training.",

It is rigorously known that in two-layer\nfully-connected neural networks under certain conditions, one step of gradient\ndescent on the first layer followed by ridge regression on the second layer can\nlead to feature learning; characterized by the appearance of a separated\nrank-one component -- spike -- in the spectrum of the feature matrix. However,\nwith a constant gradient descent step size, this spike only carries information\nfrom the linear component of the target function and therefore learning\nnon-linear components is impossible. We show that with a learning rate that\ngrows with the sample size, such training in fact introduces multiple rank-one\ncomponents, each corresponding to a specific polynomial feature. We further\nprove that the limiting large-dimensional and large sample training and test\nerrors of the updated neural networks are fully characterized by these spikes.\nBy precisely analyzing the improvement in the loss, we demonstrate that these\nnon-linear features can enhance learning.",

Our approach reveals that several existing SGMs can be\nseen as specific manifestations of our framework.

Thanks\nto the neural network, N$^3$POM offers flexibility while preserving the\ninterpretability of conventional ordinal regression. We establish a sufficient\ncondition under which the predicted conditional cumulative probability locally\nsatisfies the monotonicity constraint over a user-specified region in the\ncovariate space. Additionally, we provide a monotonicity-preserving stochastic\n(MPS) algorithm for effectively training the neural network. We apply N$^3$POM\nto several real-world datasets.",

          "description": "In 1-bit compressed sensing, the aim is to estimate a $k$-sparse unit vector\n$x\\in S^{n-1}$ within an $\\epsilon$ error (in $\\ell_2$) from minimal number of\nlinear measurements that are quantized to just their signs, i.e., from\nmeasurements of the form $y = \\mathrm{Sign}(\\langle a, x\\rangle).$ In this\npaper, we study a noisy version where a fraction of the measurements can be\nflipped, potentially by an adversary. In particular, we analyze the Binary\nIterative Hard Thresholding (BIHT) algorithm, a proximal gradient descent on a\nproperly defined loss function used for 1-bit compressed sensing, in this noisy\nsetting. It is known from recent results that, with\n$\\tilde{O}(\\frac{k}{\\epsilon})$ noiseless measurements, BIHT provides an\nestimate within $\\epsilon$ error. This result is optimal and universal, meaning\none set of measurements work for all sparse vectors. In this paper, we show\nthat BIHT also provides better results than all known methods for the noisy\nsetting. We show that when up to $\\tau$-fraction of the sign measurements are\nincorrect (adversarial error), with the same number of measurements as before,\nBIHT agnostically provides an estimate of $x$ within an\n$\\tilde{O}(\\epsilon+\\tau)$ error, maintaining the universality of measurements.\nThis establishes stability of iterative hard thresholding in the presence of\nmeasurement error. To obtain the result, we use the restricted approximate\ninvertibility of Gaussian matrices, as well as a tight analysis of the\nhigh-dimensional geometry of the adversarially corrupted measurements.",

To understand this phenomenon, many works have aimed to quantify\nthe memorization capacity of a neural network architecture: the largest number\nof points such that the architecture can interpolate any placement of these\npoints with any assignment of labels. For real-world data, however, one\nintuitively expects the presence of a benign structure so that interpolation\nalready occurs at a smaller network size than suggested by memorization\ncapacity. In this paper, we investigate interpolation by adopting an\ninstance-specific viewpoint. We introduce a simple randomized algorithm that,\ngiven a fixed finite dataset with two classes, with high probability constructs\nan interpolating three-layer neural network in polynomial time. The required\nnumber of parameters is linked to geometric properties of the two classes and\ntheir mutual arrangement.

          "description": "Many causal estimands are only partially identifiable since they depend on\nthe unobservable joint distribution between potential outcomes. Stratification\non pretreatment covariates can yield sharper partial identification bounds;\nhowever, unless the covariates are discrete with relatively small support, this\napproach typically requires consistent estimation of the conditional\ndistributions of the potential outcomes given the covariates. Thus, existing\napproaches may fail under model misspecification or if consistency assumptions\nare violated. In this study, we propose a unified and model-agnostic\ninferential approach for a wide class of partially identified estimands, based\non duality theory for optimal transport problems. In randomized experiments,\nour approach can wrap around any estimates of the conditional distributions and\nprovide uniformly valid inference, even if the initial estimates are\narbitrarily inaccurate. Also, our approach is doubly robust in observational\nstudies. Notably, this property allows analysts to use the multiplier bootstrap\nto select covariates and models without sacrificing validity even if the true\nmodel is not included. Furthermore, if the conditional distributions are\nestimated at semiparametric rates, our approach matches the performance of an\noracle with perfect knowledge of the outcome model.

          "description": "The growing interest in machine learning problems over graphs with additional\nnode information such as texts, images, or labels has popularized methods that\nrequire the costly operation of processing the entire graph. Yet, little effort\nhas been made to the development of fast local methods (i.e. without accessing\nthe entire graph) that extract useful information from such data. To that end,\nwe propose a study of local graph clustering using noisy node labels as a proxy\nfor additional node information. In this setting, nodes receive initial binary\nlabels based on cluster affiliation: 1 if they belong to the target cluster and\n0 otherwise. Subsequently, a fraction of these labels is flipped. We\ninvestigate the benefits of incorporating noisy labels for local graph\nclustering. By constructing a weighted graph with such labels, we study the\nperformance of graph diffusion-based local clustering method on both the\noriginal and the weighted graphs. From a theoretical perspective, we consider\nrecovering an unknown target cluster with a single seed node in a random graph\nwith independent noisy node labels. We provide sufficient conditions on the\nlabel noise under which, with high probability, using diffusion in the weighted\ngraph yields a more accurate recovery of the target cluster. This approach\nproves more effective than using the given labels alone or using diffusion in\nthe label-free original graph. Empirically, we show that reliable node labels\ncan be obtained with just a few samples from an attributed graph. Moreover,\nutilizing these labels via diffusion in the weighted graph leads to\nsignificantly better local clustering performance across several real-world\ndatasets, improving F1 scores by up to 13%.",

          "description": "Large language models such as ChatGPT are increasingly explored in medical\ndomains.

We searched ten medical literature databases on\nJune 15, 2023, using the keyword \"ChatGPT\". A total of 3520 articles were\nidentified, of which 60 were reviewed and summarized in this paper and 17 were\nincluded in the meta-analysis. The analysis showed that ChatGPT displayed an\noverall integrated accuracy of 56% (95% CI: 51%-60%, I2 = 87%) in addressing\nmedical queries. However, the studies varied in question resource,\nquestion-asking process, and evaluation metrics. Moreover, many studies failed\nto report methodological details, including the version of ChatGPT and whether\neach question was used independently or repeatedly. Our findings revealed that\nalthough ChatGPT demonstrated considerable potential for application in\nhealthcare, the heterogeneity of the studies and insufficient reporting may\naffect the reliability of these results.

          "description": "Multiple data views measured on the same set of participants is becoming more\ncommon and has the potential to deepen our understanding of many complex\ndiseases by analyzing these different views simultaneously. Equally important,\nmany of these complex diseases show evidence of subgroup heterogeneity (e.g.,\nby sex or race). HIP (Heterogeneity in Integration and Prediction) is among the\nfirst methods proposed to integrate multiple data views while also accounting\nfor subgroup heterogeneity to identify common and subgroup-specific markers of\na particular disease. However, HIP is applicable to continuous outcomes and\nrequires programming expertise by the user.

          "description": "Lion (Evolved Sign Momentum), a new optimizer discovered through program\nsearch, has shown promising results in training large AI models. It performs\ncomparably or favorably to AdamW but with greater memory efficiency. As we can\nexpect from the results of a random search program, Lion incorporates elements\nfrom several existing algorithms, including signed momentum, decoupled weight\ndecay, Polak, and Nesterov momentum, but does not fit into any existing\ncategory of theoretically grounded optimizers. Thus, even though Lion appears\nto perform well as a general-purpose optimizer for a wide range of tasks, its\ntheoretical basis remains uncertain. This lack of theoretical clarity limits\nopportunities to further enhance and expand Lion's efficacy.\n\nThis work aims to demystify Lion. Based on both continuous-time and\ndiscrete-time analysis, we demonstrate that Lion is a theoretically novel and\nprincipled approach for minimizing a general loss function $f(x)$ while\nenforcing a bound constraint $\\|x\\|_\\infty \\leq 1/\\lambda$. Lion achieves this\nthrough the incorporation of decoupled weight decay, where $\\lambda$ represents\nthe weight decay coefficient. Our analysis is made possible by the development\nof a new Lyapunov function for the Lion updates. It applies to a broader family\nof Lion-$\\kappa$ algorithms, where the $\\text{sign}(\\cdot)$ operator in Lion is\nreplaced by the subgradient of a convex function $\\kappa$, leading to the\nsolution of a general composite optimization problem of $\\min_x f(x) +\n\\kappa^*(x)$. Our findings provide valuable insights into the dynamics of Lion\nand pave the way for further improvements and extensions of Lion-related\nalgorithms.",

          "description": "Large transformer models pretrained on offline reinforcement learning\ndatasets have demonstrated remarkable in-context reinforcement learning (ICRL)\ncapabilities, where they can make good decisions when prompted with interaction\ntrajectories from unseen environments. However, when and how transformers can\nbe trained to perform ICRL have not been theoretically well-understood. In\nparticular, it is unclear which reinforcement-learning algorithms transformers\ncan perform in context, and how distribution mismatch in offline training data\naffects the learned algorithms. This paper provides a theoretical framework\nthat analyzes supervised pretraining for ICRL. This includes two recently\nproposed training methods -- algorithm distillation and decision-pretrained\ntransformers. First, assuming model realizability, we prove the\nsupervised-pretrained transformer will imitate the conditional expectation of\nthe expert algorithm given the observed trajectory. The generalization error\nwill scale with model capacity and a distribution divergence factor between the\nexpert and offline algorithms. Second, we show transformers with ReLU attention\ncan efficiently approximate near-optimal online reinforcement learning\nalgorithms like LinUCB and Thompson sampling for stochastic linear bandits, and\nUCB-VI for tabular Markov decision processes. This provides the first\nquantitative analysis of the ICRL capabilities of transformers pretrained from\noffline trajectories.",

          "description": "Many real-world prediction tasks have outcome variables that have\ncharacteristic heavy-tail distributions. Examples include copies of books sold,\nauction prices of art pieces, demand for commodities in warehouses, etc. By\nlearning heavy-tailed distributions, \"big and rare\" instances (e.g., the\nbest-sellers) will have accurate predictions. Most existing approaches are not\ndedicated to learning heavy-tailed distribution; thus, they heavily\nunder-predict such instances. To tackle this problem, we introduce Learning to\nPlace (L2P), which exploits the pairwise relationships between instances for\nlearning. In its training phase, L2P learns a pairwise preference classifier:\nis instance A > instance B? In its placing phase, L2P obtains a prediction by\nplacing the new instance among the known instances. Based on its placement, the\nnew instance is then assigned a value for its outcome variable. Experiments on\nreal data show that L2P outperforms competing approaches in terms of accuracy\nand ability to reproduce heavy-tailed outcome distribution. In addition, L2P\nprovides an interpretable model by placing each predicted instance in relation\nto its comparable neighbors. Interpretable models are highly desirable when\nlives and treasure are at stake.",

          "description": "Across a wide array of disciplines, many researchers use machine learning\n(ML) algorithms to identify a subgroup of individuals, called exceptional\nresponders, who are likely to be helped by a treatment the most. A common\napproach consists of two steps. One first estimates the conditional average\ntreatment effect or its proxy using an ML algorithm. They then determine the\ncutoff of the resulting treatment prioritization score to select those\npredicted to benefit most from the treatment. Unfortunately, these estimated\ntreatment prioritization scores are often biased and noisy. Furthermore,\nutilizing the same data to both choose a cutoff value and estimate the average\ntreatment effect among the selected individuals suffer from a multiple testing\nproblem. To address these challenges, we develop a uniform confidence band for\nexperimentally evaluating the sorted average treatment effect (GATES) among the\nindividuals whose treatment prioritization score is at least as high as any\ngiven quantile value, regardless of how the quantile is chosen. This provides a\nstatistical guarantee that the GATES for the selected subgroup exceeds a\ncertain threshold. The validity of the proposed methodology depends solely on\nrandomization of treatment and random sampling of units without requiring\nmodeling assumptions or resampling methods. This widens its applicability\nincluding a wide range of other causal quantities. A simulation study shows\nthat the empirical coverage of the proposed uniform confidence bands is close\nto the nominal coverage when the sample is as small as 100. We analyze a\nclinical trial of late-stage prostate cancer and find a relatively large\nproportion of exceptional responders with a statistical performance guarantee.",

At the first level, only\nsamples with hard labels are known, via which the maximum likelihood estimator\nattains the minimax rate $\\sqrt{{|{\\mathcal S}||{\\mathcal A}|}/{n}}$. The\nsecond level has the teacher probabilities of sampled labels available in\naddition, which turns out to boost the convergence rate lower bound to\n${{|{\\mathcal S}||{\\mathcal A}|}/{n}}$. However, under this second data\nacquisition protocol, minimizing a naive adaptation of the cross-entropy loss\nresults in an asymptotically biased student. We overcome this limitation and\nachieve the fundamental limit by using a novel empirical variant of the squared\nerror logit loss. The third level further equips the student with the soft\nlabels (complete logits) on ${\\mathcal A}$ given every sampled input, thereby\nprovably enables the student to enjoy a rate ${|{\\mathcal S}|}/{n}$ free of\n$|{\\mathcal A}|$.

When\nhistorical data lacks this, it is desired to model the underlying data\ngeneration mechanism as a probability distribution to assess the data quality\nand generate more data, if needed. Kernel density estimation (KDE) based models\nare popular choices for this task, but they fail to adapt to data regions with\nvarying densities. In this paper, an adaptive KDE model is employed to\ncircumvent this, where each kernel in the model has an individual bandwidth.\nThe leave-one-out maximum log-likelihood (LOO-MLL) criterion is proposed to\nprevent the singular solutions that the regular MLL criterion gives rise to,\nand it is proven that LOO-MLL prevents these. Relying on this guaranteed\nrobustness, the model is extended by assigning learnable weights to the\nkernels. In addition, a modified expectation-maximization algorithm is employed\nto accelerate the optimization speed reliably. The performance of the proposed\nmethod and models are exhibited on two power systems datasets using different\nstatistical tests and by comparison with Gaussian mixture models.

Such an analysis sheds light on the optimal\nchoice of local updates to minimize communication costs.

          "description": "Surrogate models play a crucial role in retrospectively interpreting complex\nand powerful black box machine learning models via model distillation. This\npaper focuses on using model-based trees as surrogate models which partition\nthe feature space into interpretable regions via decision rules. Within each\nregion, interpretable models based on additive main effects are used to\napproximate the behavior of the black box model, striking for an optimal\nbalance between interpretability and performance. Four model-based tree\nalgorithms, namely SLIM, GUIDE, MOB, and CTree, are compared regarding their\nability to generate such surrogate models. We investigate fidelity,\ninterpretability, stability, and the algorithms' capability to capture\ninteraction effects through appropriate splits. Based on our comprehensive\nanalyses, we finally provide an overview of user-specific recommendations.",

The quantity $2/\\eta$ has been called the\n\"edge of stability\" based on consideration of a local quadratic approximation\nof the loss. We perform a similar calculation to arrive at an \"edge of\nstability\" for Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM), a variant of GD which has\nbeen shown to improve its generalization. Unlike the case for GD, the resulting\nSAM-edge depends on the norm of the gradient. Using three deep learning\ntraining tasks, we see empirically that SAM operates on the edge of stability\nidentified by this analysis.",

          "description": "Sparse deep learning has become a popular technique for improving the\nperformance of deep neural networks in areas such as uncertainty\nquantification, variable selection, and large-scale network compression.\nHowever, most existing research has focused on problems where the observations\nare independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.), and there has been little\nwork on the problems where the observations are dependent, such as time series\ndata and sequential data in natural language processing. This paper aims to\naddress this gap by studying the theory for sparse deep learning with dependent\ndata. We show that sparse recurrent neural networks (RNNs) can be consistently\nestimated, and their predictions are asymptotically normally distributed under\nappropriate assumptions, enabling the prediction uncertainty to be correctly\nquantified. Our numerical results show that sparse deep learning outperforms\nstate-of-the-art methods, such as conformal predictions, in prediction\nuncertainty quantification for time series data. Furthermore, our results\nindicate that the proposed method can consistently identify the autoregressive\norder for time series data and outperform existing methods in large-scale model\ncompression. Our proposed method has important practical implications in fields\nsuch as finance, healthcare, and energy, where both accurate point estimates\nand prediction uncertainty quantification are of concern.",

          "description": "Sampling a probability distribution with an unknown normalization constant is\na fundamental problem in computational science and engineering. This task may\nbe cast as an optimization problem over all probability measures, and an\ninitial distribution can be evolved to the desired minimizer dynamically via\ngradient flows. Mean-field models, whose law is governed by the gradient flow\nin the space of probability measures, may also be identified; particle\napproximations of these mean-field models form the basis of algorithms. The\ngradient flow approach is also the basis of algorithms for variational\ninference, in which the optimization is performed over a parameterized family\nof probability distributions such as Gaussians, and the underlying gradient\nflow is restricted to the parameterized family.\n\nBy choosing different energy functionals and metrics for the gradient flow,\ndifferent algorithms with different convergence properties arise. In this\npaper, we concentrate on the Kullback-Leibler divergence after showing that, up\nto scaling, it has the unique property that the gradient flows resulting from\nthis choice of energy do not depend on the normalization constant. For the\nmetrics, we focus on variants of the Fisher-Rao, Wasserstein, and Stein\nmetrics; we introduce the affine invariance property for gradient flows, and\ntheir corresponding mean-field models, determine whether a given metric leads\nto affine invariance, and modify it to make it affine invariant if it does not.\nWe study the resulting gradient flows in both probability density space and\nGaussian space. The flow in the Gaussian space may be understood as a Gaussian\napproximation of the flow. We demonstrate that the Gaussian approximation based\non the metric and through moment closure coincide, establish connections\nbetween them, and study their long-time convergence properties showing the\nadvantages of affine invariance.",

Existing attribution methods aim to provide human-understandable\nexplanations by highlighting important regions in the image domain, but fail to\nfully characterize a decision process's reliability.

          "description": "Measures of power grid vulnerability are often assessed by the amount of\ndamage an adversary can exact on the network. However, the cascading impact of\nsuch attacks is often overlooked, even though cascades are one of the primary\ncauses of large-scale blackouts. This paper explores modifications of\ntransmission line protection settings as candidates for adversarial attacks,\nwhich can remain undetectable as long as the network equilibrium state remains\nunaltered. This forms the basis of a black-box function in a Bayesian\noptimization procedure, where the objective is to find protection settings that\nmaximize network degradation due to cascading. Notably, our proposed method is\nagnostic to the choice of the cascade simulator and its underlying assumptions.\nNumerical experiments reveal that, against conventional wisdom, maximally\nmisconfiguring the protection settings of all network lines does not cause the\nmost cascading. More surprisingly, even when the degree of misconfiguration is\nlimited due to resource constraints, it is still possible to find settings that\nproduce cascades comparable in severity to instances where there are no\nresource constraints.",

          "description": "Multi-fidelity (MF) methods are gaining popularity for enhancing surrogate\nmodeling and design optimization by incorporating data from various\nlow-fidelity (LF) models. While most existing MF methods assume a fixed\ndataset, adaptive sampling methods that dynamically allocate resources among\nfidelity models can achieve higher efficiency in the exploring and exploiting\nthe design space. However, most existing MF methods rely on the hierarchical\nassumption of fidelity levels or fail to capture the intercorrelation between\nmultiple fidelity levels and utilize it to quantify the value of the future\nsamples and navigate the adaptive sampling. To address this hurdle, we propose\na framework hinged on a latent embedding for different fidelity models and the\nassociated pre-posterior analysis to explicitly utilize their correlation for\nadaptive sampling. In this framework, each infill sampling iteration includes\ntwo steps: We first identify the location of interest with the greatest\npotential improvement using the high-fidelity (HF) model, then we search for\nthe next sample across all fidelity levels that maximize the improvement per\nunit cost at the location identified in the first step. This is made possible\nby a single Latent Variable Gaussian Process (LVGP) model that maps different\nfidelity models into an interpretable latent space to capture their\ncorrelations without assuming hierarchical fidelity levels. The LVGP enables us\nto assess how LF sampling candidates will affect HF response with pre-posterior\nanalysis and determine the next sample with the best benefit-to-cost ratio.\nThrough test cases, we demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms the\nbenchmark methods in both MF global fitting (GF) and Bayesian Optimization (BO)\nproblems in convergence rate and robustness. Moreover, the method offers the\nflexibility to switch between GF and BO by simply changing the acquisition\nfunction.",

As a consequence, ensuring equitable outcomes\nrequires fundamentally different algorithmic design principles that ensure\nrobustness to the decision-maker's (a priori unknown) compliance pattern.

In finite-time horizons such\nproblems are relevant for instance for optimal stopping or specific supply\nchain problems, but also in the training of large language models. In contrast\nto infinite horizon MDPs optimal policies are not stationary, policies must be\nlearned for every single epoch. In practice all parameters are often trained\nsimultaneously, ignoring the inherent structure suggested by dynamic\nprogramming. This paper introduces a combination of dynamic programming and\npolicy gradient called dynamic policy gradient, where the parameters are\ntrained backwards in time. For the tabular softmax parametrisation we carry out\nthe convergence analysis for simultaneous and dynamic policy gradient towards\nglobal optima, both in the exact and sampled gradient settings without\nregularisation.

          "description": "Sampling a target probability distribution with an unknown normalization\nconstant is a fundamental challenge in computational science and engineering.\nRecent work shows that algorithms derived by considering gradient flows in the\nspace of probability measures open up new avenues for algorithm development.\nThis paper makes three contributions to this sampling approach by scrutinizing\nthe design components of such gradient flows. Any instantiation of a gradient\nflow for sampling needs an energy functional and a metric to determine the\nflow, as well as numerical approximations of the flow to derive algorithms. Our\nfirst contribution is to show that the Kullback-Leibler divergence, as an\nenergy functional, has the unique property (among all f-divergences) that\ngradient flows resulting from it do not depend on the normalization constant of\nthe target distribution. Our second contribution is to study the choice of\nmetric from the perspective of invariance. The Fisher-Rao metric is known as\nthe unique choice (up to scaling) that is diffeomorphism invariant. As a\ncomputationally tractable alternative, we introduce a relaxed, affine\ninvariance property for the metrics and gradient flows. In particular, we\nconstruct various affine invariant Wasserstein and Stein gradient flows. Affine\ninvariant gradient flows are shown to behave more favorably than their\nnon-affine-invariant counterparts when sampling highly anisotropic\ndistributions, in theory and by using particle methods. Our third contribution\nis to study, and develop efficient algorithms based on Gaussian approximations\nof the gradient flows; this leads to an alternative to particle methods. We\nestablish connections between various Gaussian approximate gradient flows,\ndiscuss their relation to gradient methods arising from parametric variational\ninference, and study their convergence properties both theoretically and\nnumerically.",

While\nprevious work has established that Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs)\nexponentially lose expressive power, it remains controversial whether the graph\nattention mechanism can mitigate oversmoothing. In this work, we provide a\ndefinitive answer to this question through a rigorous mathematical analysis, by\nviewing attention-based GNNs as nonlinear time-varying dynamical systems and\nincorporating tools and techniques from the theory of products of inhomogeneous\nmatrices and the joint spectral radius.

The proposed framework extends the existing\nresults on oversmoothing for symmetric GCNs to a significantly broader class of\nGNN models, including random walk GCNs, Graph Attention Networks (GATs) and\n(graph) transformers.

While there has been extensive research on the applications and\nproperties of kernels, there is relatively little research on kernels induced\nby decision forests. We construct Kernel Mean Embedding Random Forests (KMERF),\nwhich induce kernels from random trees and/or forests using leaf-node\nproximity. We introduce the notion of an asymptotically characteristic kernel,\nand prove that KMERF kernels are asymptotically characteristic for both\ndiscrete and continuous data. Because KMERF is data-adaptive, we suspected it\nwould outperform kernels selected a priori on finite sample data. We illustrate\nthat KMERF nearly dominates current state-of-the-art kernel-based tests across\na diverse range of high-dimensional two-sample and independence testing\nsettings. Furthermore, our forest-based approach is interpretable, and provides\nfeature importance metrics that readily distinguish important dimensions,\nunlike other high-dimensional non-parametric testing procedures.

          "description": "The growing penetration of intermittent, renewable generation in US power\ngrids, especially wind and solar generation, results in increased operational\nuncertainty. In that context, accurate forecasts are critical, especially for\nwind generation, which exhibits large variability and is historically harder to\npredict. To overcome this challenge, this work proposes a novel\nBundle-Predict-Reconcile (BPR) framework that integrates asset bundling,\nmachine learning, and forecast reconciliation techniques. The BPR framework\nfirst learns an intermediate hierarchy level (the bundles), then predicts wind\npower at the asset, bundle, and fleet level, and finally reconciles all\nforecasts to ensure consistency. This approach effectively introduces an\nauxiliary learning task (predicting the bundle-level time series) to help the\nmain learning tasks. The paper also introduces new asset-bundling criteria that\ncapture the spatio-temporal dynamics of wind power time series. Extensive\nnumerical experiments are conducted on an industry-size dataset of 283 wind\nfarms in the MISO footprint. The experiments consider short-term and day-ahead\nforecasts, and evaluates a large variety of forecasting models that include\nweather predictions as covariates. The results demonstrate the benefits of BPR,\nwhich consistently and significantly improves forecast accuracy over baselines,\nespecially at the fleet level.",

More flexible spatial\nextremes models exhibit appealing extremal dependence properties but are often\nexceedingly prohibitive to fit and simulate from in high dimensions. In this\npaper, we develop a new spatial extremes model that has flexible and\nnon-stationary dependence properties, and we integrate it in the\nencoding-decoding structure of a variational autoencoder (XVAE), whose\nparameters are estimated via variational Bayes combined with deep learning. The\nXVAE can be used as a spatio-temporal emulator that characterizes the\ndistribution of potential mechanistic model output states and produces outputs\nthat have the same statistical properties as the inputs, especially in the\ntail. As an aside, our approach also provides a novel way of making fast\ninference with complex extreme-value processes. Through extensive simulation\nstudies, we show that our XVAE is substantially more time-efficient than\ntraditional Bayesian inference while also outperforming many spatial extremes\nmodels with a stationary dependence structure. To further demonstrate the\ncomputational power of the XVAE, we analyze a high-resolution satellite-derived\ndataset of sea surface temperature in the Red Sea, which includes 30 years of\ndaily measurements at 16703 grid cells. We find that the extremal dependence\nstrength is weaker in the interior of Red Sea and it has decreased slightly\nover time.",

We study the use of transport maps that approximately\nnormalize a target distribution as a way to precondition and accelerate the\nconvergence of Langevin dynamics. We show that in continuous time, when a\ntransport map is applied to Langevin dynamics, the result is a Riemannian\nmanifold Langevin dynamics (RMLD) with metric defined by the transport map. We\nalso show that applying a transport map to an irreversibly-perturbed ULA\nresults in a geometry-informed irreversible perturbation (GiIrr) of the\noriginal dynamics. These connections suggest more systematic ways of learning\nmetrics and perturbations, and also yield alternative discretizations of the\nRMLD described by the map, which we study. Under appropriate conditions, these\ndiscretized processes can be endowed with non-asymptotic bounds describing\nconvergence to the target distribution in 2-Wasserstein distance.

          "description": "The standard paired-sample testing approach in the multidimensional setting\napplies multiple univariate tests on the individual features, followed by\np-value adjustments. Such an approach suffers when the data carry numerous\nfeatures. A number of studies have shown that classification accuracy can be\nseen as a proxy for two-sample testing. However, neither theoretical\nfoundations nor practical recipes have been proposed so far on how this\nstrategy could be extended to multidimensional paired-sample testing. In this\nwork, we put forward the idea that scoring functions can be produced by the\ndecision rules defined by the perpendicular bisecting hyperplanes of the line\nsegments connecting each pair of instances. Then, the optimal scoring function\ncan be obtained by the pseudomedian of those rules, which we estimate by\nextending naturally the Hodges-Lehmann estimator. We accordingly propose a\nframework of a two-step testing procedure. First, we estimate the bisecting\nhyperplanes for each pair of instances and an aggregated rule derived through\nthe Hodges-Lehmann estimator. The paired samples are scored by this aggregated\nrule to produce a unidimensional representation. Second, we perform a Wilcoxon\nsigned-rank test on the obtained representation.

          "description": "Graphon estimation has been one of the most fundamental problems in network\nanalysis and has received considerable attention in the past decade. From the\nstatistical perspective, the minimax error rate of graphon estimation has been\nestablished by Gao et al (2015) for both stochastic block model (SBM) and\nnonparametric graphon estimation. The statistical optimal estimators are based\non constrained least squares and have computational complexity exponential in\nthe dimension. From the computational perspective, the best-known\npolynomial-time estimator is based on universal singular value thresholding\n(USVT), but it can only achieve a much slower estimation error rate than the\nminimax one. It is natural to wonder if such a gap is essential. The\ncomputational optimality of the USVT or the existence of a computational\nbarrier in graphon estimation has been a long-standing open problem. In this\nwork, we take the first step towards it and provide rigorous evidence for the\ncomputational barrier in graphon estimation via low-degree polynomials.\nSpecifically, in both SBM and nonparametric graphon estimation, we show that\nfor low-degree polynomial estimators, their estimation error rates cannot be\nsignificantly better than that of the USVT under a wide range of parameter\nregimes. Our results are proved based on the recent development of low-degree\npolynomials by Schramm and Wein (2022), while we overcome a few key challenges\nin applying it to the general graphon estimation problem. By leveraging our\nmain results, we also provide a computational lower bound on the clustering\nerror for community detection in SBM with a growing number of communities and\nthis yields a new piece of evidence for the conjectured Kesten-Stigum threshold\nfor efficient community recovery.",

In this paper, we investigate the research question: Can we train SSL\nmodels without real unlabeled datasets? Instead of using real unlabeled\ndatasets, we propose an SSL method using synthetic datasets generated from\ngenerative foundation models trained on datasets containing millions of samples\nin diverse domains (e.g., ImageNet). Our main concepts are identifying\nsynthetic samples that emulate unlabeled samples from generative foundation\nmodels and training classifiers using these synthetic samples. To achieve this,\nour method is formulated as an alternating optimization problem: (i)\nmeta-learning of generative foundation models and (ii) SSL of classifiers using\nreal labeled and synthetic unlabeled samples. For (i), we propose a\nmeta-learning objective that optimizes latent variables to generate samples\nthat resemble real labeled samples and minimize the validation loss. For (ii),\nwe propose a simple unsupervised loss function that regularizes the feature\nextractors of classifiers to maximize the performance improvement obtained from\nsynthetic samples. We confirm that our method outperforms baselines using\ngenerative foundation models on SSL. We also demonstrate that our methods\noutperform SSL using real unlabeled datasets in scenarios with extremely small\namounts of labeled datasets.

          "description": "Batch reinforcement learning (RL) defines the task of learning from a fixed\nbatch of data lacking exhaustive exploration. Worst-case optimality algorithms,\nwhich calibrate a value-function model class from logged experience and perform\nsome type of pessimistic evaluation under the learned model, have emerged as a\npromising paradigm for batch RL. However, contemporary works on this stream\nhave commonly overlooked the hierarchical decision-making structure hidden in\nthe optimization landscape. In this paper, we adopt a game-theoretical\nviewpoint and model the policy learning diagram as a two-player general-sum\ngame with a leader-follower structure. We propose a novel stochastic\ngradient-based learning algorithm: StackelbergLearner, in which the leader\nplayer updates according to the total derivative of its objective instead of\nthe usual individual gradient, and the follower player makes individual updates\nand ensures transition-consistent pessimistic reasoning. The derived learning\ndynamic naturally lends StackelbergLearner to a game-theoretic interpretation\nand provides a convergence guarantee to differentiable Stackelberg equilibria.\nFrom a theoretical standpoint, we provide instance-dependent regret bounds with\ngeneral function approximation, which shows that our algorithm can learn a\nbest-effort policy that is able to compete against any comparator policy that\nis covered by batch data. Notably, our theoretical regret guarantees only\nrequire realizability without any data coverage and strong function\napproximation conditions, e.g., Bellman closedness, which is in contrast to\nprior works lacking such guarantees. Through comprehensive experiments, we find\nthat our algorithm consistently performs as well or better as compared to\nstate-of-the-art methods in batch RL benchmark and real-world datasets.",

          "description": "Contrastive learning is a self-supervised representation learning framework,\nwhere two positive views generated through data augmentation are made similar\nby an attraction force in a data representation space, while a repulsive force\nmakes them far from negative examples. Non-contrastive learning, represented by\nBYOL and SimSiam, further gets rid of negative examples and improves\ncomputational efficiency. While learned representations may collapse into a\nsingle point due to the lack of the repulsive force at first sight, Tian et al.\n(2021) revealed through the learning dynamics analysis that the representations\ncan avoid collapse if data augmentation is sufficiently stronger than\nregularization. However, their analysis does not take into account\ncommonly-used feature normalization, a normalizer before measuring the\nsimilarity of representations, and hence excessively strong regularization may\ncollapse the dynamics, which is an unnatural behavior under the presence of\nfeature normalization. Therefore, we extend the previous theory based on the L2\nloss by considering the cosine loss, which involves feature normalization. We\nshow that the cosine loss induces sixth-order dynamics (while the L2 loss\ninduces a third-order one), in which a stable equilibrium dynamically emerges\neven if there are only collapsed solutions with given initial parameters. Thus,\nwe offer a new understanding that feature normalization plays an important role\nin robustly preventing the dynamics collapse.",

A recently popular solution consists\nin representing graphs as metric measure spaces, allowing to successfully\nleverage Optimal Transport, which provides meaningful distances allowing to\ncompare them: the Gromov-Wasserstein distances.

Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) has\nemerged as a promising pathway towards AI alignment but brings forth challenges\ndue to its complexity and dependence on a separate reward model. Direct\nPreference Optimization (DPO) has been proposed as an alternative, and it\nremains equivalent to RLHF under the reverse KL regularization constraint. This\npaper presents $f$-DPO, a generalized approach to DPO by incorporating diverse\ndivergence constraints. We show that under certain $f$-divergences, including\nJensen-Shannon divergence, forward KL divergences and $\\alpha$-divergences, the\ncomplex relationship between the reward and optimal policy can also be\nsimplified by addressing the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker conditions. This eliminates the\nneed for estimating the normalizing constant in the Bradley-Terry model and\nenables a tractable mapping between the reward function and the optimal policy.\nOur approach optimizes LLMs to align with human preferences in a more efficient\nand supervised manner under a broad set of divergence constraints. Empirically,\nadopting these divergences ensures a balance between alignment performance and\ngeneration diversity.

          "description": "Variance in predictions across different trained models is a significant,\nunder-explored source of error in fair classification. In practice, the\nvariance on some data examples is so large that decisions can be effectively\narbitrary. To investigate this problem, we take an experimental approach and\nmake four overarching contributions: We 1) Define a metric called\nself-consistency, derived from variance, which we use as a proxy for measuring\nand reducing arbitrariness; 2) Develop an ensembling algorithm that abstains\nfrom classification when a prediction would be arbitrary; 3) Conduct the\nlargest to-date empirical study of the role of variance (vis-a-vis\nself-consistency and arbitrariness) in fair classification; and, 4) Release a\ntoolkit that makes the US Home Mortgage Disclosure Act (HMDA) datasets easily\nusable for future research. Altogether, our experiments reveal shocking\ninsights about the reliability of conclusions on benchmark datasets. Most\nfairness classification benchmarks are close-to-fair when taking into account\nthe amount of arbitrariness present in predictions -- before we even try to\napply common fairness interventions. This finding calls into question the\npractical utility of common algorithmic fairness methods, and in turn suggests\nthat we should fundamentally reconsider how we choose to measure fairness in\nmachine learning.",

          "description": "While reliable data-driven decision-making hinges on high-quality labeled\ndata, the acquisition of quality labels often involves laborious human\nannotations or slow and expensive scientific measurements. Machine learning is\nbecoming an appealing alternative as sophisticated predictive techniques are\nbeing used to quickly and cheaply produce large amounts of predicted labels;\ne.g., predicted protein structures are used to supplement experimentally\nderived structures, predictions of socioeconomic indicators from satellite\nimagery are used to supplement accurate survey data, and so on. Since\npredictions are imperfect and potentially biased, this practice brings into\nquestion the validity of downstream inferences. We introduce cross-prediction:\na method for valid inference powered by machine learning. With a small labeled\ndataset and a large unlabeled dataset, cross-prediction imputes the missing\nlabels via machine learning and applies a form of debiasing to remedy the\nprediction inaccuracies. The resulting inferences achieve the desired error\nprobability and are more powerful than those that only leverage the labeled\ndata. Closely related is the recent proposal of prediction-powered inference,\nwhich assumes that a good pre-trained model is already available. We show that\ncross-prediction is consistently more powerful than an adaptation of\nprediction-powered inference in which a fraction of the labeled data is split\noff and used to train the model. Finally, we observe that cross-prediction\ngives more stable conclusions than its competitors; its confidence intervals\ntypically have significantly lower variability.",

          "description": "We study differentially private (DP) stochastic optimization (SO) with loss\nfunctions whose worst-case Lipschitz parameter over all data points may be\nextremely large. To date, the vast majority of work on DP SO assumes that the\nloss is uniformly Lipschitz continuous over data (i.e. stochastic gradients are\nuniformly bounded over all data points). While this assumption is convenient,\nit often leads to pessimistic excess risk bounds. In many practical problems,\nthe worst-case (uniform) Lipschitz parameter of the loss over all data points\nmay be extremely large due to outliers. In such cases, the error bounds for DP\nSO, which scale with the worst-case Lipschitz parameter of the loss, are\nvacuous. To address these limitations, this work provides near-optimal excess\nrisk bounds that do not depend on the uniform Lipschitz parameter of the loss.\nBuilding on a recent line of work (Wang et al., 2020; Kamath et al., 2022), we\nassume that stochastic gradients have bounded $k$-th order moments for some $k\n\\geq 2$. Compared with works on uniformly Lipschitz DP SO, our excess risk\nscales with the $k$-th moment bound instead of the uniform Lipschitz parameter\nof the loss, allowing for significantly faster rates in the presence of\noutliers and/or heavy-tailed data. For convex and strongly convex loss\nfunctions, we provide the first asymptotically optimal excess risk bounds (up\nto a logarithmic factor). In contrast to (Wang et al., 2020; Kamath et al.,\n2022), our bounds do not require the loss function to be differentiable/smooth.\nWe also devise a linear-time algorithm for smooth losses that has excess risk\nthat is tight in certain practical parameter regimes. Additionally, our work is\nthe first to address non-convex non-uniformly Lipschitz loss functions\nsatisfying the Proximal-PL inequality; this covers some practical machine\nlearning models. Our Proximal-PL algorithm has near-optimal excess risk.",

Similar to the classical setup, the agent\nreceives rewards generated independently from the distribution of the arm\nchosen at each time. However, these rewards are not directly observed. Instead,\nwith a fixed $\\varepsilon\\in (0,\\frac{1}{2})$, the agent observes a sample from\nthe chosen arm's distribution with probability $1-\\varepsilon$, or from an\narbitrary corruption distribution with probability $\\varepsilon$. Importantly,\nwe impose no assumptions on these corruption distributions, which can be\nunbounded. In this setting, accommodating potentially unbounded corruptions, we\nestablish a problem-dependent lower bound on regret for a given family of arm\ndistributions. We introduce CRIMED, an asymptotically-optimal algorithm that\nachieves the exact lower bound on regret for bandits with Gaussian\ndistributions with known variance. Additionally, we provide a finite-sample\nanalysis of CRIMED's regret performance. Notably, CRIMED can effectively handle\ncorruptions with $\\varepsilon$ values as high as $\\frac{1}{2}$. Furthermore, we\ndevelop a tight concentration result for medians in the presence of arbitrary\ncorruptions, even with $\\varepsilon$ values up to $\\frac{1}{2}$, which may be\nof independent interest.

          "description": "Recently, studies on machine learning have focused on methods that use\nsymmetry implicit in a specific manifold as an inductive bias. Grassmann\nmanifolds provide the ability to handle fundamental shapes represented as shape\nspaces, enabling stable shape analysis. In this paper, we present a novel\napproach in which we establish the theoretical foundations for learning\ndistributions on the Grassmann manifold via continuous normalization flows,\nwith the explicit goal of generating stable shapes. Our approach facilitates\nmore robust generation by effectively eliminating the influence of extraneous\ntransformations, such as rotations and inversions, through learning and\ngenerating within a Grassmann manifolds designed to accommodate the essential\nshape information of the object. The experimental results indicated that the\nproposed method can generate high-quality samples by capturing the data\nstructure. Furthermore, the proposed method significantly outperformed\nstate-of-the-art methods in terms of the log-likelihood or evidence lower\nbound. The results obtained are expected to stimulate further research in this\nfield, leading to advances for stable shape generation and analysis.",

          "description": "Sequential change detection is a classical problem with a variety of\napplications. However, the majority of prior work has been parametric, for\nexample, focusing on exponential families. We develop a fundamentally new and\ngeneral framework for sequential change detection when the pre- and post-change\ndistributions are nonparametrically specified (and thus composite). Our\nprocedures come with clean, nonasymptotic bounds on the average run length\n(frequency of false alarms). In certain nonparametric cases (like sub-Gaussian\nor sub-exponential), we also provide near-optimal bounds on the detection delay\nfollowing a changepoint. The primary technical tool that we introduce is called\nan \\emph{e-detector}, which is composed of sums of e-processes -- a fundamental\ngeneralization of nonnegative supermartingales -- that are started at\nconsecutive times. We first introduce simple Shiryaev-Roberts and CUSUM-style\ne-detectors, and then show how to design their mixtures in order to achieve\nboth statistical and computational efficiency. Our e-detector framework can be\ninstantiated to recover classical likelihood-based procedures for parametric\nproblems, as well as yielding the first change detection method for many\nnonparametric problems. As a running example, we tackle the problem of\ndetecting changes in the mean of a bounded random variable without i.i.d.\nassumptions, with an application to tracking the performance of a basketball\nteam over multiple seasons.",

          "description": "Recent years have seen significant activity on the problem of using data for\nthe purpose of learning properties of quantum systems or of processing\nclassical or quantum data via quantum computing. As in classical learning,\nquantum learning problems involve settings in which the mechanism generating\nthe data is unknown, and the main goal of a learning algorithm is to ensure\nsatisfactory accuracy levels when only given access to data and, possibly, side\ninformation such as expert knowledge. This article reviews the complexity of\nquantum learning using information-theoretic techniques by focusing on data\ncomplexity, copy complexity, and model complexity. Copy complexity arises from\nthe destructive nature of quantum measurements, which irreversibly alter the\nstate to be processed, limiting the information that can be extracted about\nquantum data. For example, in a quantum system, unlike in classical machine\nlearning, it is generally not possible to evaluate the training loss\nsimultaneously on multiple hypotheses using the same quantum data. To make the\npaper self-contained and approachable by different research communities, we\nprovide extensive background material on classical results from statistical\nlearning theory, as well as on the distinguishability of quantum states.\nThroughout, we highlight the differences between quantum and classical learning\nby addressing both supervised and unsupervised learning, and we provide\nextensive pointers to the literature.",

          "description": "Structure learning is the crux of causal inference. Notably, causal discovery\n(CD) algorithms are brittle when data is scarce, possibly inferring imprecise\ncausal relations that contradict expert knowledge -- especially when\nconsidering latent confounders. To aggravate the issue, most CD methods do not\nprovide uncertainty estimates, making it hard for users to interpret results\nand improve the inference process. Surprisingly, while CD is a human-centered\naffair, no works have focused on building methods that both 1) output\nuncertainty estimates that can be verified by experts and 2) interact with\nthose experts to iteratively refine CD. To solve these issues, we start by\nproposing to sample (causal) ancestral graphs proportionally to a belief\ndistribution based on a score function, such as the Bayesian information\ncriterion (BIC), using generative flow networks. Then, we leverage the\ndiversity in candidate graphs and introduce an optimal experimental design to\niteratively probe the expert about the relations among variables, effectively\nreducing the uncertainty of our belief over ancestral graphs. Finally, we\nupdate our samples to incorporate human feedback via importance sampling.\nImportantly, our method does not require causal sufficiency (i.e., unobserved\nconfounders may exist).

Bayesian sparsification for deep learning emerges as a crucial\napproach, facilitating the design of models that are both computationally\nefficient and competitive in terms of performance across various deep learning\napplications. The state-of-the-art -- in Bayesian sparsification of deep neural\nnetworks -- combines structural shrinkage priors on model weights with an\napproximate inference scheme based on black-box stochastic variational\ninference. However, model inversion of the full generative model is\nexceptionally computationally demanding, especially when compared to standard\ndeep learning of point estimates. In this context, we advocate for the use of\nBayesian model reduction (BMR) as a more efficient alternative for pruning of\nmodel weights. As a generalization of the Savage-Dickey ratio, BMR allows a\npost-hoc elimination of redundant model weights based on the posterior\nestimates under a straightforward (non-hierarchical) generative model. Our\ncomparative study highlights the computational efficiency and the pruning rate\nof the BMR method relative to the established stochastic variational inference\n(SVI) scheme, when applied to the full hierarchical generative model.

          "description": "Monte Carlo (MC) approximation has been used as the standard computation\napproach for the Sliced Wasserstein (SW) distance, which has an intractable\nexpectation in its analytical form. However, the MC method is not optimal in\nterms of minimizing the absolute approximation error. To provide a better class\nof empirical SW, we propose quasi-sliced Wasserstein (QSW) approximations that\nrely on Quasi-Monte Carlo (QMC) methods. For a comprehensive investigation of\nQMC for SW, we focus on the 3D setting, specifically computing the SW between\nprobability measures in three dimensions. In greater detail, we empirically\nverify various ways of constructing QMC points sets on the 3D unit-hypersphere,\nincluding Gaussian-based mapping, equal area mapping, generalized spiral\npoints, and optimizing discrepancy energies. Furthermore, to obtain an unbiased\nestimation for stochastic optimization, we extend QSW into Randomized\nQuasi-Sliced Wasserstein (RQSW) by introducing randomness to the discussed\nlow-discrepancy sequences. For theoretical properties, we prove the asymptotic\nconvergence of QSW and the unbiasedness of RQSW. Finally, we conduct\nexperiments on various 3D tasks, such as point-cloud comparison, point-cloud\ninterpolation, image style transfer, and training deep point-cloud\nautoencoders, to demonstrate the favorable performance of the proposed QSW and\nRQSW variants.",

          "description": "Modern deep networks are trained with stochastic gradient descent (SGD) whose\nkey parameters are the number of data considered at each step or batch size\n$B$, and the step size or learning rate $\\eta$. For small $B$ and large $\\eta$,\nSGD corresponds to a stochastic evolution of the parameters, whose noise\namplitude is governed by the `temperature' $T\\equiv \\eta/B$. Yet this\ndescription is observed to break down for sufficiently large batches $B\\geq\nB^*$, or simplifies to gradient descent (GD) when the temperature is\nsufficiently small. Understanding where these cross-overs take place remains a\ncentral challenge. Here we resolve these questions for a teacher-student\nperceptron classification model, and show empirically that our key predictions\nstill apply to deep networks. Specifically, we obtain a phase diagram in the\n$B$-$\\eta$ plane that separates three dynamical phases: $\\textit{(i)}$ a\nnoise-dominated SGD governed by temperature, $\\textit{(ii)}$ a\nlarge-first-step-dominated SGD and $\\textit{(iii)}$ GD. These different phases\nalso corresponds to different regimes of generalization error. Remarkably, our\nanalysis reveals that the batch size $B^*$ separating regimes $\\textit{(i)}$\nand $\\textit{(ii)}$ scale with the size $P$ of the training set, with an\nexponent that characterizes the hardness of the classification problem.",

          "description": "Generalized Additive Models (GAMs) are widely used explainable-by-design\nmodels in various applications. GAMs assume that the output can be represented\nas a sum of univariate functions, referred to as components. However, this\nassumption fails in ML problems where the output depends on multiple features\nsimultaneously. In these cases, GAMs fail to capture the interaction terms of\nthe underlying function, leading to subpar accuracy. To (partially) address\nthis issue, we propose Regionally Additive Models (RAMs), a novel class of\nexplainable-by-design models. RAMs identify subregions within the feature space\nwhere interactions are minimized. Within these regions, it is more accurate to\nexpress the output as a sum of univariate functions (components). Consequently,\nRAMs fit one component per subregion of each feature instead of one component\nper feature. This approach yields a more expressive model compared to GAMs\nwhile retaining interpretability. The RAM framework consists of three steps.\nFirstly, we train a black-box model. Secondly, using Regional Effect Plots, we\nidentify subregions where the black-box model exhibits near-local additivity.\nLastly, we fit a GAM component for each identified subregion. We validate the\neffectiveness of RAMs through experiments on both synthetic and real-world\ndatasets. The results confirm that RAMs offer improved expressiveness compared\nto GAMs while maintaining interpretability.",

We propose XVAL, a numerical encoding scheme that represents any real number using just a single token. XVAL represents a given real number by scaling a dedicated embedding vector by the number value. Combined with a modified number-inference approach, this strategy renders the model end-to-end continuous when considered as a map from the numbers of the input string to those of the output string. This leads to an inductive bias that is generally more suitable for applications in scientific domains. We empirically evaluate our proposal on a number of synthetic and real-world datasets. Compared with existing number encoding schemes, we find that XVAL is more token-efficient and demonstrates improved generalization.\n  \nhttps://preview.redd.it/qq8u066smzub1.jpg?width=1344&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=498be8488c00147f0a7443050519dcf535fae126\n https://preview.redd.it/dxqd4wpsmzub1.jpg?width=1499&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=266689a80b31cb31fdc4167043f7abdb4f683100\n https://preview.redd.it/0yy93xpsmzub1.jpg?width=1497&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b5eae8b958f03afc3c8c85a95c115e48aed1d06e\n    submitted by    /u/Singularian2501  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hi r/MachineLearning! I recently went into the CUDA programming rabbit hole. In the process, I came across matrix multiplication and was amazed by how complicated the algorithm is in CUDA (especially if you want to get the best performance). I found the learning process quite gruelling (the CUDA docs were very average), so I wrote a tiny blog which hopefully helps anyone in the same position.\n You can read the blog on Medium (no paywall) or HackMD. It would probably be quite useful if you want to get a deeper intuition of how things like OpenAI Triton or FlashAttention work under the hood.\n Accompanying this is an implementation of a 3-hidden-layer MLP trained on MNIST in pure CUDA. Benchmarking this against PyTorch, it gets up 6x higher end-to-end training speed for small (h=128) networks, and asymptotically 20% faster for large (h=8192) ones! \n https://preview.redd.it/txx2txbvlzub1.png?width=2400&format=png&auto=webp&s=7bb136b9fb535bc58fd7ee809bbbca6f68dc8953\n It's worth noting that I tried reasonably hard optimising the PyTorch implementation by using full fp16, torch.compile with fullgraph=True, mode=\"max-autotune\", and pre-loading all data to GPU up-front (I also did this for the CUDA implementation).\n The main takeaways I got are:\n  \nFor small networks, PyTorch/Python still incurs a significant overhead, even if you try pretty hard to optimise it.\n For large networks, most of the speedup comes from using fp16 accumulation for matrix multiplication (instead of PyTorch's fp32). This obviously reduces stability, but at least in my case, I didn't observe any numerical issues. In cases where we can get away with fp16, we might be leaving a significant amount of performance on the table!\n Anecdotally, you have to try really hard in CUDA to even get close to the performance of PyTorch, but it is possible to beat it if you try hard (suffer) enough.\n  \nYou can check out the repo here: https://github.com/andylolu2/cuda-mnist.

We were told as a \"hint\" to recall Cover's Theorem when separation fails, but the issue is she also wants us to draw a rough sketch of the data with the separator. Mine failed in a basic scatterplot so I upped the dimension by 1 but it also wasn't separable in R3 (which is annoying to draw anyway but could have been done), if I keep going then it might work at some point but idk how I'm meant to draw the data if it's separated in R4 or beyond. If it works in R4 do I just sketch the data in R3 and just draw a 3 dimensional point where w = 0? But even then if it goes beyond R4 it becomes way more annoying.

          "description": "In the past nine years of my deep learning journey, I have come across a vast number of frameworks. Lua Torch was a fantastic framework that initially died due to a lack of Python's ecosystem, but then rose again as PyTorch. Theano was also a great framework, but its major drawback was difficult debugging. I remember spending two weeks writing a Neural Turing Machine for solving bAbI tasks on theano. (Nowadays, it would take a couple hours on Pytorch). Tensorflow - I still don't understand what that was, a terrible framework. There was also Caffe, which was popular in computer vision. Julia is another language that attempted to introduce automatic differentiation as a built-in feature. And JAX, which I was originally biased against since it's a Google product. But some close friends persuaded me to try it, and I actually liked it. However, I thought that it would be difficult for JAX to gain widespread adoption in the community, as PyTorch already had a strong network effect and was gaining traction quickly. I didn't see how anyone could catch up with PyTorch. Another issue with JAX is that it requires additional cognitive load for developers.\n Take a look: https://higgsfield.substack.com/p/how-to-design-api-of-machine-learning\n    submitted by    /u/Good-Willingness-985  \n [link]   [comments]",

However, everybody is building their own contextual data sets and embedding them in their own silo'd vector dbs. \n Do you guys think there's any utility in having a shared public vector db that anyone can tap into their API, without having to self-host, worry about the embedding pipelines and filling the vector db with enough data in the first place for their use cases? Would this save devs alot of time in quickly testing testing product ideas? (albeit it does seem that propriety data is what everyone's raving about today) \n - \n For context, I'm building a social media product we're users can upload a few pieces (approx 10) of content (social media posts, websites, videos to start with), which becomes the verified human-curated list/Niche. We then classify and embed this into a vector db. From this, we have set up a data pipeline to scrape the web and find new content that is most similar which we suggest to users to add to the Niche (upvote, downvote style). When a piece of content is upvoted on its added to the verified list updating the Niche's classification string. Essentially we're aiming to construct an ever-growing, user-curated, contextually classified vector database from a relatively small set of sample data. \n    submitted by    /u/niksteel123  \n [link]   [comments]",

There are many RAG implementations out there, but I've noticed a lack of focus on improving chunking performance specifically.\n Are there any other promising approaches beyond my current pipeline, which consists of a bi-encoder (retriever), cross-encoder (reranker), and a Large Language Model (LLM) for interactions?\n For queries, I'm using both traditional and HyDE (Hypothetical Document Embedding) approaches in the retrieval phase, and sending the top 'n' results of both similarity search to the reranker.\n I've also tried using an LLM to convert the query into a series of 10-20 small phrases or keywords, which are then used as the query for the retriever model. However, the results vary depending on the LLM used. To generate good keywords (with a not extractive approach) , I had to use a \"CoT\" prompt, instructing the model to write self-instruct, problem analysis and reasonings before generating the required keywords. But this approach use lots of tokens, and requires careful scraping to ensure the model has used the right delimiter to separate reasoning and the actual answer.\n I'm also planning to modify the text used to generate embeddings, while returning the original text after the recall phase. But this is still a work in progress and scaling it is proving to be a challenge. If anyone has any tips or experience with this, I'd appreciate your input.\n I'd be grateful for any resources, repositories, libraries, or existing implementations of novel chunking methods that you could share.

          "description": "Tables pack tons of relational data but are tough for AI to grasp. They have complex 2D structure with information scattered across rows and columns. Models like GPT-3 fail basic tasks like finding where a missing value should go.\n LLMs struggle at this because they're pre-trained mostly on natural text, which is linear. Researchers at Microsoft wanted to mitigate this with \"table-tuned\" models, trained on table-related tasks.\n Their process:\n  \nAutomatically generate lots of diverse table-task training cases from a corpus of real-world tables. Ex: \"impute missing value\" or \"identify error in table\".\n Further augment data via paraphrasing, shuffling table rows/columns, chaining model responses, etc.\n  \nThis table-tuning produced \"Table-GPT\" models with substantially stronger table skills. In experiments, Table-GPT crushed vanilla GPT-3:\n  \n25%+ better on unseen table tasks like missing value ID and column type ID\n Beat GPT-3 on 98% of test cases across 9 different table tasks\n Stayed superior after downstream tuning too\n  \nThere's tons more work to do but seems pretty promising. Table-tuning boosted models' ability to comprehend tables and reason over tabular data vs just pre-training on text.\n TLDR: Training AI models more on synthesized table tasks (\"table-tuning\") significantly improves their table skills.\n Full summary is here.

Given a set of text files, my goal is to retrieve the most relevant information related to the query.\n To achieve this, I begin by preprocessing the PDF files, splitting them into pages, and computing embeddings using a fine-tuned BERT model for Italian.\n Next, with a query and its embedding, I calculate the cosine similarity to all the pages in the document. Since there aren't many pages, a brute search remains quite fast.\n However, I'm encountering an issue where the similarity results don't consistently yield the most relevant information. I've experimented with various embedding layers, but there's been little to no improvement.\n I've also tested a commercially available solution to ensure the problem isn't with my PDF files.

          "description": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.02226.pdf\n Abstract\n Language models generate responses by producing a series of tokens in immediate succession: the (K+1)th token is an outcome of manipulating K hidden vectors per layer, one vector per preceding token. What if instead we were to let the model manipulate say, K+10 hidden vectors, before it outputs the (K+1)th token? We operationalize this idea by performing training and inference on language models with a (learnable) pause token, a sequence of which is appended to the input prefix. We then delay extracting the model's outputs until the last pause token is seen, thereby allowing the model to process extra computation before committing to an answer. We empirically evaluate pause-training on decoder-only models of 1B and 130M parameters with causal pretraining on C4, and on downstream tasks covering reasoning, question-answering, general understanding and fact recall. Our main finding is that inference-time delays show gains when the model is both pre-trained and finetuned with delays. For the 1B model, we witness gains on 8 of 9 tasks, most prominently, a gain of 18% EM score on the QA task of SQuAD, 8% on CommonSenseQA and 1% accuracy on the reasoning task of GSM8k. Our work raises a range of conceptual and practical future research questions on making delayed next-token prediction a widely applicable new paradigm.\n Here is a Medium post about my thoughts on the paper.\n    submitted by    /u/transformer_ML  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Game dev is super complex nowadays - games have huge codebases, massive teams, and dev cycles dragging on for years. Costs are insane too - budgets can hit $100M+ easily.\n In a new paper, researchers propose to reverse this trend with an AI framework called GameGPT that automates parts of the dev process using multiple AI agents. Each agent handles a different role (all are fine-tuned from relevant base models):\n  \nOne agent reviews the game design plan to catch errors\n Another turns tasks into code implementations\n Reviewer agents check the code and results\n A testing agent validates everything works as expected\n  \nBy breaking up the workflow, GameGPT can simplify things for the AI agents. They just focus on a narrow role versus having one jack-of-all-trades agent.\n The authors argue GameGPT can eliminate repetitive and rote elements of gamedev like testing. This would free up developers to focus on creative design challenges.\n However, the GameGPT paper does not include any concrete results or experiments demonstrating improved performance. There is no evidence presented that GameGPT reduces hallucinations, redundancy or development time. The authors mention empirical results support their claims that the architecture is more effective, but none are provided. I could not find any additional support material about this work, like a project website, that I could use to further check into this (maybe someone can share in the comments?).\n Right now GameGPT seems mostly conceptual. The ideas are interesting but hard to assess without quantitative results.\n TLDR: New GameGPT AI framework aims to automate tedious parts of game development using specialized agents. No concrete results were provided in the paper - someone will need to test this out and report back.\n Full summary here.

          "description": "Fine-tuning large language models with the aim of obtaining a small but accurate model is extremely difficult.\n This is because you have to strike a balance between the model’s size and accuracy. Researchers from IST Austria & Neural Magic seem to have found a sweet spot. \n In their latest paper, they successfully applied sparse fine-tuning on MPT with remarkable performance. The MPT model was pruned to 75% without a drop in accuracy, showing performance that is on-par with quantization approaches. \n Particularly, the resulting sparse model can execute fast on CPUs by taking advantage of the sparsity. \n Instead of performing standard loss-based fine-tuning which may fail to recover accuracy, the researchers experiment with distillation-type losses. These losses are better at recovering accuracy at high sparsity. What’s impressive is that the sparse fine-tune LLM can achieve 7.7 tokens per second on a single core and 26.7 tokens per second on 4 cores of an cheap consumer AMD Ryzen CPU. The MPT-7B model was fine-tuned via SFT obtaining a dense baseline that showed remarkable performance. This baseline was later pruned with SparseGPT to 40% to 80% reaching 5X compression ratios. By applying SquareHead KD, FP32 models with 75% can be obtained with NO accuracy loss, outperforming cross-entropy and other KD methods. \n The paper is available on Arxiv.

This paper introduces the Autonomous Cognitive Entity (ACE) model, a novel framework for a cognitive architecture, enabling machines and software agents to operate more independently. Drawing inspiration from the OSI model, the ACE framework presents layers of abstraction to conceptualize artificial cognitive architectures. The model is designed to harness the capabilities of the latest generative AI technologies, including large language models (LLMs) and multimodal generative models (MMMs), to build autonomous, agentic systems. The ACE framework comprises six layers: the Aspirational Layer, Global Strategy, Agent Model, Executive Function, Cognitive Control, and Task Prosecution. Each layer plays a distinct role, ranging from setting the moral compass and strategic thinking to task selection and execution. The ACE framework also incorporates mechanisms for handling failures and adapting actions, thereby enhancing the robustness and flexibility of autonomous agents. This paper introduces the conceptual framework and proposes implementation strategies that have been tested and observed in industry. The goal of this paper is to formalize this framework so as to be more accessible.\n  \n​\n https://preview.redd.it/7scnwk5a5dub1.png?width=850&format=png&auto=webp&s=371b5b02a453dcad3e70a2600cc2d625eda44133\n ​\n    submitted by    /u/Prior-Travel3670  \n [link]   [comments]",

If so, could you please provide tips for making my code more efficient?\n Here's the notebook showcasing a pre-made model from MONAI and two of my self-made models:\n https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1VRrdnzaAbp25_DtaWTKHW5JxzyhmueMC?usp=sharing \n \nI've also listed some of my observation on the models and their results in the notebook. Any ideas or suggestion would be much appreciated.\n \n    submitted by    /u/mimivirus2  \n [link]   [comments]",

Furthermore, when seamlessly integrated into an embodied agent, it signifies a crucial stride towards the creation of autonomous and context-aware systems capable of formulating plans and executing commands with precision. In this paper, we introduce Octopus, a novel VLM designed to proficiently decipher an agent's vision and textual task objectives and to formulate intricate action sequences and generate executable code. Our design allows the agent to adeptly handle a wide spectrum of tasks, ranging from mundane daily chores in simulators to sophisticated interactions in complex video games. Octopus is trained by leveraging GPT-4 to control an explorative agent to generate training data, i.e., action blueprints and the corresponding executable code, within our experimental environment called OctoVerse. We also collect the feedback that allows the enhanced training scheme of Reinforcement Learning with Environmental Feedback (RLEF). Through a series of experiments, we illuminate Octopus's functionality and present compelling results, and the proposed RLEF turns out to refine the agent's decision-making. By open-sourcing our model architecture, simulator, and dataset, we aspire to ignite further innovation and foster collaborative applications within the broader embodied AI community. \n  \nhttps://preview.redd.it/1zn9q3g7a8ub1.jpg?width=1651&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=3b14f862b24784918d6b4514bf575cf29bc65edf\n https://preview.redd.it/sv2y06g7a8ub1.jpg?width=1079&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=be9ab7dd7cf23018b6d1fa0c584ad301b04c8abf\n https://preview.redd.it/350xc6g7a8ub1.jpg?width=942&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=53e57541d35ca23d06b8c5be71c2b0c1910fdf90\n ​\n    submitted by    /u/Singularian2501  \n [link]   [comments]",

Moreover, it provides an engineer's insights into the architecture behind these autonomous agents. \n  \nNaturally suitable for AI agent: LLMs feature a natural language interface tailored for user-computer interactions and they come equipped with innate reasoning abilities.\n \nLLM's Deficiency: Despite its strengths, GPT-4 can provide incorrect answers or hallucinations for complex tasks.\n \nChallenges with Training: Finetuning pretrained LLMs doesn't enhance reasoning capabilities. While creating a larger LLM can bolster its problem-solving skills, the process can span several months to a year, potentially leading to a two-year wait before its official launch.\n \nClosed Model and RAG: LLMs, once trained, are unable to fetch real-time data and have inherent shortcomings. However, for Q&A tasks, leveraging an open-book method proves more effective.

          "description": "Hi there, I'm new to Reinforcement Learning (RL), and the papers I've come across mainly focus on scenarios where states change with choices in a game. \n However, I'm interested in finding the best RL algorithm for a simpler case. I have an input I and a policy P. P outputs probabilities for available choices (a limited set of integers), and a reward r is given for each choice (the reward is costly to compute that’s why I use RL). The goal is to train P to maximize the reward.\n So as if we are in a game that ends after only one choice. Any recommendations for the best RL algorithm in this case?\n Thanks!\n    submitted by    /u/Meddhouib10  \n [link]   [comments]",

The ultimate goal is to automatically extract particular information from these newly digital documents, namely \"date\", \"insurance premium\", \"insurance type\", and \"contractor's name\". However, I anticipate a level of variability in terms of exact terminology used, particularly with regards to \"insurance premium\" and \"insurance type\". (There is no handwritten text)\n ​\n I am keen on sharing the methodology I intend to apply for this project and invite your invaluable feedback and suggestions:\n ​\n - Firstly, I'll execute the scanning/digitalization of the documents manually.\n - Post this, I plan to utilize Tesseract in combination with Python for the extraction of text from the preprocessed images.\n - I am considering using libraries such as NLTK or spaCy to preprocess this text (this will involve steps like lower casing, removing punctuations, etc.)\n - Finally, I plan to train a custom model for Named Entity Recognition (NER), to accommodate the potential semantic variations in entity labeling which are specific to entities like \"insurance premium\" and \"insurance type\".\n ​\n I would be immensely grateful if I could gain your insights on the above-proposed pipeline - Are there any glaring pitfalls I need to avoid or perhaps some improvements that I could incorporate?

          "description": "Hi all, \n I’m studying the concepts of machine learning. However, I am stuck because I still don’t see how introducing a penalty using lasso regression can drive some parameter coefficients to zero. When doing the calculations, I only get the final value (ordinary least squares + penalty) and don’t directly see a coefficient value being reduced. \n I've looked at many materials and resources trying to explain this, but I still can't see how it's done. I think the important thing for me is seeing it going to zero or, at the very least, seeing it during calculation. Is there anyone that can help explain this better? Or, If you know of a formula that I can derive that, during the derivation process, shows a coefficient being reduced or set to zero, that would also help.\n Also, any good resources on the topic would be appreciated.\n Edit:\n This post should have been posted in r/learnmachinelearning\n here is a link to the same post in that subreddit\n    submitted by    /u/thismymind  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Today's conversational bots like Claude and GPT can chat impressively but aren't great at complex planning or executing technical tasks. To overcome this, new research from HKU builds open-source AI agents that blend natural language and coding skills. They're called Lemur and Lemur-Chat.\n The researchers think achieving versatile real-world agents requires models that integrate both fluid natural language abilities and precise programming language control. Humans combine plain speech for higher-level goals with languages like Python when we need to plan intricately and execute exactly. AI needs both capacities too.\n But most existing models specialize in pure language or pure code. There's a separation that is limiting.\n The team created Lemur by pretraining the open-source Llama-2 on a massive mixed corpus with 10x more natural language than code. This improved its programming abilities while retaining conversational strength. Further instruction tuning optimized Lemur-Chat for following free-form directions in language.\n Experiments found Lemur surpassed specialized coding-only models like Codex in overall benchmarks. Lemur-Chat then exceeded Lemur by 15% after instruction tuning.\n More importantly, Lemur-Chat won 12/13 new \"agent tests\" designed to mimic real-world challenges needing both language and programming prowess.\n It beat alternatives at:\n  \nUsing tools like Python and Wikipedia to enhance reasoning\n Debugging code by leveraging error messages\n Improving the most from natural language feedback\n Exploring partially observable environments like cybersecurity and web browsing simulations.\n  \nLemur-Chat matched GPT-3.5 in many tests, closing the gap between commercial and open-source agents.\n TLDR: New open-source AI agents combine coding and language skills. Experiments show the combo unlocks more performance across technical challenges.\n Full summary is here. Paper is here.\n    submitted by    /u/Successful-Western27  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hi everyone.\n I am aware that there is a plethora of deep generative models out there (e.g. variational autoencoders (VAE), GANs) that can model high-dimensional data as the images of latent variables under a non-linear mapping (typically neural network).\n In more traditional methods such as probabilistic PCA, the latent variables can be marginalised analytically. In Bayesian PCA (BPCA), we can additionally integrate out the linear mapping, from the latent space to the observation space, by adopting the variational lower bound that leads to closed form updates of the parameters. The Gaussian Process Latent Variable (GPLVM) model adopts a non-linear probabilistic mapping (a Gaussian process) that can be marginalised. These two models enjoy to a certain degree analytical solutions concerning the inference of the latent variables and the mapping.\n I have been wondering whether there is any research into more \"complex\" models (perhaps I should call them deep) that are capable of modelling more complex data distributions than the GPVLM and BPCA, but retain analytical solutions when inferring the posterior of the latent variables (like BPCA) or the mapping (like GPLVM)?\n What I like about the GPLVM and BPCA is that they possess an objective function (i.e. ELBO) that can be analytically optimised, as opposed to the intractable objective of VAEs that necessitates Monte-Carlo averages and stochastic gradient. Could somebody please point me to such examples of more complex generative models that admit analytical inference for working out the posterior of the latent variables or the mapping?\n -----\n This has also been posted on stack exchange: https://ai.stackexchange.com/q/42418/61537\n    submitted by    /u/ngiann  \n [link]   [comments]",

We need ways to inspect whether they really \"know\" something is true or not so we can reduce hallucinations.\n In a new paper, researchers found that LLMs contain an internal \"truth vector\" - an emergent linear structure that represents factual truth values.\n They had the insight to visualize how GPT represents simple true/false sentences. The true ones clustered together, while false ones clustered elsewhere - suggesting some kind of 'truth direction' in its learned representations.\n To test this, they trained linear \"probes\" on one dataset, and found they could generalize to accurately detect truth values in totally different datasets about other topics.\n They also directly modified the models to add or subtract the identified truth vectors from its processing of statements. This could flip assessments of truth value, showing the vector causally influences reasoning.\n Together, these findings provide evidence that neural networks can create emergent, linear structures that represent factual truth. This finding could eventually help make AI systems less prone to hallucinations and falsehoods.\n TLDR: LLMs can create emergent linear representations of truth.

          "description": "Hi!\n Happy to share a project I've been working on for a while: UI-Act\n https://github.com/TobiasNorlund/UI-Act\n It's an AI model architecture designed to autonomously navigate and interact with computers using the graphical user interface. Think of it as a co-pilot that \"sees\" your screen and acts on it, just as a human would.\n In essence, it's a custom transformer model taking prompt and screenshots as input, with output heads to predict low-level actions i.e. mouse clicks. In the demo, it has been trained to compute simple expressions in a calculator window, using expert demonstrations/behavior cloning. If scaled up appropriately however, it could provide a basis for a general agent to automate arbitrary tasks on a computer. \n I would be interested in hearing your thoughts on it, and especially with regards to the trend towards general AI agents and assistants (Windows Copilot / Adept ACT-1 / AutoGPT etc).\n LMs equipped with e.g. function-calling is a trendy approach, that rely on text-based state representations and APIs to take action. In cases where this is unfeasible, UI-based agents might provide a more general alternative. As the agent's interface to the computer is shared with humans, it can be easily taught using expert demonstrations, and require little or no technical expertice.\n Let me know what you think!\n    submitted by    /u/tobibbelfuel  \n [link]   [comments]",

Just completed a new chapter in the book An Introduction to Tsetlin Machines:\n https://tsetlinmachine.org\n Happy to receive feedback!\n Abstract: Collaboration can be essential to manage complex projects. One example is building a house. You then need the expertise of carpenters, plumbers, and electricians. Each profession brings unique skills to the table. Similarly, different types of Tsetlin machines can have distinct capabilities. In this chapter, you learn how Tsetlin machines can team up, allowing them to achieve more than they could on their own.\n The effectiveness of a team relies on recognising each member's strengths and limitations. Appreciating where your expertise stops and where your coworkers' expertise begins is crucial for effective collaboration. We first explore how Tsetlin machines can assess their competence in Section 7.1. Using the vote count from Chapter 1, you learn to measure how confident a Tsetlin machine is when it makes its decisions.\n It is possible to be highly confident and still perform poorly. To be trustworthy, confidence must be in line with one's capabilities. Therefore, Section 7.1 also covers how to evaluate trustworthiness.\n Next, in Section 7.2, you discover how to build a team of Tsetlin machines with different skills. By assessing each Tsetlin machine's confidence, you can lean on the confident ones when making decisions. The result is a Tsetlin machine composite - a construction where multiple Tsetlin machines join forces. You can think of it as a composite material, such as epoxy, which reinforces resin with fibres, making it strong, lightweight, and durable.\n    submitted by    /u/olegranmo  \n [link]   [comments]",

My goal is to create a digital twin of a network and then work on it from a cyber security point of view. I will briefly explain what I would like to do.\n I am currently using software for network vulnerability scans (OpenVAS). I use this software to perform network vulnerability scans at the network level, so basically to OpenVAS I pass a network (for example 192.168.xx.xx/24) to automatically identify all the vulnerabilities that are there.\n The next step ( what I'd like to do and that's why I'm asking for your advice) is to create a digital twin of the newly scanned network and then perform a penetration test on this digital twin of the network, without going to stress the actual network.\n Ideally, I would like to pass the output of the OpenVAS vulnerability scans, routing rules, and firewall rules to some tool that will then generate for me the digital twin of the network, which will then be used for offensive cybersecurity, so exploits, privilege escalation, etc.... will be tested on this digital twin without worrying about breaking some kind of service or stressing the real network.\n What I am asking is, do you know of any tool that would do the trick for me? So some tool that allows me to generate a digital twin of a network by providing as input vulnerability scans (xml,json,csv etc...), routing rules, firewall rules, pcap traces etc... \n Do you have any references or documentation? \n Are you aware of any open source tools?\n I thank you for your helpfulness!\n ​\n    submitted by    /u/Salt-Arugula-8128  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Quick intro\n Lineups are one of the first steps in the VFX pipeline\n Source:\n - orignal footage that was shot on set\n - a reference (quicktime) video from the film edit.\n Task:\n The reference shows modifications to the original footage. They can be :\n - timewarp (either fixed retimes like 200% speed or completely random)\n - transform (moved the image in x/y axis, rotation, scale, etc.)\n So the lineup task is to align the original footage to the reference quicktime.\n What I did so Far:\n Made a simple script in the software Nuke, using some Python and readily available tools to make it work on a simple shot. General logic is compare every frame and the associated one is the frame with the least difference between the two. This works on super simple and straightforward tasks. (can provide more info if needed).\n Issue:\n Some references are more heavily modified. They can have some muzzle flash, basic 3d objects or even some slight error introduced like a distortion applied to the image when none shouldn't so it will never be perfectly aligned. This makes the difference of the full frame higher for some frames, making the lineup wrong. (it will take the wrong frame that has no muzzle flash, because it has less difference...)Some other things to consider is that watermarks are covering the ref and the colors are not perfectly matching, can get them close enough, but there's a difference.\n Conclusion:\n Because of those issues, I'm thinking about using Machine Learning. I have next to no knowledge on the subject. I know there Is a bunch of ways to train a model, but no clue where to start, so here's my question :\n Which learning styles has the best potential to be able to solve this task?\n    submitted by    /u/Pretty_Customer_8113  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Transformers are great at NLP and computer vision tasks, but I was surprised to learn they still lag behind simple linear models at time series forecasting.\n The issue is how most Transformer architectures treat each timestamp as a token and fuse all the variable data from that moment. This makes two big problems:\n  \nVariables recorded at slightly different times get blurred together, losing important timing info\n Each token can only see a single moment, no long-term dependencies\n  \nSo Transformers struggle to extract useful patterns and correlations from the data.\n Some researchers from Tsinghua University took a fresh look at this and realized the Transformer components themselves are solid, they just need to flip the architecture for time series data.\n Their \"Inverted Transformer\" (or iTransformer):\n  \nMakes each variable's full history into a token, instead of each timestamp\n Uses self-attention over variables to capture relationships\n Processes time dependencies per variable with feedforward layers\n  \nThis simple tweak gives all the benefits we want:\n  \nState-of-the-art forecasting accuracy, beating both linear models and standard Transformers\n Better generalization to unseen variables\n Increased interpretability\n Ability to leverage longer historical context\n  \nTLDR: Inverting Transformers to align with time series structure allows them to outperform alternatives in working with time series data.\n Full summary.

          "description": "Multimodal sentiment analysis combines text, audio and video to understand human emotions. But extra inputs can add irrelevant or conflicting signals. So filtering matters.\n Researchers made a \"Adaptive Language-guided Multimodal Transformer\" (ALMT) that uses text to guide filtering of visual and audio data. This creates a \"hyper-modality\" with less noise that complements the text.\n They tested it on datasets like MOSI (YouTube reviews), MOSEI (YouTube clips) and CH-SIMS (Chinese videos). ALMT achieved improved accuracy:\n  \nMOSI: YouTube movie reviews with 2,199 samples. ALMT achieves state-of-the-art performance on various metrics including 6% higher 7-class accuracy.\n MOSEI: 22,856 YouTube clips covering sentiment-rich scenarios. ALMT improves multi-class accuracy by 3-5% over previous methods.\n CH-SIMS: Chinese dataset with over 2,000 video samples. ALMT surpasses prior work by 1.4% in binary accuracy.\n  \nAnalyses showed big drops in performance without the guided filtering, so this validates that it's the main innovation.\n Downsides are it needs lots of training data and has minor gains on sparse regression metrics. But overall the technique of filtering multimodal data under text guidance gives improvements.\n The concepts feel intuitive - use dominant signals to filter others and retain useful complements. My guess is it would transfer well to other multimodal tasks.\n TLDR: New way to filter multimodal data for sentiment analysis using text guidance improves performance. Shows the value in removing distracting signals. Sometimes less is more.\n Full summary here. Paper is here.\n    submitted by    /u/Successful-Western27  \n [link]   [comments]",

I wanted to advertise my new JAX optimisation library Optimistix!\n Optimistix has high-level APIs for minimisation, least-squares, root-finding, and fixed-point iteration and was written to take care of these kinds of subroutines in Diffrax.\n Here is the GitHub: https://github.com/patrick-kidger/optimistix\n The elevator pitch is Optimistix is really fast, especially to compile. It plays nicely with Optax for first-order gradient-based methods, and takes a lot of design inspiration from Equinox, representing the state of all the solvers as standard JAX PyTrees.\n For those familiar with classical nonlinear unconstrained optimisation, Optimistix does some pretty nifty new things. It introduces new abstractions for modular optimisers, allowing users to mix-and-match different optimisation techniques easily. For example, creating a BFGS optimiser with Levenberg-Marquardt style Tikhnov regularisation takes less than 10 lines of code in Optimistix.\n I'm using Optimistix as a tool for my own research, and continue to work on it as part of my PhD (supervised by Patrick Kidger.)

I'm working on long text PDF which are mostly scanned documents.\n One of the process involved after document layout analysis, is to recreate the document structure: creating sections, sub section, sub sub sections and so on. As of today, this task is done by parsing the title and finding out any ordering information (numeric, alphabetical or roman notation):\n 1. Title A 1.1 Title B 2. Title C 2.a) Title D \n This technique works only if a document follows this constraint (numeration). I want to go one step further, where the algorithm could create the document structure with any title ordering information.\n I believe that relying only on parsing cannot do the trick. What could be the options? Given that the only features are: title's text and title's position (x,y) in the document.

(1 year of internship + 1 year of Full time employment at the same company). Now, I am looking to get a Master's Degree in AI/ML/DS in Germany starting Winter 2024. I am a person with interests in Industry skills(Applied AI/ML) rather than the research/academia part as I don't wish to pursue a PhD nor do I want to be stuck in a Math-deep subject that may not be relevant for me in the future. On account of this, I wanted to know which college/degree offers the best balance in-between theory and applied AI/ML/DS.\n Also, people have been telling me that exams are super tough and it is hard to successfully complete an AI/ML/Data Science MS degree in Germany, Is it true? It has been super discouraging for me to hear this and is affecting me mentally to go through the application process.\n PS. CS/Electrical Degrees with good electives for AI/ML/DS are also good enough for me (Just hoping the coursework/grading is not too harsh) Also, it would be great if someone could clarify if an Electronics and Communications student can apply for a CS degree in Germany.\n Sorry for asking too many questions, TIA. :)\n    submitted by    /u/TheDivineKnight01  \n [link]   [comments]",

We introduce LATS (Language Agent Tree Search), a general framework that synergizes the capabilities of LLMs in planning, acting, and reasoning. Drawing inspiration from Monte Carlo tree search in model-based reinforcement learning, LATS employs LLMs as agents, value functions, and optimizers, repurposing their latent strengths for enhanced decision-making. What is crucial in this method is the use of an environment for external feedback, which offers a more deliberate and adaptive problem-solving mechanism that moves beyond the limitations of existing techniques. Our experimental evaluation across diverse domains, such as programming, HotPotQA, and WebShop, illustrates the applicability of LATS for both reasoning and acting. In particular, LATS achieves 94.4\\% for programming on HumanEval with GPT-4 and an average score of 75.9 for web browsing on WebShop with GPT-3.5, demonstrating the effectiveness and generality of our method. \n  \nhttps://preview.redd.it/ail2c1kbh9tb1.jpg?width=857&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a89d1f4ce3c536eecda3f7ab6027f304286f6c81\n https://preview.redd.it/j8xzx1kbh9tb1.jpg?width=1655&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c791756af926c7d472313b212de765e74c2b75da\n https://preview.redd.it/t47ne1kbh9tb1.jpg?width=1362&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=560e5dd82ad06fdb729ab8ea1434c98e5c1a2ed3\n https://preview.redd.it/r58es3kbh9tb1.jpg?width=1341&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d5681992547dd6248ade5729c545eb17e824b7ea\n https://preview.redd.it/7viy42kbh9tb1.jpg?width=1496&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=6454cfe65b511b34771cd510f67775be4e01c636\n ​\n    submitted by    /u/Singularian2501  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Title: Why Do We Need Weight Decay in Modern Deep Learning?\n Paper: https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.04415\n Abstract: Weight decay is a broadly used technique for training state-of-the-art deep networks, including large language models. Despite its widespread usage, its role remains poorly understood. In this work, we highlight that the role of weight decay in modern deep learning is different from its regularization effect studied in classical learning theory. For overparameterized deep networks, we show how weight decay modifies the optimization dynamics enhancing the ever-present implicit regularization of SGD via the loss stabilization mechanism. In contrast, for underparameterized large language models trained with nearly online SGD, we describe how weight decay balances the bias-variance tradeoff in stochastic optimization leading to lower training loss. Moreover, we show that weight decay also prevents sudden loss divergences for bfloat16 mixed-precision training which is a crucial tool for LLM training. Overall, we present a unifying perspective from ResNets on vision tasks to LLMs: weight decay is never useful as an explicit regularizer but instead changes the training dynamics in a desirable way.

Humans tackle new problems by drawing on intuition from similar experiences, which LLMs can't do.\n Researchers propose \"Thought Propagation\" to have LLMs reason more like humans - by thinking analogically. First, GPT is prompted to suggest related \"analogous\" problems to the input. Then it solves those. Finally, it aggregates the solutions to directly solve the input problem or extract useful strategies.\n They tested this technique on challenges like finding optimal graph paths, writing coherent stories, and planning for LLM agents. Across different models, it significantly boosted performance over regular prompting:\n  \n12% better at finding shortest paths\n 13% improvement in creative writing (human preference)\n 15% higher task completion for LLM agents\n  \nIt also beat chain-of-thought (there is a comparison to CoT and ToT in the paper).\n After 1-2 iterations, adding more layers of analogy didn't help much. Efficiently generating useful analogies is still difficult and that's a limitation.\n I think this is interesting because it shows the value of \"meta-cognition\" - having models reflect on their own reasoning. More techniques like this could incrementally improve LLMs' reasoning to be more human-like.\n TLDR: Teaching LLMs to reason analogically, using solutions for similar problems as hints, significantly boosts their complex reasoning ability.\n Full summary.

Identifying these risks is labor-intensive, necessitating implementing the tools, manually setting up the environment for each test scenario, and finding risky cases. As tools and agents become more complex, the high cost of testing these agents will make it increasingly difficult to find high-stakes, long-tailed risks. To address these challenges, we introduce ToolEmu: a framework that uses an LM to emulate tool execution and enables the testing of LM agents against a diverse range of tools and scenarios, without manual instantiation. Alongside the emulator, we develop an LM-based automatic safety evaluator that examines agent failures and quantifies associated risks. We test both the tool emulator and evaluator through human evaluation and find that 68.8% of failures identified with ToolEmu would be valid real-world agent failures. Using our curated initial benchmark consisting of 36 high-stakes tools and 144 test cases, we provide a quantitative risk analysis of current LM agents and identify numerous failures with potentially severe outcomes. Notably, even the safest LM agent exhibits such failures 23.9% of the time according to our evaluator, underscoring the need to develop safer LM agents for real-world deployment. \n  \nhttps://preview.redd.it/lupenzddh2tb1.jpg?width=1368&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=eaac22f0e3e4f5c2913aa9f2696e8fa0138967d9\n https://preview.redd.it/1dq443edh2tb1.jpg?width=1520&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=2119053825de1cdabeafe61151940c26190abfa0\n https://preview.redd.it/m9e933edh2tb1.jpg?width=1528&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=28c0093e8479feacb1e6f89bcb73de5994e30e8f\n ​\n    submitted by    /u/Singularian2501  \n [link]   [comments]",

Due to previous binarization methods collapsing LLMs, we propose a novel approach, Partially-Binarized LLM (PB-LLM), which can achieve extreme low-bit quantization while maintaining the linguistic reasoning capacity of quantized LLMs. Specifically, our exploration first uncovers the ineffectiveness of naive applications of existing binarization algorithms and highlights the imperative role of salient weights in achieving low-bit quantization. Thus, PB-LLM filters a small ratio of salient weights during binarization, allocating them to higher-bit storage, i.e., partially-binarization. PB-LLM is extended to recover the capacities of quantized LMMs, by analyzing from the perspective of post-training quantization (PTQ) and quantization aware training (QAT). Under PTQ, combining the concepts from GPTQ, we reconstruct the binarized weight matrix guided by the Hessian matrix and successfully recover the reasoning capacity of PB-LLM in low-bit. Under QAT, we freeze the salient weights during training, explore the derivation of optimal scaling factors crucial for minimizing the quantization error, and propose a scaling mechanism based on this derived scaling strategy for residual binarized weights. Those explorations and the developed methodologies significantly contribute to rejuvenating the performance of low-bit quantized LLMs and present substantial advancements in the field of network binarization for LLMs. \n  \nhttps://preview.redd.it/0eywtpal22tb1.jpg?width=1183&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ad044123bec485805f98ae7115b1959162705b9d\n    submitted by    /u/Singularian2501  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Despite being much safer and more efficient than intersections, roundabouts are tricky to design - small tweaks can ruin traffic flow. \n They're typically designed iteratively, which takes time. This is a pain for developing countries without resources to test options. But AI could help auto-generate diverse and valid design options.\n In a new paper, researchers propose using Generative Flow Networks (GFlowNets) to sample varied roundabout layouts. Their approach works by constructing layouts step-by-step, maximizing rewards for realism, diversity, and safety.\n They also use a clever approximation during training. Rather than simulating traffic, they quickly check road intersections to focus the search (This sped up training by 200x).\n The authors tested their generated roundabout designs on simulated road scenarios of different complexity. Their model generated more diverse designs than rule-based or reinforcement learning approaches while maintaining realism and traffic flow.\n Plus, as road connections increased, the model kept discovering novel options without compromising quality.\n I thought this paper was an awesome proof-of-concept for auto-generating better roundabouts with AI, and I especially liked the authors' angle of leveraging this technology to specifically help developing countries. This could help them design higher-quality transportation networks faster and cheaper. (Plus I also like Cities: Skylines but struggle at building roundabouts).\n TLDR: Roundabouts are costly to design. New paper demonstrates how AI can generate diverse, valid roundabout designs quickly to cut costs and raise quality. Helpful for infrastructure in developing countries.\n Full summary here.

          "description": "A recent work explores how weight decay controls the effective learning rate for different layers and neurons. This rotational behavior drastically differs between Adam with L2 regularization compared to Adam with decoupled weight decay (AdamW) and seems to be the reason AdamW performs better in practice. It could also explain why normalization methods like weight standardization work so well and irregular rotational behavior could contribute to the need for a learning rate warmup.\n Full Abstract: Weight decay can significantly impact the optimization dynamics of deep neural networks. In certain situations, the effects of weight decay and gradient updates on the magnitude of a parameter vector cancel out on average, forming a state known as equilibrium. This causes the expected rotation of the vector in each update to remain constant along with its magnitude. Importantly, equilibrium can arise independently for the weight vectors of different layers and neurons. These equilibria are highly homogeneous for some optimizer and normalization configurations, effectively balancing the average rotation—a proxy for the effective learning rate—across network components. In this work we explore the equilibrium states of multiple optimizers including AdamW and SGD with momentum, providing insights into interactions between the learning rate, weight decay, initialization, normalization and learning rate schedule. We show how rotational equilibrium can be enforced throughout training, eliminating the chaotic transient phase corresponding to the transition towards equilibrium, thus simplifying the training dynamics. Finally, we show that rotational behavior may play a key role in the effectiveness of AdamW compared to Adam with L2-regularization, the performance of different normalization layers, and the need for learning rate warmup.\n    submitted by    /u/PlantsAreSoooAwesome  \n [link]   [comments]",

We then pass the results into built-in evaluation functions, such as semantic similarity and autoeval, to quantitatively evaluate your result.\n PromptTools is agnostic to what LLMs and vector DBs you use. You can easily iterate over different system architectures forRAG. You can even bring your own fine-tuned models or write a custom integration. In addition, you can write your own evaluation metrics, and independently evaluate the results from the retrieval step as well.\n Our current integrations include:\n  \nLLM: OpenAI (chat, fine-tuned), Anthropic, Google Vertex/PaLM, Llama (local or via Replicate)\n Vector DB: Chroma, Weaviate, LanceDB, Pinecone, Qdrant\n Framework: LangChain, MindsDB\n  \nYou can get started with RAG in minutes by installing the library and running this example.\n As open-source maintainers, we’re always interested to hear the community’s pain points and requests.

          "description": "Paper: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.10309\n Github: https://github.com/wzcai99/Pixel-Navigator\n Abstract: Zero-shot object navigation is a challenging task for home-assistance robots. This task emphasizes visual grounding, commonsense inference, and locomotion abilities, where the first two are inherent in foundation models. But for the locomotion part, most works still depend on map-based planning approaches. The gap between RGB space and map space makes it difficult to directly transfer the knowledge from foundation models to navigation tasks. In this work, we propose a Pixel-guided Navigation skill (PixNav), which bridges the gap between the foundation models and the embodied navigation task. It is straightforward for recent foundation models to indicate an object by pixels, and with pixels as the goal specification, our method becomes a versatile navigation policy towards all different kinds of objects. Besides, our PixNav is a pure RGB-based policy that can reduce the cost of home-assistance robots. Experiments demonstrate the robustness of the PixNav which achieves 80+% success rate in the local path-planning task. To perform long-horizon object navigation, we design an LLM-based planner to utilize the commonsense knowledge between objects and rooms to select the best waypoint. Evaluations across both photorealistic indoor simulators and real-world environments validate the effectiveness of our proposed navigation strategy.\n https://preview.redd.it/5qtd7ralgwsb1.png?width=828&format=png&auto=webp&s=118d5a1e8a083130b6d64bf1602af0417067aac8\n https://preview.redd.it/jwr2nnorgwsb1.png?width=1984&format=png&auto=webp&s=20062d7982c0eb1906fe0f6964d4b42e45b44a51\n https://preview.redd.it/llk4ubitgwsb1.png?width=1986&format=png&auto=webp&s=eb4894d52d7d8a82d97d83a2ff7a6be83da11af2\n    submitted by    /u/Character_Push3985  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Paper: https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.17288v1 \n Github: https://github.com/LinkSoul-AI/AutoAgents \n Abstract:\n  \nLarge language models (LLMs) have enabled remarkable advances in automated task-solving with multi-agent systems. However, most existing LLM-based multi-agent approaches rely on predefined agents to handle simple tasks, limiting the adaptability of multi-agent collaboration to different scenarios. Therefore, we introduce AutoAgents, an innovative framework that adaptively generates and coordinates multiple specialized agents to build an AI team according to different tasks. Specifically, AutoAgents couples the relationship between tasks and roles by dynamically generating multiple required agents based on task content and planning solutions for the current task based on the generated expert agents. Multiple specialized agents collaborate with each other to efficiently accomplish tasks. Concurrently, an observer role is incorporated into the framework to reflect on the designated plans and agents' responses and improve upon them. Our experiments on various benchmarks demonstrate that AutoAgents generates more coherent and accurate solutions than the existing multi-agent methods. This underscores the significance of assigning different roles to different tasks and of team cooperation, offering new perspectives for tackling complex tasks. \n  \nhttps://preview.redd.it/2jmnr73kymsb1.jpg?width=1663&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=08f53d5da3d12e685c5d4b24f27628d880a917c1\n https://preview.redd.it/jklyr73kymsb1.jpg?width=824&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=6f69b2fc5ef4bda60553da0bb953bd3c07ad506b\n https://preview.redd.it/elatla3kymsb1.jpg?width=1029&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e7e508cedd17b4798c9f90bf1c089beff3042f4a\n ​\n    submitted by    /u/Singularian2501  \n [link]   [comments]",

English prompts were blocked over 99% of the time, for comparison.\n The study benchmarked attacks across 12 diverse languages and categories:\n  \nHigh-resource: English, Chinese, Arabic, Hindi\n Mid-resource: Ukrainian, Bengali, Thai, Hebrew\n Low-resource: Zulu, Scots Gaelic, Hmong, Guarani\n  \nThe low-resource languages showed serious vulnerability to generating harmful responses, with combined attack success rates of around 79%. Mid-resource language success rates were much lower at 22%, while high-resource languages showed minimal vulnerability at around 11% success.\n Attacks worked as well as state-of-the-art techniques without needing adversarial prompts.\n These languages are used by 1.2 billion speakers today and allows easy exploitation by translating prompts. The English-centric focus misses vulnerabilities in other languages.\n TLDR: Bypassing safety in AI chatbots is easy by translating prompts to low-resource languages (like Zulu, Scots Gaelic, Hmong, and Guarani).

          "description": "Nicholas Crispino, Kyle Montgomery, Fankun Zeng, Dawn Song, Chenguang Wang\n Paper: https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.03710\n Abstract: We introduce a method to improve the zero-shot reasoning abilities of large language models on general language understanding tasks. Specifically, we build an autonomous agent to instruct the reasoning process of large language models. We show this approach further unleashes the zero-shot reasoning abilities of large language models to more tasks. We study the performance of our method on a wide set of datasets spanning generation, classification, and reasoning. We show that our method generalizes to most tasks and obtains state-of-the-art zero-shot performance on 20 of the 29 datasets that we evaluate. For instance, our method boosts the performance of state-of-the-art large language models by a large margin, including Vicuna-13b (13.3%), Llama-2-70b-chat (23.2%), and GPT-3.5 Turbo (17.0%). Compared to zero-shot chain of thought, our improvement in reasoning is striking, with an average increase of 10.5%. With our method, Llama-2-70b-chat outperforms zero-shot GPT-3.5 Turbo by 10.2%.

I have not included frequency in my feature set because these G parameters have been measured for the same set of frequencies for all PCBs.

          "description": "Researchers at Meta trained a deep learning model on brain recordings and audio data from 169 people listening to speech. Their method achieves up to 73% accuracy at identifying a 3-second clip of speech from non-invasive EEG or MEG scans.\n This is a massive improvement over previous attempts at decoding speech from neural signals. It approaches the performance of studies using implanted electrodes.\n The key innovations:\n  \nA contrastive loss function that aligns latent speech and brain representations\n Leveraging pretrained speech models like wav2vec 2.0\n Training one model on multiple subjects with individual tuning\n  \nBeing able to decode speech intention from brainwaves could one day help restore communication for patients suffering from strokes, ALS, etc.\n There's still a ways to go before this becomes a medical reality. Performance needs to improve and be validated during speech production rather than just passive listening. And the accuracy isn't high enough for natural conversations.\n But this is a hugely promising step toward brain-computer interfaces. Really interesting work at the intersection of neuroscience and AI!\n TLDR: New model achieves up to 73% accuracy decoding speech directly from non-invasive brain scans.

          "description": "Can LLMs actually improve their own reasoning by self-correcting mistakes? A new paper from DeepMind and the University of Illinois looks to answer this quantitatively.\n The results show that unaided, LLMs struggle at self-correction for reasoning tasks. The core issue is LLMs have trouble reliably evaluating the correctness of their own responses. They rarely identify flaws in initial reasoning. Sometimes LLMs even alter initially correct responses to become incorrect after self-correction! (I've personally seen this when interacting with ChatGPT many times and you probably have too).\n More complex techniques like critiquing between LLM instances don't help much either. External feedback or guidance looks necessary to improve reasoning (Well, some interesting parallels to this paper here about implicit improvement from preference data vs traditional RLHF).\n Self-correction does show promise for things like making responses more polite or safe though. Criteria there are more clear-cut.\n The authors argue we need to balance enthusiasm with realistic expectations on self-correction. It has a lot of limits for improving reasoning (at least with current models). But they suggest promising directions like incorporating high-quality external feedback from humans, training data, and tools. That could be key to unlocking self-correction's potential down the road.\n TLDR: Basically title... LLMs can't reliably self-correct reasoning yet. Maybe hybrid techniques combining self-correction with external guidance could work but we need more research.\n Full summary.

          "description": "Paper: https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.02244\n Abstract: \n  \nBy classifying infinite-width neural networks and identifying the optimal limit, Tensor Programs IV and V demonstrated a universal way, called μP, for widthwise hyperparameter transfer, i.e., predicting optimal hyperparameters of wide neural networks from narrow ones. Here we investigate the analogous classification for depthwise parametrizations of deep residual networks (resnets). We classify depthwise parametrizations of block multiplier and learning rate by their infinite-width-then-depth limits. In resnets where each block has only one layer, we identify a unique optimal parametrization, called Depth-μP that extends μP and show empirically it admits depthwise hyperparameter transfer. We identify feature diversity as a crucial factor in deep networks, and Depth-μP can be characterized as maximizing both feature learning and feature diversity. Exploiting this, we find that absolute value, among all homogeneous nonlinearities, maximizes feature diversity and indeed empirically leads to significantly better performance. However, if each block is deeper (such as modern transformers), then we find fundamental limitations in all possible infinite-depth limits of such parametrizations, which we illustrate both theoretically and empirically on simple networks as well as Megatron transformer trained on Common Crawl.\n  \nInteresting, great to see this line of work continued, muP was great, now Depth-muP\n    submitted by    /u/_puhsu  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Project Page\n Paper\n Code\n  \nWe present a novel type of neural fields that uses general radial bases for signal representation. State-of-the-art neural fields typically rely on grid-based representations for storing local neural features and N-dimensional linear kernels for interpolating features at continuous query points. The spatial positions of their neural features are fixed on grid nodes and cannot well adapt to target signals. Our method instead builds upon general radial bases with flexible kernel position and shape, which have higher spatial adaptivity and can more closely fit target signals. To further improve the channel-wise capacity of radial basis functions, we propose to compose them with multi-frequency sinusoid functions. This technique extends a radial basis to multiple Fourier radial bases of different frequency bands without requiring extra parameters, facilitating the representation of details. Moreover, by marrying adaptive radial bases with grid-based ones, our hybrid combination inherits both adaptivity and interpolation smoothness. We carefully designed weighting schemes to let radial bases adapt to different types of signals effectively. Our experiments on 2D image and 3D signed distance field representation demonstrate the higher accuracy and compactness of our method than prior arts. When applied to neural radiance field reconstruction, our method achieves state-of-the-art rendering quality, with small model size and comparable training speed.\n  \n   submitted by    /u/Sirisian  \n [link]   [comments]",

Once the training was complete, I took the next step and deployed my model on the Hugging Face Spaces app, allowing my friends to put it to the test. But here's where I ran into a significant challenge: users could even upload their own selfies, and my model would attempt to predict whether they were a crocodile or a piece of driftwood!\n So how can I leverage object detection or the image segmentation pipeline so that when the user inputs their image, it tries to detect the object from the photo and then detect whether the detected object from the given image contains a crocodile or not?

In domains from NLP to Computer Vision, this has led to a consolidation of pretrained models, with general pretrained backbones serving as a starting point for many applications. Can such a consolidation happen in robotics? Conventionally, robotic learning methods train a separate model for every application, every robot, and even every environment. Can we instead train “generalist” X-robot policy that can be adapted efficiently to new robots, tasks, and environments? In this paper, we provide datasets in standardized data formats and models to make it possible to explore this possibility in the context of robotic manipulation, alongside experimental results that provide an example of effective X-robot policies. We assemble a dataset from 22 different robots collected through a collaboration between 21 institutions, demonstrating 527 skills (160266 tasks). We show that a high-capacity model trained on this data, which we call RT-X, exhibits positive transfer and improves the capabilities of multiple robots by leveraging experience from other platforms. \n  \nhttps://preview.redd.it/oxzutrhtb1sb1.jpg?width=1693&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=37b8b1dbf5f489dc2c8eaca4d15cb9c32ebc2660\n https://preview.redd.it/ldsiwshtb1sb1.jpg?width=1494&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=fdbf0f91c705acf11bff854f6d6af82dddd47021\n https://preview.redd.it/ikk18jitb1sb1.jpg?width=1693&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e50b443dc4b0266a0480d54c4f92a0b708485797\n https://preview.redd.it/t5wmciitb1sb1.jpg?width=1361&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=2971fd645acb6dcbed2ca3522e311d0772c45964\n ​\n    submitted by    /u/Singularian2501  \n [link]   [comments]",

However, current methods primarily focus on the case of learning a single concept from multiple images with variations in backgrounds and poses, and struggle when adapted to a different scenario. In this work, we introduce the task of textual scene decomposition: given a single image of a scene that may contain several concepts, we aim to extract a distinct text token for each concept, enabling fine-grained control over the generated scenes. To this end, we propose augmenting the input image with masks that indicate the presence of target concepts. These masks can be provided by the user or generated automatically by a pre-trained segmentation model. We then present a novel two-phase customization process that optimizes a set of dedicated textual embeddings (handles), as well as the model weights, striking a delicate balance between accurately capturing the concepts and avoiding overfitting. We employ a masked diffusion loss to enable handles to generate their assigned concepts, complemented by a novel loss on cross-attention maps to prevent entanglement. We also introduce union-sampling, a training strategy aimed to improve the ability of combining multiple concepts in generated images. We use several automatic metrics to quantitatively compare our method against several baselines, and further affirm the results using a user study.

          "description": "LLMs like GPT-3 struggle in streaming uses like chatbots because their performance tanks on long texts exceeding their training length. I checked out a new paper investigating why windowed attention fails for this.\n By visualizing the attention maps, the researchers noticed LLMs heavily attend initial tokens as \"attention sinks\" even if meaningless. This anchors the distribution.\n They realized evicting these sink tokens causes the attention scores to get warped, destabilizing predictions.\n Their proposed \"StreamingLLM\" method simply caches a few initial sink tokens plus recent ones. This tweaks LLMs to handle crazy long texts. Models tuned with StreamingLLM smoothly processed sequences with millions of tokens, and were up to 22x faster than other approaches. \n Even cooler - adding a special \"[Sink Token]\" during pre-training further improved streaming ability. The model just used that single token as the anchor. I think the abstract says it best:\n  \nWe introduce StreamingLLM, an efficient framework that enables LLMs trained with a finite length attention window to generalize to infinite sequence length without any fine-tuning. We show that StreamingLLM can enable Llama-2, MPT, Falcon, and Pythia to perform stable and efficient language modeling with up to 4 million tokens and more.\n  \nTLDR: LLMs break on long convos. Researchers found they cling to initial tokens as attention sinks. Caching those tokens lets LLMs chat infinitely.\n Full summary here\n Paper link: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.17453.pdf\n    submitted by    /u/Successful-Western27  \n [link]   [comments]",

We are modestly versed in ML/DL techniques, and want to use everything we know on a really good capstone project for this course. We are looking for a dataset where we can demonstrate a nice variety of techniques to really blow the socks off our Professor. \n Ideally we'd like this to be stemming from something basic that most would consider \"Data Science\", as in something with a tabular dataset and elements of classification. Though we still want chances to bring in what we know from outside the course: for example, if there's images to supplement the dataset we could use Image Classification models or something multimodal to bring in more features, if there's natural language data then we could use LLMs to extract salient features etc. More importantly though, we want something whose exploration can be really motivated so it doesn't seem we're only in it for the ML aspect.\n Thank you!\n    submitted by    /u/Subject-Revolution-3  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "When trying to get language models to solve complex math problems, researchers kept running into limits. Models like GPT-3 and ChatGPT still struggle with advanced algebra, calculus, and geometry questions. The math is just too abstract and symbol-heavy for them.\n To break through this barrier, researchers from Tsinghua University and Microsoft taught models to combine natural language reasoning with calling external math tools.\n The key is their new \"tool-integrated reasoning\" format. Models generate a natural language plan first, then write code to invoke tools like SymPy to solve equations. They take the output results and continue verbal reasoning.\n By interleaving natural language and symbolic computations, they get the best of both worlds - semantic understanding from language models and rigorous math from tools.\n They trained versions of the LLaMA model this way, producing their Tool-Integrated Reasoning Agent (TORA). They present some strong results:\n  \nIn evaluations on 10 math datasets, TORA substantially outperformed prior state-of-the-art methods, achieving 13-19% higher accuracy on average.\n On one competition test, TORA-7B scored 40% accuracy, beating the previous best model by 22 percentage points.\n  \nThis demonstrates that integrating tools directly into the reasoning process can significantly enhance mathematical capabilities, even for large models like GPT-4.\n However, tough problems involving geometry and advanced algebra are still there. New techniques for symbolic reasoning and spatial understanding will likely be needed to push further.\n Overall though, tool integration seems a promising path to improve reasoning skills. Applying this to other domains like logic and programming could also be impactful.\n TLDR: Teaching language models to use math tools helps them solve way more complex problems.\n Full Paper Summary\n arXiv Link\n    submitted by    /u/Successful-Western27  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "We developed a statistical model to estimate “How many unique identities can a generative face model generate?” without exhaustively generating a lot of faces.\n Abstract: There has been tremendous progress in generating realistic faces with high fidelity over the past few years. Despite this progress, a crucial question remains unanswered: “Given a generative face model, how many unique identities can it generate?” In other words, what is the biometric capacity of the generative face model? A scientific basis for answering this question will benefit evaluating and comparing different generative face models and establish an upper bound on their scalability. This paper proposes a statistical approach to estimate the biometric capacity of generated face images in a hyperspherical feature space. We employ our approach on multiple generative models, including unconditional generators like StyleGAN, Latent Diffusion Model, and “Generated Photos,” as well as DCFace, a class-conditional generator. We also estimate capacity w.r.t. demographic attributes such as gender and age. Our capacity estimates indicate that (a) under ArcFace representation at a false acceptance rate (FAR) of 0.1%, StyleGAN3 and DCFace have a capacity upper bound of 1.43 million and 11,900, respectively; (b) the capacity reduces drastically as we lower the desired FAR with an estimate of 17,960 and 562 at FAR of 1% and 10%, respectively, for StyleGAN3; (c) there is no discernible disparity in the capacity w.r.t gender; and (d) for some generative models, there is an appreciable disparity in the capacity w.r.t age.\n Paper: https://arxiv.org/abs/arXiv:2308.02065\n Code: https://github.com/human-analysis/capacity-generative-face-models\n    submitted by    /u/VishDev  \n [link]   [comments]",

In this paper, we analyze the latest model, GPT-4V(ision), to deepen the understanding of LMMs. The analysis focuses on the intriguing tasks that GPT-4V can perform, containing test samples to probe the quality and genericity of GPT-4V's capabilities, its supported inputs and working modes, and the effective ways to prompt the model. In our approach to exploring GPT-4V, we curate and organize a collection of carefully designed qualitative samples spanning a variety of domains and tasks. Observations from these samples demonstrate that GPT-4V's unprecedented ability in processing arbitrarily interleaved multimodal inputs and the genericity of its capabilities together make GPT-4V a powerful multimodal generalist system. Furthermore, GPT-4V's unique capability of understanding visual markers drawn on input images can give rise to new human-computer interaction methods such as visual referring prompting. We conclude the report with in-depth discussions on the emerging application scenarios and the future research directions for GPT-4V-based systems. We hope that this preliminary exploration will inspire future research on the next-generation multimodal task formulation, new ways to exploit and enhance LMMs to solve real-world problems, and gaining better understanding of multimodal foundation models. \n  \nhttps://preview.redd.it/qkytzg2rjqrb1.jpg?width=511&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=fc306dc6ae64100e993639f8e27583b809bf8a5c\n https://preview.redd.it/z4kq0l2rjqrb1.jpg?width=507&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d4fda59456846fa7a6c9b318b21fc9c544bd2b68\n https://preview.redd.it/1ptrkk2rjqrb1.jpg?width=712&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=2b44fbc949e76fdf20d05b1236f56c87ba5efece\n ​\n ​\n    submitted by    /u/Singularian2501  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I've been using Perplexity.ai for a bit now when it hit me that I don't understand how they can sustain their business model with search. Stuff like Bing search and Google search cost around $5 or more per 1000 searches, so how can they even afford to do this kind of search. Do they have their own search index.\n Also, I don't know how they pull in the data from these sources so fast? I've played around with some things like this with Langchain with retrieval, but the speed of splitting and tokenizing website html is not very fast. Have they already pre-scrapped the websites from the search results and tokenized them for LLM retrieval?\n    submitted by    /u/dragon18456  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "When visualizing the inner workings of vision transformers (ViTs), researchers noticed weird spikes of attention on random background patches. This didn't make sense since the models should focus on foreground objects.\n By analyzing the output embeddings, they found a small number of tokens (2%) had super high vector norms, causing the spikes.\n The high-norm \"outlier\" tokens occurred in redundant areas and held less local info but more global info about the image.\n Their hypothesis is that ViTs learn to identify unimportant patches and recycle them as temporary storage instead of discarding. This enables efficient processing but causes issues.\n Their fix is simple - just add dedicated \"register\" tokens that provide storage space, avoiding the recycling side effects.\n Models trained with registers have:\n  \nSmoother and more meaningful attention maps\n Small boosts in downstream performance\n Way better object discovery abilities\n  \nThe registers give ViTs a place to do their temporary computations without messing stuff up. Just a tiny architecture tweak improves interpretability and performance. Sweet!\n I think it's cool how they reverse-engineered this model artifact and fixed it with such a small change. More work like this will keep incrementally improving ViTs.\n TLDR: Vision transformers recycle useless patches to store data, causing problems. Adding dedicated register tokens for storage fixes it nicely.\n Full summary. Paper is here.\n    submitted by    /u/Successful-Western27  \n [link]   [comments]",

Or would it be possible to take, say, Flan-UL2 (20B), chop off its decoder, and train a much smaller decoder on top of it with the UL2 encoder frozen (ie how one trains adapter layers).\n Assuming the decoder hyperparameters are kept small, would this be possible within reasonable compute budget? Would that even meaningfully converge with small amount of compute (assuming same training objective as is for UL2)?\n Would the strength (ie somewhat comparable to 10B if we cut 20B in half) transfer from the SOTA encoder, or would cutting off half of the model layers kneecap it too badly?\n [1] https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.10369.pdf\n [2] https://aclanthology.org/2023.sustainlp-1.6.pdf\n [3] https://github.com/snoop2head/Deep-Encoder-Shallow-Decoder\n    submitted by    /u/upalse  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Is there any notable work on duplicating layers in large feed forward models? In contrast to e.g. the brain which is essentially a directed graph most networks utilized nowerdays use a feed forward approach. E.g. transformers are able to attend to past tokens, but generate the tokens in a way where for a given token a given weight is not utilized at different stages in the feed forward pass. In my intuition this would lead to an issue where concepts (factual data as well as learned \"algorithms\") might be duplicated as they are needed at different depths in the generation process and are sequentially dependent on one another. This does not directly make the model less capable, as it might learn the same concept at two layers sufficiently well, but it reduces the data and parameter efficiency and and might impact generalization capabilities. Using a full on brain like graph might be hard to implement/optimize/scale on current hardware and is tricky with the backprop. But is there any work on duplicating a few layers, placing them at different depths in large models. I would guess that this would be more impactful for large models. One would essentially trade compute for better data efficiency.\n    submitted by    /u/floriv1999  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hey everyone. I am very passionate about getting in ML research and was wondering what the learning pathway was, particularly with regards to the theoretical Math and Statistics involved.\n For context:\n  \nI am a second year undergraduate. By the end of this year, I will have taken and finished A Multivariable Calculus with Proofs course, so that is my current starting point.\n I have been working with ML for the last 3 years and am proficient in Python and frameworks like PyTorch.\n I have also made my own implementation of several research papers (LSTMs, GRUs, Transformers, ELMo, BERT, GPT, as well as a few computer vision papers).\n  \nI have a good general intuition of how deep learning works, but I want to formalise this knowledge with the adequate mathematical background so that I can eventually pursue a career in research. I understand that I have plenty of time until I reach there, and I am willing to dedicate it to grinding out the math and statistical knowledge required.\n I have done my research on this sub and other forums, and here are a few resources that stood out:\n  \nMathematics for Machine Learning by Deisenroth, Faisal and Ong\n Advanced Calculus of Several Variables by C. H. Edwards Jr.\n Mathematical Methods Lecture Notes from Imperial College by Deisenroth and Cheraghchi\n The original information theory paper by Shannon\n The Elements of Statistical Learning by Hastie, Tibshirani and Friedman\n Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning by Bishop\n The Probabalistic Machine Learning Series by Kevin P. Murphy\n Deep Learning by Goodfellow, Bengio and Courville\n Mathematics of Machine Learning on MIT OCW (here)\n  \nMy question is, what order should I start self-learning in, given the (somewhat limited) background knowledge I have? Also, are there any other resources that would help?\n    submitted by    /u/Far_Clothes_5054  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Project Page\n Paper\n Code \n  \nIn this paper, we present Gaussian Splatting based text-to-3D generation (GSGEN), a novel approach for generating high-quality 3D objects. Previous methods suffer from inaccurate geometry and limited fidelity due to the absence of 3D prior and proper representation. We leverage 3D Gaussian Splatting, a recent state-of-the-art representation, to address existing shortcomings by exploiting the explicit nature that enables the incorporation of 3D prior. Specifically, our method adopts a progressive optimization strategy, which includes a geometry optimization stage and an appearance refinement stage. In geometry optimization, a coarse representation is established under a 3D geometry prior along with the ordinary 2D SDS loss, ensuring a sensible and 3D-consistent rough shape. Subsequently, the obtained Gaussians undergo an iterative refinement to enrich details. In this stage, we increase the number of Gaussians by compactness-based densification to enhance continuity and improve fidelity. With these designs, our approach can generate 3D content with delicate details and more accurate geometry. Extensive evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, especially for capturing high-frequency components.\n  \n   submitted by    /u/Sirisian  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hi! I just open-sourced a project that I've been working on for a while and wanted to see what you think!\n The goal of Carton (https://carton.run) is to let you use a single interface to run any machine learning model from any programming language.\n It’s currently difficult to integrate models that use different technologies (e.g. TensorRT, Ludwig, TorchScript, JAX, GGML, etc) into your application, especially if you’re not using Python. Even if you learn the details of integrating each of these frameworks, running multiple frameworks in one process can cause hard-to-debug crashes.\n Ideally, the ML framework a model was developed in should just be an implementation detail. Carton lets you decouple your application from specific ML frameworks so you can focus on the problem you actually want to solve.\n At a high level, the way Carton works is by running models in their own processes and using an IPC system to communicate back and forth with low overhead. Carton is primarily implemented in Rust, with bindings to other languages. There are lots more details linked in the architecture doc below.\n Importantly, Carton uses your model’s original underlying framework (e.g. PyTorch) under the hood to actually execute the model. This is meaningful because it makes Carton composable with other technologies. For example, it’s easy to use custom ops, TensorRT, etc without changes. This lets you keep up with cutting-edge advances, but decouples them from your application.\n I’ve been working on Carton for almost a year now and I open sourced it on Wednesday!\n Some useful links:\n  \nWebsite, docs, quickstart - https://carton.run\n Explore existing models - https://carton.pub\n Repo - https://github.com/VivekPanyam/carton\n Architecture - https://github.com/VivekPanyam/carton/blob/main/ARCHITECTURE.md\n  \nPlease let me know what you think!\n    submitted by    /u/vpanyam  \n [link]   [comments]",

In this work, we propose RealFill, a novel generative approach for image completion that fills in missing regions of an image with the content that should have been there. RealFill is a generative inpainting model that is personalized using only a few reference images of a scene. These reference images do not have to be aligned with the target image, and can be taken with drastically varying viewpoints, lighting conditions, camera apertures, or image styles. Once personalized, RealFill is able to complete a target image with visually compelling contents that are faithful to the original scene. We evaluate RealFill on a new image completion benchmark that covers a set of diverse and challenging scenarios, and find that it outperforms existing approaches by a large margin.\n  \n​\n    submitted by    /u/StrawberryNumberNine  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I have a CNN model, call it model M. It was trained on dataset A for object pose estimation. After training for 100 epochs, it resulted in these losses:\n  \nTrain: 0.06\n Val: 0.08\n  \nAs dataset A is somewhat limited, I wonder if I can incorporate additional data via a different, but related task: object segmentation for similar objects. Model M is a UNet, so I can incorporate this task simply with an additional output channel in the last layer. \n I add dataset B for object segmentation. During training, M learns on both datasets quite well, which suggests to me that the tasks are well-aligned. After 100 epochs, I get these losses on dataset A:\n  \nTrain: 0.06\n Val: 0.16\n  \nThis is surprising to me. If I get the same training loss on dataset A, while training on additional data. I'd expect the validation loss to be lower, since I'm training on 2x the data. Yet the validation performance is consistently higher when I train on both datasets. \n The only explanation I can think of is the double descent phenomenon. Perhaps when I trained only on dataset A, I was significantly over-parameterized, but past the interpolation threshold. So perhaps adding more data brought me closer to the interpolation threshold, leading to worse generalization.\n Does this explanation seem likely? Has anyone had similar experiences?\n    submitted by    /u/murrdpirate  \n [link]   [comments]",

I'm working on a Tetris AI and am representing the 10x20 grid cubes with a one hot encoded dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/conlan/tetris-training-set-9262023\n This means my data has 208 features (200 for the grid cubes being on/off, 7 for the \"next shape\" box, and 1 for the labeled best move.\n I currently have 9460 labeled samples and have done some preliminary fitting here: https://www.kaggle.com/code/conlan/tetris-ai?scriptVersionId=144388350 with a highest f1_macro score of 0.431090.\n Does anyone have suggestions for which direction to take from here to improve? Currently I see:\n  \nCollect More Data\n Tune Hyperparameters\n Rework Features\n  \nI'm hesitant to rework the features as that would require telling the model more specifics and would like to keep it abstract, but maybe 200 is crazy high? Or maybe <10k samples is too low and I should just keep collecting data?\n Thanks in advance!\n    submitted by    /u/conlanrios  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "ood morning everyone,\n I am currently reading the book of Mr. Burkov: Machine Learning Engineering. He talk about a step that might be helpful before training a ML model: Feature Scaling. Furthermore, he adds that before Feature Scaling, you might do Feature Transformation (Log, Square,...) in order to make your data look normal and have better models. How true do you think this statement is? Do you also transform your feature, and then scale them? How often do you do it? It is important for Regression or SVM, but do you do it also for other black box algorithms such as Random Forests? What are the best practices according to you?\n    submitted by    /u/dekozr  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Researchers from Microsoft have just proposed using a psychological assessment tool called the Defining Issues Test (DIT) to evaluate the moral reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) like GPT-3, ChatGPT, etc.\n The DIT presents moral dilemmas and has subjects rate and rank the importance of various ethical considerations related to the dilemma. It allows quantifying the sophistication of moral thinking through a P-score.\n In this new paper, the researchers tested prominent LLMs with adapted DIT prompts containing AI-relevant moral scenarios.\n Key findings:\n  \nLarge models like GPT-3 failed to comprehend prompts and scored near random baseline in moral reasoning.\n ChatGPT, Text-davinci-003 and GPT-4 showed coherent moral reasoning with above-random P-scores.\n Surprisingly, the smaller 70B LlamaChat model outscored larger models in its P-score, demonstrating advanced ethics understanding is possible without massive parameters.\n The models operated mostly at intermediate conventional levels as per Kohlberg's moral development theory. No model exhibited highly mature moral reasoning.\n  \nI think this is an interesting framework to evaluate and improve LLMs' moral intelligence before deploying them into sensitive real-world environments - to the extent that a model can be said to possess moral intelligence (or, seem to possess it?).\n Here's a link to my full summary with a lot more background on Kohlberg's model (had to read up on it since I didn't study psych).

To avoid training models on erroneous data and save QA teams significant time, you can now use automated algorithms invented by our scientists.\n Our newest paper introduces Cleanlab Object Detection: a novel algorithm to assess label quality in any object detection dataset and catch errors (named ObjectLab for short). Extensive benchmarks show Cleanlab Object Detection identifies mislabeled images with better precision/recall than other approaches. When applied to the famous COCO dataset, Cleanlab Object Detection automatically discovers hundreds of mislabeled images, including errors where annotators mistakenly: overlooked an object that should’ve had a bounding box, sloppily drew a box in a poor location, or chose the wrong class label for an annotated object.\n We’ve open-sourced one line of code to find errors in any object detection dataset via Cleanlab Object Detection, which can utilize any existing object detection model you’ve trained. \n For those interested, you can check out the 5-minute tutorial to get started and the blog to read the details.\n    submitted by    /u/jonas__m  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Training giant AI models like GPT-3 requires large resources - thousands of GPUs running for months. As a solo researcher without access to that kind of scale, I can't easily reproduce experiments and findings from papers on huge models.\n But a new paper from DeepMind shows you can recreate and study training instabilities seen in massive models by using small ones.\n The key is increasing the learning rate:\n  \nThis reproduces \"attention collapse\" where the model focuses on just a few tokens, like overfitting.\n Also can reproduce \"logit divergence\" where output values drift unstably.\n  \nThese issues have been reported when scaling up to billions of params. The cool part is techniques that fix them for giant models also work for small models:\n  \nqk-layernorm prevents attention collapse.\n Adding a \"z-loss\" term stops logit divergence.\n  \nSome other highlights from the paper include:\n  \nLonger warmup helps stability, especially for bigger models.\n Decoupling LR and weight decay improves stability.\n Depth increases sensitivity much faster than width.\n Can predict upcoming issues from scaling trends.\n Default epsilon hurts at large scale.\n  \nIf the authors are right, one more tool that lets researchers study and even help train giant models without Google-size resources. Small models can guide large model development, sort of like how you can build a scale train set to study and improve how a railroad system works... for a lot less money than starting your own railroad company, buying land, building real tracks, etc.\n Full summary.

The initial $20M round was led by Nat Friedman, Danial Gross, Patrick Collision, Tobi Lutke, Jim Keller, Sequoia Capital, and Capital Factory. In December 2022, Carmack departed as consulting CTO at Meta to focus his efforts on AGI.\n Sutton is the principal founder of the field of reinforcement learning. His work with Keen Technologies advances previously announced research priorities to understand basic computational intelligence. Through this work, documented in part in The Alberta Plan, Sutton seeks to understand and create long-lived computation agents that interact with a vastly more complex world and come to predict and control their sensory input signals.\n https://www.amii.ca/latest-from-amii/john-carmack-and-rich-sutton-agi/\n    submitted by    /u/blabboy  \n [link]   [comments]",

I understand that modern ML is going in the opposite low-precision direction, but I still think that it may be useful to have this functionality at least for some prototyping and development of concepts.\n The double-double approach to the evaluation of quads represents an FP128 number as an unevaluated sum of two double numbers (like 1 and 1e-17 - the second one is smaller than 1 ULP of the first one).

          "description": "TYPO IN THE TITLE: I wanted the title to be \"why should neural networks be end-to-end?\" My lazy ass was swipe texting on my phone and this typo happened. FML\n Especially in robotics, there's been a lot of research for end-to-end neutral networks where an image is the input and the control action is the output, for say, tasks like pick an object and place it somewhere. I feel this is very restrictive while developing such a solution because it tightly couples the \"control\" network to the \"estimation\" network. This reduces modularity in building the solution, i.e., if I find a better controller architecture (machine learning based or rule based) I'm unable to use that for the task I'm solving. Moreover it seems like the generalizability of this task suffers because training this network to do this task may make it very good at only doing that specific task and the explainability of the decision making goes out of the window because it is black box. Additionally doesn't more parameters mean requiring more data to train the model? I don't see much use from such network architectures. However, I do see the applications in machine translation where you simply train the encoder and decoder to the target language at the same time with a single loss function. It seems useful there, but maybe not so much in robotics.\n Can someone tell me their thoughts on end-to-end architectures?

          "description": "this is mostly a cross-post from r/rust as my initial attempt failed because of some external links\n We've first announced Candle, a minimalist ML framework in Rust 6 weeks ago. Since then we've focused on adding various recent models and improved the framework so as to support the necessary features in an efficient way. You can checkout a gallery of the examples, supported models include:\n  \nLarge language models: LLaMA, LLaMA v2, Falcon, Phi-v1.5, StarCoder.\n Quantized models with the llama.cpp approach: LLaMA, T5, Phi-v1.5.\n Image generation: Stable Diffusion, Wuerstchen.\n Computer Vision: DINOv2, yolo-v3, yolo-v8, Segment-Anything Model.\n Text-to-speech: Whisper.\n  \nOne of the big upside of the pure Rust approach is that models can run directly in the browser using WASM, these can be accessed through this collection, you can try out Yolo, Whisper, Segment-Anything, T5, Llama2-c from your web browser.\n Finally, in order to present a use case where Candle has unique capabilities, we've built a quantized version of the recently released Phi-v1.5 LLM. You can try it out with the following command, this uses a q4k quantized model resulting in very fast inference on CPU while still producing pretty nice texts.\n $ cargo run --example phi --release -- \\ --prompt \"Explain how to find the median of an array and write the corresponding python function.\\nAnswer:\" \\ --quantized --sample-len 200 Explain how to find the median of an array and write the corresponding python function. Answer: The median is the middle value in an array. If the array has an even number of elements, the median is the average of the two middle values. def median(arr): arr.sort() n = len(arr) if n % 2 == 0: return (arr[n//2 - 1] + arr[n//2]) / 2 else: return arr[n//2] \n It's still very early days for Candle so please let us know if you start using it and run into some rough edges.

All the other pre trained models have failed me so far.\n I went onto Tensorflow official forum / Stackoverflow / Tensorflow github with specific error messages that I am getting on Ubuntu with Nvidia card / Mac M2 and there has been absolute radio silence in response to multiple posts over last month. Found many open issues listed since 2020 on the same line as mine i.e. identical error messages that people have come across.\n Finally after about a month of being on TF forum, I direct messaged an official TF2 dev who kindly responded with answers. I haven't succeeded yet with any of the pre trained model from the official section. Only one model from research section is working so far for me i.e. Faster_rcnn_resnet_50_640x640 ..\n Thus the question. Kindly help me enlighten myself with where is this thing headed.

Tasks like migrating APIs or updating dependencies require complex edits across files. I explored a new approach from Microsoft Research to automate these \"repository-level\" coding challenges with AI.\n Their new paper proposes CodePlan - an AI system that breaks repository tasks into incremental steps guided by planning & analysis.\n Key points:\n  \nUses LLMs like GPT-3 for localized code edits\n Maintains validity across repository via incremental analysis\n Adaptively plans multi-step changes based on code dependencies\n Significantly outperformed baselines on API migration & temporal edits\n Automated tasks across 168 file C# codebase\n 2-3x more accurate edit locations than baselines\n Produced final valid codebases, unlike reactive approaches\n  \nThe core insight is combining LLM strengths with rigorous planning based on dependency analysis. This automates interdependent code changes that naive LLM use struggles with (I personally have these kinds of issues all the time with GPT4 - lack of context about the entirety of the repo/how files fit together).\n I think CodePlan demonstrates AI can expand beyond small coding assists into large-scale engineering tasks. Planning + LLMs > LLMs alone. This could really improve productivity and code quality... at least for me :)\n Full summary.

But it stopped working as soon as my baby started sleeping on his stomach, and started using blankets. The original version relied on anatomical features being visible.\n This version delivers the ability to train a blank slate SVM binary classifier on pictures of a user's baby, making it extremely biased (and resilient) to the custom behaviors the user's baby exhibits (blanket covering baby, teddy bear/other objects in crib, etc.). All generated data stays on your machine, nothing leaves the LAN.\n Video: https://youtu.be/8i0wHA_knKc?si=uhA4PpOYP0jMKLz1\n For obvious reasons I didn't have a dataset of babies sleeping.. so I wrapped a python/flask service with a React app which lets a user press a button to train the model w/ a new image from the camera's live stream. Then this model is invoked over time (+ other heuristics) to determine whether your baby is present and sleeping.\n I believe it works better than $300+ systems sold on the market, open sourced it: https://github.com/calebolson123/BabySleepCoach\n ​\n I'm thinking a fun next step for this project could be to apply privateGPT on the feature-engineered sleep records for a true \"Sleep Coach\"\n    submitted by    /u/GoochCommander  \n [link]   [comments]",

Since graduating, I’ve worked ~2 years as an ML engineer in small company(Niche area, different than research).\n I’ve done quite well here and have played a critical role in taking several big greenfield projects to completion. \n Most of my work is framing problems, understanding what’s possible with current research, then building the data pipelines, and training models(with small mods here and there). My main worry is that I might be approaching a point where there won’t be any more problems I’m capable of solving here. I’d imagine I’d hit the same wall at any future company with my current skill set.\n I’d like to continue working in CV/Graphics/Perception if possible, but I’d also like to be realistic about the competitiveness of this particular subfield and my general ability.\n I’ve been trying to up-skill and am struggling to self study MVG by Hartley and Zisserman. I’m also looking into OMCS to review low-level programming - maybe I can transition to optimizing ml/cv algorithms?\n It hit me recently that I don’t really know what to study/what I’d benefit from learning.

Some examples shown include counting objects or segmenting items in pictures using other tools.\n With this approach, existing models can be made multi-modal! Pretty cool.\n Full summary.

And the data points x when dot producting with w outputting c are the points which are in the hyperplane due to the coordinates representation of x wrt origin.\n So points in the hyperplane are the points which when performing dot product with w equals 0 when the coordinates is defined wrt origin that lie in the hyperplane is equivalent to the points which when performing dot product with w equals c when the coordinates is defined wrt original origin (0) or (0,0) or ...\n    submitted by    /u/Emotional-Fox-4285  \n [link]   [comments]",

Previous research gathered human preference data and then aligned the pre-trained models using reinforcement learning or instruction tuning, the so-called finetuning step. In contrast, aligning frozen LLMs without any extra data is more appealing. This work explores the potential of the latter setting. We discover that by integrating self-evaluation and rewind mechanisms, unaligned LLMs can directly produce responses consistent with human preferences via self-boosting. We introduce a novel inference method, Rewindable Auto-regressive INference (RAIN), that allows pre-trained LLMs to evaluate their own generation and use the evaluation results to guid…",

          "description": "(I'm a Software Engineer who knows almost nothing about ML / NLP, so, apologies in advance if this doesn't make any sense.)\n I had a shower thought around if tokenization could incorporate meaning, so the models could be trained on \"thoughts\" instead of subword tokens (which is probably closer to how we humans think). To expand a little bit, we could first cluster all the words (maybe using the current day LLMs), then each token (or \"thought\") in the new scheme could represent a group of related words, followed by refinements that would be less and less important.\n For example, (cop_thought, cop_refinement) -> cop, but (cop_thought, police_refinement) -> police etc.\n So the encoding step would involve an LLM (which could possibly be relatively smaller), whose output would go to the actual model but the decoding would still be fairly straightforward. This could possibly free up some additional capacity in the actual model, assuming this heavy lifting tokenization makes its job easier, but as I'm typing it, I guess I'm simply moving some of the semantic understand happening in the hidden layers of the current day LLMs explicitly to the tokenization (encoding) step, which may not really change anything (if not make it worse).\n I'm still curious what folks think, if there's any related efforts (and all the ways I'm wrong -- https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Cunningham%27s_Law).

          "description": "I've been reading the HyperDreamBooth paper and am confused about the number of parameters and corresponding matrix shapes in section 4.1 and figure 3 (below).\n ​\n Figure 3 from the paper\n Maybe there's something more than just matrix multiplication, because the numbers don't add up. If there are two matrices, A & B, of size n,r and r,m, and r = 1, and you multiply them, then it implies that n + m = 386k, which seems to be a bit much for a number of parameters in a single layer.\n Then we have two matrices of size a,r and r,b, where a = 100, b = 50 and there are 28k variables, according to the figure - in 4.1 they say 30k. If there's 30k, that would imply r = 200, for matrices of shape 100,200 and 200,50.\n I guess 386k and 28k are for the whole models, n and m differ from layer to layer, and r stays at one. Quite surprising to me that approximating a n,m shaped matrix with a product of n,1 and 1,m vectors would work. Even more surprising that apparently you could squeeze it further to 100,1 and 50,1. \n    submitted by    /u/Foxtr0t  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hey everyone!\n Multi-part question.\n  \nI have scraped text (I repeat, text, and not structured data such as tables or something) from a medical site, and I want to know how to clean it. And when I say clean, I don't mean removal of html tags and such. I already have the paragraphs in plain text but there is a lot of spammy stuff like \"You are not signed in; subscribe to this newsletter; by checking this box, I agree to the terms and conditions, etc.\" This text is not the exact same in all the paragraphs but there is high similarity. I would have thought there would be many tools to clean text and remove unrelated chunks like these but all I have been able to find has to do with cleaning html tags, changing date-time format and so on. Am I missing something or is this actually difficult?\n  \nSecondly, the spammy text I mentioned is from just one site. I will be eventually scaling to many sites and god knows what random text I'll have to clean then.\n  \nI used OpenAI embeddings and cosine similarity on the medical text to find similar paragraphs. The results were not great. Is there a way to improve the similarity search? I will be trying FAISS next but wanted to know what else I can do. It was suggested to me to use a pretrained embedding model specific to medical data. However, I found only one such model which is 20 gigs!\n  \nI'm just getting started with these, so, appreciate any help I can get.\n Thanks a ton!\n    submitted by    /u/yipra97  \n [link]   [comments]",

Check it out here: https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.11568\n It distills our recipe for training SOTA LLMs:\n  \nAn extensively deduplicated dataset: SlimPajama \n Hyperparameter search using muP \n Variable sequence length training + ALiBi \n Aggressive LR decay \n  \nOur BTLM-3B-8K not only sets a new standard for 3B parameter models but also frequently surpasses the performance of 7B models! In the paper, we meticulously outline how we developed the BTLM model and conducted a comprehensive analysis of its performance on 22 validation benchmarks. These benchmarks span a range of capabilities including common sense reasoning, world knowledge, reading comprehension, code generation, long sequence interpolation/extrapolation, bias, toxicity, and misinformation.\n For those eager to dive in, we've made our SlimPajama dataset and the BTLM-3B-8K model available on Hugging Face: https://huggingface.co/cerebras 🎉\n Feel free to delve into the details, explore the dataset and model, and let us know your thoughts, insights, or questions!

Researchers are looking for ways to train these large AI models without needing Google-scale resources.\n A new paper proposes LongLoRA, a fine-tuning approach that can extend LLaMA2 7B to 100k context length and 70B model to 32k context length on a single 8× A100 machine.\n Here are my highlights from the paper:\n Big one of course: LongLoRA efficiently fine-tunes large AI models on longer texts\n Key points:\n  \nApproximates standard attention via \"shift short attention\" during training\n Tuning only a subset of weights (LoRA) plus some embeddings & norms\n Fine-tuned 7B parameter model on 100k tokens with 1 machine\n Way lower training cost than full fine-tuning for large contexts\n Close to full fine-tuning performance\n  \nThe core insight is that an approximation of full attention enables efficient training while retaining standard attention for final inference. Combined with selective weight tuning, this really reduces compute needs.\n I think this demonstrates the potential to train more capable AI without unreasonable resources.

Say Program A last for 50 minutes, Program B is 30 minutes, etc.\n Each project manager has qualifications on what program he/she can handle. This constraint is a hard constraint.\n Time slots start from 6AM to 6PM. This means that if Program A which lasts for 30 minutes is assigned to start at 6:00AM, then it will end at 6:30AM. Only one program can be assigned in each station, so there should be no overlap in programs in terms of day and time per station.\n There is a forecasting model that takes a…",

This makes training RNN for long sequence usually takes long time compared to other architecture classes (like CNN).\n What we present is an algorithm based on Newton's method to evaluate and train RNN in parallel. In one of our experiment, we can achieve >1000x faster evaluation of a small GRU compared to common sequential method on a very long sequence. Training RNNs with our algorithm could also be more than 10x faster than training with sequential method.\n However, it's not without flaws.

Because all the logic is offloaded to users’ devices, data never leaves and there is no risk of it being used for finetuning by third parties.\n For now, we only support inference with LaMini-Flan-T5, so you might see modest performance. We plan to integrate Microsoft phi-1.5 for better performance once the 370M is out.\n We are also working on LlamaIndex-TS integration on the client side to have in-browser RAG for local querying of private documents.\n As our roadmap is quite dense, with RAG, internet search, improved inference, we welcome warmly contributors!

But model size must match dataset size.\n There are tradeoffs between model scale, data size, and compression performance. More data enables bigger models.\n Tokenization (like BPE) generally hurts compression slightly by making prediction harder.\n Longer contexts let models exploit more sequential dependencies.\n  \nImplications:\n  \nModels have learned very general capabilities beyond just text. Their strong compression reflects deep understanding of images, audio etc statistically.\n I got some new perspective on model scaling laws and links between prediction and generalization.\n There's potential for practical applications compressing images, video etc. But large model size an issue.\n Overall it shows these models are very capable general purpose learners, not just for language.\n  \nFull summary here if you want more details.

          "description": "I've been playing around with transformers since following Karpathy's shakespeare model on youtube and found it really cool. Thought I should write a Tree-of-Thoughts model as my next project which will be somewhat similar, given what we're doing is learning the meaning behind words and phrases and then using that knowledge to generate a sequence based on a seed token or sequence of tokens.\n Here's how I was thinking it should go: I write a next token in sequence prediction model and write a generate function that generates a sequence of tokens on top of a seed token. Then I write a tree model that takes in whatever this bigram has learned and adds onto it some kind of knowledge about where one thought about the seed has been generated and stop there. Then iteratively generate a few more such thoughts based on the same seed.\n This is how I initially thought it would go but now when I'm writing, I've already written the bigram(next token prediction and generation), I don't know what to do next. I am kind of stuck.\n It will be interesting to see how you, if you've ever written a similar model or are good at NLP, would attempt this. Looking at a variety of different approaches to the same problem I am trying to solve would be great.\n So I decided to post here. Would be great to hear from you guys!\n    submitted by    /u/GraphicsMonster  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hello everyone\n I have a doubt regarding GANs for tabular data, more specifically for time-series generation. Looking at the TimeGAN paper (code) and other implementations such as the one by YData, considering that the training dataset is divided into slices (like a rolling window) of N length and that the generated sequence will follow the same format, that is [batch size, N, n_features], what we are effectively generating are slices and not a fully synthetic time-series.\n ​\n To clarify my question, the output of a TimeGAN is only a set of slices, although there is no guarantee that generated slice(N-1) is the one before slice(N), and so the true use of a TimeGAN is generating slices that can be used to train a predictive TS model but not reconstructing a complete time series like the one used for training.\n ​\n I suspect that's the case (useful only to generate good slices for training predictive models) as there is no fully generated time series in the paper or any of the codes, while the quality of the generated data is partially measured by training a model on original data and generated data and comparing their predictive performance. If anyone can confirm/develop upon these thoughts I would be extremely grateful.\n    submitted by    /u/iReallyReadiT  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Project Page\n Paper\n Code \n Abstract:\n  \nEvent cameras offer many advantages over standard cameras due to their distinctive principle of operation: low power, low latency, high temporal resolution and high dynamic range. Nonetheless, the success of many downstream visual applications also hinges on an efficient and effective scene representation, where Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) is seen as the leading candidate. Such promise and potential of event cameras and NeRF inspired recent works to investigate on the reconstruction of NeRF from moving event cameras. However, these works are mainly limited in terms of the dependence on dense and low-noise event streams, as well as generalization to arbitrary contrast threshold values and camera speed profiles. In this work, we propose Robust e-NeRF, a novel method to directly and robustly reconstruct NeRFs from moving event cameras under various real-world conditions, especially from sparse and noisy events generated under non-uniform motion. It consists of two key components: a realistic event generation model that accounts for various intrinsic parameters (e.g. time-independent, asymmetric threshold and refractory period) and non-idealities (e.g. pixel-to-pixel threshold variation), as well as a complementary pair of normalized reconstruction losses that can effectively generalize to arbitrary speed profiles and intrinsic parameter values without such prior knowledge. Experiments on real and novel realistically simulated sequences verify our effectiveness. Our code, synthetic dataset and improved event simulator are public.\n  \n   submitted by    /u/Sirisian  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hi all.\n I have been tinkering with a project to get quicker learning for CNNs. \n The idea came after reading the SDProp paper. Algorithms using adaptive learning rate can be interpeted as muliplying the gradient(with or without momentum) with the inverse square-root of the covariance matrix. Using a diagonal estimate of the covariance matrix.\n Which begs the question: what happens if we use a fuller estimate? I chose to include covariances between the elements of convolutional filters. I.e. a conv.weight of size [n_out,n_in,5,5] needs a tensor of size [n_out,n_int,25,25] to store its contribution to the covariance matrix.\n for 3x3 filters and 5x5 filters, torch.linalg.eigh could be used to calculate the square root of the covariance matrices. For 7x7, I used newtons method to approximate the square root.\n In the figure below are some results for a 6 layer CNN on CIFAR 100. Huge gains iteration for iteration. But is it quicker? Not a lot. A bit for the smaller 3x3 filter. More optimizations could still be made. And it will obviously depend on network architecture and computer hardware. \n I'm sure there could be some use-cases. The computation of the square-root calculations is invariant to batch_size and image_size (unless number of filters also is increased).\n If anyone is interested I can also link to my torch implementation of the optimizer, once I get it up on github.\n Not sure if this, or something like it, has been done before?

Our aim is to use this sensor data to predict changes in specific biomarkers over time. The data's tensor shape is B,T,F,C, where:\n  \nB = batch size\n T = sequence length\n F = sampled frequencies\n C = features at each frequency\n  \nCurrently, my approach involves flattening this tensor to B,T,−1 and then feeding it to a transformer model. While this has yielded reasonable results, I'm contemplating whether there are more effective ways to prepare the data for the transformer model.\n Here are my specific concerns:\n  \nFlattening the tensor might dilute the information specific to each frequency across various features.\n I could potentially miss the chance to capture frequency-related variations within the features.\n  \nTo address these, I've considered a few options:\n  \nSelf-attention over individual features or frequencies: Although this could be effective, it might make the model too large given my medium-sized dataset.\n Using convolutional layers: Preliminary experiments with this approach have not led to any significant improvements.\n  \nI'm particularly interested in any thoughts on how to make my transformer more receptive to the multi-dimensional nature of my dataset. Increasing the number of attention heads to better accommodate all features is also on the table.\n Does anyone have any insights or can point me to relevant papers or codebases for handling such multi-dimensional data with transformers?\n Thank you for your help!\n    submitted by    /u/BiomedEngineer_  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Paper: https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.08351\n ​\n  \nSelf-supervised pre-training of language models usually consists in predicting probability distributions over extensive token vocabularies. In this study, we propose an innovative method that shifts away from probability prediction and instead focuses on reconstructing input embeddings in a contrastive fashion via Constrastive Weight Tying (CWT). We apply this approach to pretrain Headless Language Models in both monolingual and multilingual contexts. Our method offers practical advantages, substantially reducing training computational requirements by up to 20 times, while simultaneously enhancing downstream performance and data efficiency. We observe a significant +1.6 GLUE score increase and a notable +2.7 LAMBADA accuracy improvement compared to classical LMs within similar compute budgets.\n  \n​\n Comparison of our approach vs. classical MLM within same compute budgets\n The Contrastive Weight Tying approach\n ​\n    submitted by    /u/nthngdy  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Rethinking the Role of PPO in RLHF\n\nTL;DR: In RLHF, there’s tension between the reward learning phase, which uses human preference in the form of comparisons, and the RL fine-tuning phase, which optimizes a single, non-comparative reward. What if we performed RL in a comparative way?\nFigure 1:\n This diagram illustrates the difference between reinforcement learning from absolute feedback and relative feedback. By incorporating a new component - pairwise policy gradient, we can unify the reward modeling stage and RL stage, enabling direct updates based on pairwise responses.\n\n\n\nLarge Language Models (LLMs) have powered increasingly capable virtual assistants, such as GPT-4, Claude-2, Bard and Bing Chat. These systems can respond to complex user queries, write code, and even produce poetry. T…",

          "description": "Brain decoding tech has improved a lot recently thanks to AI/ML, enabling reading out visual perceptions from fMRI brain scans. But fMRI is too slow for real-time BCIs.\n A new study from Meta's AI research team pushes brain reading into real-time using MEG, which measures whole-brain activity at super-fast millisecond resolution.\n They built a 3-part pipeline to decode MEG signals:\n  \nEmbed images into latent spaces using pretrained models like CLIP.\n Train MEG-specific ConvNet to predict embeddings from MEG data.\n Generate images from MEG embeddings with diffusion model.\n  \nThey tested it on 20k+ natural images. MEG decoding was 7X better than old methods, hitting 70% top-5 accuracy in retrieving the right images.\n Generated images matched semantics decently but lacked fine visual details compared to fMRI. MEG seems more focused on high-level category info whereas fMRI captures more low-level features.\n This could enable visual BCIs for paralysis, etc. ... honestly, a world where we can decode brain images in real time is pretty crazy. The findings also raise some important ethical considerations around privacy of decoded mental content... (wow, that was a weird sentence to write!).\n TLDR: New MEG pipeline decodes dynamic visual data from brain activity in real-time. Good but not yet photorealistic-quality image generation.\n Full summary here. Paper is here.\n    submitted by    /u/Successful-Western27  \n [link]   [comments]",

Higher end cards are faster, but their disproportionate cost makes them more expensive per word spoken.\n The model’s median speed is surprisingly similar across GPU types, even though the peak performance can be quite different.\n No matter what GPU you select, you should be prepared for significant variability in performance.\n Qualitative: While bark’s speech is often impressively natural sounding, it does have a tendency to go off script sometimes.\n  \nWe’ve also made available audio from 1000 top-rated recipes, paired with the script it was trying to read.\n    submitted by    /u/SaladChefs  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I've had access to Dall-3, Vision and voice chat features, and I've been blown away by how impressive each of the new features are. Dall-E 3 seems roughly comparable to Midjourney in overall image quality, but does a much better job at understanding the prompt. The vision model continues to surprise by how well it is able to understand images at a seemingly human level of comprehension. And the voice chat is such an intuitive and captivating way of interacting with ChatGPT, it felt like I was interacting with one of the AI assistants from the movie \"Her\".\n However, it's unfortunate that these amazing new features cannot be used together at the same time. Up until gaining access to these features, I had been using the advanced data analysis model as my default, which is great for helping with programming tasks. I can only imagine how revolutionary ChatGPT will be when a cohesive multi-modal model is released sometime in the near future which has all these capabilities available from the start.\n What things would you want to try if such a cohesive model was released? I can already imagine some use cases where you could set up iterative improvement for things like interface design, which some people have already got to work with just the base vision model by itself.\n    submitted by    /u/ImRealNow  \n [link]   [comments]",

The CFA exams rigorously test practical finance knowledge and are known for being quite difficult.\n They tested the models in zero-shot, few-shot, and chain-of-thought prompting settings on mock Level I and Level II exams.\n The key findings:\n  \nGPT-4 consistently beat ChatGPT, but both models struggled way more on the more advanced Level II questions.\n Few-shot prompting helped ChatGPT slightly\n Chain-of-thought prompting exposed knowledge gaps rather than helping much.\n Based on estimated passing scores, only GPT-4 with few-shot prompting could potentially pass the exams.\n  \nThe models definitely aren't ready to become charterholders yet. Their difficulties with tricky questions and core finance concepts highlight the need for more specialized training and knowledge.\n But GPT-4 did better overall, and few-shot prompting shows their ability to improve. So with targeted practice on finance formulas and reasoning, we could maybe see step-wise improvements.\n TLDR: Tested on mock CFA exams, ChatGPT and GPT-4 struggle with the complex finance concepts and fail. With few-shot prompting, GPT-4 performance reaches the boundary between passing and failing but doesn't clearly pass.\n Full summary here.

          "description": "Game dev is super complex nowadays - games have huge codebases, massive teams, and dev cycles dragging on for years. Costs are insane too - budgets can hit $100M+ easily.\n In a new paper, researchers propose to reverse this trend with an AI framework called GameGPT that automates parts of the dev process using multiple AI agents. Each agent handles a different role (all are fine-tuned from relevant base models):\n  \nOne agent reviews the game design plan to catch errors\n Another turns tasks into code implementations\n Reviewer agents check the code and results\n A testing agent validates everything works as expected\n  \nBy breaking up the workflow, GameGPT can simplify things for the AI agents. They just focus on a narrow role versus having one jack-of-all-trades agent.\n The authors argue GameGPT can eliminate repetitive and rote elements of gamedev like testing. This would free up developers to focus on creative design challenges.\n However, the GameGPT paper does not include any concrete results or experiments demonstrating improved performance. There is no evidence presented that GameGPT reduces hallucinations, redundancy or development time. The authors mention empirical results support their claims that the architecture is more effective, but none are provided. I could not find any additional support material about this work, like a project website, that I could use to further check into this (maybe someone can share in the comments?).\n Right now GameGPT seems mostly conceptual. The ideas are interesting but hard to assess without quantitative results.\n TLDR: New GameGPT AI framework aims to automate tedious parts of game development using specialized agents. No concrete results were provided in the paper - someone will need to test this out and report back.\n Full summary here. Paper is here.\n    submitted by    /u/Successful-Western27  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Today's conversational bots like Claude and GPT can chat impressively but aren't great at complex planning or executing technical tasks. To overcome this, new research from HKU builds open-source AI agents that blend natural language and coding skills. They're called Lemur and Lemur-Chat.\n The researchers think achieving versatile real-world agents requires models that integrate both fluid natural language abilities and precise programming language control. Humans combine plain speech for higher-level goals with languages like Python when we need to plan intricately and execute exactly. AI needs both capacities too.\n But most existing models specialize in pure language or pure code. There's a separation that is limiting.\n The team created Lemur by pretraining the open-source Llama-2 on a massive mixed corpus with 10x more natural language than code. This improved its programming abilities while retaining conversational strength. Further instruction tuning optimized Lemur-Chat for following free-form directions in language.\n Experiments found Lemur surpassed specialized coding-only models like Codex in overall benchmarks. Lemur-Chat then exceeded Lemur by 15% after instruction tuning.\n More importantly, Lemur-Chat won 12/13 new \"agent tests\" designed to mimic real-world challenges needing both language and programming prowess.\n It beat alternatives at:\n  \nUsing tools like Python and Wikipedia to enhance reasoning\n Debugging code by leveraging error messages\n Improving the most from natural language feedback\n Exploring partially observable environments like cybersecurity and web browsing simulations.\n  \nLemur-Chat matched GPT-3.5 in many tests, closing the gap between commercial and open-source agents.\n TLDR: New open-source AI agents combine coding and language skills. Experiments show the combo unlocks more performance across technical challenges.\n Full summary is here. Paper is here.\n    submitted by    /u/Successful-Western27  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Top dating apps Tinder, Hinge and Bumble have all stated that they're already investing in AI to make their apps better. They're using it to verify profiles, match people based on bios and interests, and help generate profile descriptions and liven conversations. But what about machine learning on user photos?\n iris Dating uses AI to analyze user input in the form of liking or disliking faces (\"swiping\" profiles). We all know if we like blondes or brunettes, blue or brown eyes, short or long hair, beard or no beard, etc. But AI can pick up the subtlest features (proportions, distances, curvatures etc.) and build a face map. A matrix of features, if you will. It doesn't just look for a person looking like your favorite celebrity crush. It understands what you're really attracted to.\n From there it's an easy path: if it knows which features attract me, it can predict my level of attraction to a specific individual (specifically, their face). Find the persons with the highest predicted attractiveness (for me, not for everyone), rank them by attraction for me, and we have a potential high mutual attraction match. The two stats I have are that on average women like 55%(!) of the profiles iris picks for them; and that users have 40x higher chances of matching when they've trained the model to understand their taste.\n I know it takes a lot more than a pretty face to make for a great relationship, but it sure doesn't hurt to start with strong physical attraction. Missed connections on Craigslist are about just that: seeing a face you can't forget. Find me more of these \"wow\" faces and let's go from there.\n What do you think? Is it too early? Too bold? Too niche?\n    submitted by    /u/akahamlet  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Transformers are great at NLP and computer vision tasks, but I was surprised to learn they still lag behind simple linear models at time series forecasting.\n The issue is how most Transformer architectures treat each timestamp as a token and fuse all the variable data from that moment. This makes two big problems:\n  \nVariables recorded at slightly different times get blurred together, losing important timing info\n Each token can only see a single moment, no long-term dependencies\n  \nSo Transformers struggle to extract useful patterns and correlations from the data.\n Some researchers from Tsinghua University took a fresh look at this and realized the Transformer components themselves are solid, they just need to flip the architecture for time series data.\n Their \"Inverted Transformer\" (or iTransformer):\n  \nMakes each variable's full history into a token, instead of each timestamp\n Uses self-attention over variables to capture relationships\n Processes time dependencies per variable with feedforward layers\n  \nThis simple tweak gives all the benefits we want:\n  \nState-of-the-art forecasting accuracy, beating both linear models and standard Transformers\n Better generalization to unseen variables\n Increased interpretability\n Ability to leverage longer historical context\n  \nTLDR: Inverting Transformers to align with time series structure allows them to outperform alternatives in working with time series data.\n Full summary.

          "description": "Multimodal sentiment analysis combines text, audio and video to understand human emotions. But extra inputs can add irrelevant or conflicting signals. So filtering matters.\n Researchers made a \"Adaptive Language-guided Multimodal Transformer\" (ALMT) that uses text to guide filtering of visual and audio data. This creates a \"hyper-modality\" with less noise that complements the text.\n They tested it on datasets like MOSI (YouTube reviews), MOSEI (YouTube clips) and CH-SIMS (Chinese videos). ALMT achieved improved accuracy:\n  \nMOSI: YouTube movie reviews with 2,199 samples. ALMT achieves state-of-the-art performance on various metrics including 6% higher 7-class accuracy.\n MOSEI: 22,856 YouTube clips covering sentiment-rich scenarios. ALMT improves multi-class accuracy by 3-5% over previous methods.\n CH-SIMS: Chinese dataset with over 2,000 video samples. ALMT surpasses prior work by 1.4% in binary accuracy.\n  \nAnalyses showed big drops in performance without the guided filtering, so this validates that it's the main innovation.\n Downsides are it needs lots of training data and has minor gains on sparse regression metrics. But overall the technique of filtering multimodal data under text guidance gives improvements.\n The concepts feel intuitive - use dominant signals to filter others and retain useful complements. My guess is it would transfer well to other multimodal tasks.\n TLDR: New way to filter multimodal data for sentiment analysis using text guidance improves performance. Shows the value in removing distracting signals. Sometimes less is more.\n Full summary here. Paper is here.\n    submitted by    /u/Successful-Western27  \n [link]   [comments]",

I wear many hats in my job and it's a lot of responsibility.\n One way I've attempted to tame the complexity is by using good reference books. I've accumulated quite the collection through the years. Some print others digital. I've also got a lot of digital notes. And that's a lot of data.\n I've been playing around with sharly.ai (thanks to this sub for recommending) and uploading documents to it and querying them. Its been able to find the information every time it's been available. And more importantly it's provided sources and page numbers. This is important, since I've never been able to find a conversational AI that gives me consistently good answers (including the latest chatgpt), and I always need to read deeper. I also need to backup my work. So in this way it's basically a super index.\n I also bought a tablet for note-taking and basic sketches. The idea is to use the tablet to take notes, hold my library for reading, and interact with sharly.ai. \n Is this approach good enough, or is there something else I can do?\n    submitted by    /u/Aggressive_Ad_507  \n [link]   [comments]",

I like technical work but really am passionate about working with people and learning how to blend AI and nuclear eng. together. I would love to get feedback from people who work closely in this area to learn more!\n What makes an AI department successful?\n What careers offer lots of growth and opportunities for versatility?\n What does a strategic/leadership role look like in AI? What are the names of these careers?\n I don't get much exposure to AI specialists and there day to day. Thanks again for the feedback!\n    submitted by    /u/kastilyo  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I like Cities: Skylines, but struggle at building roundabouts. Turns out, despite being safer than intersections, they're also tricky to design in real life - small tweaks can ruin traffic flow.\n They're designed iteratively. This is a pain for developing countries without resources to test options. But AI could help auto-generate diverse and valid design options.\n In a new paper, researchers propose using Generative Flow Networks (GFlowNets) to sample varied roundabout layouts. Their approach works by constructing layouts step-by-step, maximizing rewards for realism, diversity, and safety.\n They also use a clever approximation during training. Rather than simulating traffic, they quickly check road intersections to focus the search (This sped up training by 200x).\n The authors tested their generated roundabout designs on simulated road scenarios of different complexity. Their model generated more diverse designs than rule-based or reinforcement learning approaches while maintaining realism and traffic flow.\n Plus, as road connections increased, the model kept discovering novel options without compromising quality.\n I thought this paper was an awesome proof-of-concept for auto-generating better roundabouts with AI, and I especially liked the authors' angle of leveraging this technology to specifically help developing countries. This could help them design higher-quality transportation networks faster and cheaper. \n TLDR: Roundabouts are costly to design. New paper demonstrates how AI can generate diverse, valid roundabout designs quickly to cut costs and raise quality. Helpful for infrastructure in developing countries.\n Full summary here. Paper is here.\n    submitted by    /u/Successful-Western27  \n [link]   [comments]",

There are strong arguments to be made on both sides.\n Those who believe that Israel should negotiate a two-state solution argue that it is the only way to achieve lasting peace in the region. They point out that the Palestinians have a legitimate right to self-determination and that a two-state solution would respect that right.

          "description": "Artificial Intelligence could revolutionize personalized healthcare in a way that significantly enhances our sense of well-being. Think about an AI-driven \"Well-being Advisor\" that integrates real-time biometric data from wearables, genetic information, and your medical history to create a fully personalized health and well-being plan. This goes beyond counting steps or monitoring heart rate; it would make real-time recommendations for diet, exercise, and stress management, and could even predict and prevent potential health issues before they become serious.\n Moreover, it would adapt based on your feedback and other contextual factors. For instance, if you're stressed because of a work deadline, it could suggest specific breathing exercises, time management techniques, or even a particular type of short workout to boost your focus and reduce stress. This isn't a one-size-fits-all approach; it's tailored wellness backed by data science.\n Furthermore, this AI advisor could interface with your home automation system. Based on your current state, it could adjust the lighting, play music to elevate your mood, or even communicate with your smart fridge to suggest meals that you can make with the ingredients you have—meals that align with your health goals for that specific day.\n This AI-driven approach can add a highly personalized, proactive layer to healthcare and well-being, making wellness an integrated part of your daily life rather than something you think about during a yearly check-up or after you're already sick. It would make the pursuit of well-being a more interactive, data-driven experience.\n CGPT-4\n View Poll\n    submitted by    /u/Georgeo57  \n [link]   [comments]",

English prompts were blocked over 99% of the time, for comparison.\n The study benchmarked attacks across 12 diverse languages and categories:\n  \nHigh-resource: English, Chinese, Arabic, Hindi\n Mid-resource: Ukrainian, Bengali, Thai, Hebrew\n Low-resource: Zulu, Scots Gaelic, Hmong, Guarani\n  \nThe low-resource languages showed serious vulnerability to generating harmful responses, with combined attack success rates of around 79%. Mid-resource language success rates were much lower at 22%, while high-resource languages showed minimal vulnerability at around 11% success.\n Attacks worked as well as state-of-the-art techniques without needing adversarial prompts.\n These languages are used by 1.2 billion speakers today and allows easy exploitation by translating prompts. The English-centric focus misses vulnerabilities in other languages.\n TLDR: Bypassing safety in AI chatbots is easy by translating prompts to low-resource languages (like Zulu, Scots Gaelic, Hmong, and Guarani).

          "description": "Artificial Intelligence can revolutionize weight loss through personalized health optimization. Imagine an AI system that integrates real-time biometric data from wearables with deep learning algorithms. This system would analyze everything: your heart rate, sleep patterns, stress levels, and even blood markers. Based on this data, it would construct a dynamically evolving, tailor-made regimen for diet, exercise, and sleep.\n But it doesn't stop there. By harnessing natural language processing, this AI could act as a 24/7 personal coach. It could provide real-time feedback during workouts, recommend meals when you're dining out, and even gently nudge you when it detects emotional eating triggers. If you’re in the grocery store, it could guide your choices, pushing you towards nutritious options that align with your current health metrics.\n The effectiveness here isn't just the personalization, but the adaptability. The AI adjusts its recommendations as it learns more about you, essentially evolving in real-time to your body's responses. It’s all about creating a seamless, intuitive experience that removes the burden of planning, decision-making, and self-monitoring from the individual, making weight loss more achievable than ever.\n By focusing on this comprehensive, data-driven approach, AI can eliminate much of the guesswork and emotional burden from weight loss, leading to more sustainable and effective outcomes.\n CGPT-4\n    submitted by    /u/Georgeo57  \n [link]   [comments]",

The world as we know it is in a drastic shift, and it's hard to think of what it's going to become, and so many cling to hopeful ideas that give promises.\n AGI/Singularity doesn't have a grounding basis in evidence, or research. It's all theoretics, and the foundation for each technology is quite weak. You see, the mind is a sensorial parsing relational network. All of our sensorial experience is incorporated into a world-model, and thus it begins to rationalize, and be lucid of the environment. I don't think it's possible to re-create this kind of experience with a linear instruction set, let alone neuromorphic computing, or wetware. Each has to be built from the bottom-up with immense precision, and thus far we don't understand the mind.\n Realistically speaking everything is consciousness, and integrating that idea is the only way forward.\n tl;dr Replicating cognition is a completely theoretical endeavor, and requires vast amounts of understanding in regards to the nature of reality, not just the quantum, but the unique stochastic behavior of each higher-ordered system.\n    submitted by    /u/lucy_chxn  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "In the context of maximizing positive impact, AI has transformative potential in healthcare. Let's start with personalized medicine. AI can analyze vast data sets, consisting of genetic, environmental, and lifestyle variables, to tailor medical treatments for individuals. This level of personalization could substantially increase treatment effectiveness and reduce adverse side effects. We're not just talking about better pills; we're envisioning targeted gene therapies and custom-tailored interventions that could be more curative rather than merely palliative.\n Beyond personalization, AI can democratize healthcare access. Remote areas without specialists could have AI systems that diagnose and recommend treatments, making quality healthcare accessible without the need for extensive travel. Telemedicine could be supercharged by AI, offering medical consultations and second opinions to anyone with internet access.\n Moreover, AI could lead breakthroughs in drug discovery and epidemiology. It could analyze complex biochemical interactions at a speed unattainable by humans, slashing the time and cost to bring new drugs to market. On a larger scale, AI could monitor and model the spread of diseases, providing actionable insights for containment and treatment strategies.\n So, AI in healthcare is not merely an incremental improvement. It's a paradigm shift that could equalize healthcare access and significantly extend human life while improving its quality. All these advancements could happen within our lifetime, changing the face of medicine and, by extension, society.\n    submitted by    /u/Georgeo57  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Can LLMs actually improve their own reasoning by self-correcting mistakes? A new paper from DeepMind and the University of Illinois looks to answer this quantitatively.\n The results show that unaided, LLMs struggle at self-correction for reasoning tasks. The core issue is LLMs have trouble reliably evaluating the correctness of their own responses. They rarely identify flaws in initial reasoning. Sometimes LLMs even alter initially correct responses to become incorrect after self-correction! (I've personally seen this when interacting with ChatGPT many times and you probably have too).\n More complex techniques like critiquing between LLM instances don't help much either. External feedback or guidance looks necessary to improve reasoning (Well, some interesting parallels to this paper here about implicit improvement from preference data vs traditional RLHF).\n Self-correction does show promise for things like making responses more polite or safe though. Criteria there are more clear-cut.\n The authors argue we need to balance enthusiasm with realistic expectations on self-correction. It has a lot of limits for improving reasoning (at least with current models). But they suggest promising directions like incorporating high-quality external feedback from humans, training data, and tools. That could be key to unlocking self-correction's potential down the road.\n TLDR: Basically title... LLMs can't reliably self-correct reasoning yet. Maybe hybrid techniques combining self-correction with external guidance could work but we need more research.\n Full summary.

          "description": "LLMs keep getting more capable at generating natural language. But there's always room for improving the quality and alignment of their responses.\n Typically this requires lots of human effort to collect more training data. So researchers are exploring ways for models to self-improve without human involvement.\n Many methods use prompting - giving the LLM instructions to critique and refine its responses. But coming up with comprehensive prompts is challenging.\n The new approach proposed, called PIT, lets models learn self-improvement implicitly from human preference data instead. It reformulates reinforcement learning to maximize the gap between an original response and improved response conditioned on the original.\n This taps into the implicit guidance in the preference data on what constitutes better quality, so no manual rubrics are needed. PIT uses curriculum reinforcement learning - first improving easy references, then switching to the LLM's own samples.\n Experiments on real and synthetic datasets show PIT significantly outperforms prompting methods like Self-Refine. It improved response quality 7-34% across conditions without any human involvement.\n This demonstrates a promising direction for LLMs to align better with human preferences autonomously as they learn from experience. No need for human bottlenecks when expanding to new domains or underserved use cases. Very cool!\n TLDR: New method PIT enables LLMs to implicitly learn to refine themselves from human preference data, no prompts needed. Big improvement over prompting approaches.\n Full Summary\n Arxiv is here: https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.00898\n    submitted by    /u/Successful-Western27  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Video game voice actors are prepared to go on strike over the use of AI in game development.\n \nThe current contract negotiations between the Screen Actors Guild-American Federation of Television and Radio Artists (SAG-AFTRA) and video game companies have stalled, with the major issues being pay raises and the use of AI to alter or generate actors' performances.\n \nSAG-AFTRA wants protections for its members to ensure their work is not stolen or replaced by AI.\n \nIf negotiations don't progress, voice actors, stunt artists, and motion capture performers could potentially go on strike, leading to delays in game releases and recasting of beloved performers.\n \nThe voice actors' strike in 2016 resulted in improvements to pay, and now they are prepared to strike again to fight for their rights.\n \nVideo game performances are often seen as assets to be extracted and inserted into games, rather than recognizing the humanity and quality of life of the performers.\n \nThe use of AI in game development raises concerns about how companies will use advances in generative AI to steal work or put performers out of a job.\n \nSAG-AFTRA wants transparency, consent, and compensation when it comes to the use of AI in games.\n \nMembers of SAG-AFTRA have voted in favor of authorizing a strike, meaning voice actors, stunt artists, and motion capture performers could potentially join the picket line if negotiations don't progress.\n \nThe strike could lead to delays in upcoming game releases and the recasting of performers if companies refuse to meet the union's demands.\n \nThe fight for voice actors' rights is an existential one, as they want to retain the rights to their own voices and images and achieve wages that keep up with inflation\n \n Source : https://kotaku.com/sag-aftra-strike-voice-actor-spider-man-ai-union-1850874117\n    submitted by    /u/NuseAI  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "LLMs like GPT-3 struggle in streaming uses like chatbots because their performance tanks on long texts exceeding their training length. I checked out a new paper investigating why windowed attention fails for this.\n By visualizing the attention maps, the researchers noticed LLMs heavily attend initial tokens as \"attention sinks\" even if meaningless. This anchors the distribution.\n They realized evicting these sink tokens causes the attention scores to get warped, destabilizing predictions.\n Their proposed \"StreamingLLM\" method simply caches a few initial sink tokens plus recent ones. This tweaks LLMs to handle crazy long texts. Models tuned with StreamingLLM smoothly processed sequences with millions of tokens, and were up to 22x faster than other approaches. \n Even cooler - adding a special \"[Sink Token]\" during pre-training further improved streaming ability. The model just used that single token as the anchor. I think the abstract says it best:\n  \nWe introduce StreamingLLM, an efficient framework that enables LLMs trained with a finite length attention window to generalize to infinite sequence length without any fine-tuning. We show that StreamingLLM can enable Llama-2, MPT, Falcon, and Pythia to perform stable and efficient language modeling with up to 4 million tokens and more.\n  \nTLDR: LLMs break on long convos. Researchers found they cling to initial tokens as attention sinks. Caching those tokens lets LLMs chat infinitely.\n Full summary here\n Paper link: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.17453.pdf\n    submitted by    /u/Successful-Western27  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "When trying to get language models to solve complex math problems, researchers kept running into limits. Models like GPT-3 and ChatGPT still struggle with advanced algebra, calculus, and geometry questions. The math is just too abstract and symbol-heavy for them.\n To break through this barrier, researchers from Tsinghua University and Microsoft taught models to combine natural language reasoning with calling external math tools.\n The key is their new \"tool-integrated reasoning\" format. Models generate a natural language plan first, then write code to invoke tools like SymPy to solve equations. They take the output results and continue verbal reasoning.\n By interleaving natural language and symbolic computations, they get the best of both worlds - semantic understanding from language models and rigorous math from tools.\n They trained versions of the LLaMA model this way, producing their Tool-Integrated Reasoning Agent (TORA). They present some strong results:\n  \nIn evaluations on 10 math datasets, TORA substantially outperformed prior state-of-the-art methods, achieving 13-19% higher accuracy on average.\n On one competition test, TORA-7B scored 40% accuracy, beating the previous best model by 22 percentage points.\n  \nThis demonstrates that integrating tools directly into the reasoning process can significantly enhance mathematical capabilities, even for large models like GPT-4.\n However, tough problems involving geometry and advanced algebra are still there. New techniques for symbolic reasoning and spatial understanding will likely be needed to push further.\n Overall though, tool integration seems a promising path to improve reasoning skills. Applying this to other domains like logic and programming could also be impactful.\n TLDR: Teaching language models to use math tools helps them solve way more complex problems.\n Full Paper Summary\n arXiv Link\n    submitted by    /u/Successful-Western27  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "If an AI were to take on this task, it would primarily rely on data mining and natural language processing (NLP) techniques. First, the AI would scrape digital platforms to collect works authored by various people. Platforms could range from academic databases like PubMed or ArXiv to blogs, forums, and social media. The goal would be to capture a wide array of intellectual output, irrespective of the person's titles or accolades.\n Next, an NLP model would evaluate the collected content based on factors like originality, complexity, and coherence. Advanced sentiment analysis could be employed to gauge the depth of understanding and nuances in the arguments made. Specialized algorithms could also be developed to assess the impact of each piece of work, using metrics such as citations, social shares, or subsequent works that build upon it.\n The AI would then create a shortlist based on these evaluations. This stage might also involve unsupervised machine learning techniques like clustering to find patterns or commonalities among the top contenders.\n The final stage would be validation, possibly using reinforcement learning. The AI could simulate various scenarios or problems and predict how the content created by these individuals would contribute to solving them. It would then refine its list based on the simulated outcomes.\n This all-AI approach would drastically reduce human bias and could be executed relatively quickly. However, it's important to note that any such system would need to be designed carefully to avoid introducing biases present in the training data or algorithms.\n    submitted by    /u/Georgeo57  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "When visualizing the inner workings of vision transformers (ViTs), researchers noticed weird spikes of attention on random background patches. This didn't make sense since the models should focus on foreground objects.\n By analyzing the output embeddings, they found a small number of tokens (2%) had super high vector norms, causing the spikes.\n The high-norm \"outlier\" tokens occurred in redundant areas and held less local info but more global info about the image.\n Their hypothesis is that ViTs learn to identify unimportant patches and recycle them as temporary storage instead of discarding. This enables efficient processing but causes issues.\n Their fix is simple - just add dedicated \"register\" tokens that provide storage space, avoiding the recycling side effects.\n Models trained with registers have:\n  \nSmoother and more meaningful attention maps\n Small boosts in downstream performance\n Way better object discovery abilities\n  \nThe registers give ViTs a place to do their temporary computations without messing stuff up. Just a tiny architecture tweak improves interpretability and performance. Sweet!\n I think it's cool how they reverse-engineered this model artifact and fixed it with such a small change. More work like this will keep incrementally improving ViTs.\n TLDR: Vision transformers recycle useless patches to store data, causing problems.

          "description": "I was cooking chicken wings one evening ago in the not too distant past and this idea popped into my head. Before the night was over I went online and bought the domain name of GoGoAIGo . com and then the .ai version also. I put the dot com version up on Sedo (sedo.com/search/details/?domain=GoGoAIGo.com) for sale and I actually now own the .com .ai .org and .net versions of that phrase. Not only my decade but the two generational decades in front of me and the one generational decade behind me can remember our ole Inspector Gadget friend whom had a similar phrase, but not exact, that he would say.\n I'm an individual whom may hold onto something if I feel it has intrinsic value for a future development, which I think this can if laid out in an appropriate fashion. I'm working on another business project right now and I own some trademarks for my other business project so I'm not exactly a newbie in ways here I'm just kind of fresh to the AI realm studies. I think it's overblown right now but will be fine tuned over the next 5-7 years better and society will find a better seat for it.\n I could see this domain being like a search engine or something, maybe even something to do with robots. I expect AI robots moving forward will be regulated and have various classes that they are placed into as we integrate certain ones in our society. Let's be honest, the light-switch isn't flipping overnight or even in one quick year over this AI stuff. I'm in no rush to have a piece of AI wash my dishes for me to be honest. The last robotic thing I was thinking about getting was a robot mower to cut a field, I believe they are working on those now.\n Anybody have any unique ideas for me? I used to play with lego robots way back in high school in the early 2000's.... Seems like this website would make a great search engine but honestly there are other phrases that can be put into play with society also.\n Thanks for any mental stimulation you can toss in my direction.\n    submitted by    /u/Wise_Cut_2543  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Imagine an app that's like a helpful buddy in your pocket, always looking out for the best moments to nudge you into some real-world socializing. For example, say you're a fan of watching sports. The app notices you frequently check scores or read articles on sports sites during weekends. Right before a big game, it pops up and says, \"How about inviting some friends over to watch the game?\"\n Now let's talk about making socializing a sort of game. Think of the way Fitbit rewards you for walking 10,000 steps. Similarly, this app could reward you with \"social points\" for various activities. Invite a friend for coffee? 10 points. Call your mom? 15 points. Organize a barbecue? 50 points. And so on. These points could unlock virtual badges or even real-world rewards like discounts at local restaurants to encourage you to keep going.\n When it comes to setting personal goals, let's say you've been wanting to improve your relationship with a sibling. You set a goal in the app to have at least one meaningful conversation with them each week. The app then reminds you on a lazy Sunday afternoon, suggesting, \"Why not call your sister now? It’s a good time to catch up.\"\n And for reflection, after you've hung out with your friends to watch the game or had that talk with your sister, the app asks you to rate how good you felt on a scale of 1-10. Over time, you'll see a graph of your happiness levels correlated with your social activities, making it super clear that quality time with people is a mood booster.\n The whole idea is to keep it simple but effective, helping you to naturally weave more social interactions into your life without making you feel overwhelmed or stressed.\n    submitted by    /u/Georgeo57  \n [link]   [comments]",

This retains alignment with text descriptions.\n Latent diffusion then serves as a super-resolution expert, upsampling efficiently while preserving fidelity.\n  \nBy blending complementary techniques, Show-1 moves past tradeoffs limiting the individual models.\n More details here.

          "description": "Automatic code generation has always been an integral part of programming: compilers, synthesis tools, convertors, etc. are examples of classic code generators. Now, with such powerful LLMs at hand, it is only natural to try to find new ways to generate codes. The question is: are LLMs the right tool for code generation?\n There are two sides to code generation: (1) understanding the intent (a.k.a. capturing the spec) (2) writing the code. LLMs are great for (1), but not so good for (2).\n This is an example of using LLM for general-domain code generation:\n https://github.com/RoboCoachTechnologies/GPT-Synthesizer \n You can see that the main focus here is to properly capture the spec, and that's where LLMs shine.\n LLMs solution for a general-domain code generation may not be complete or optimized. It is always easier to break the problem and solve code generation in a specific domain. Here you can see how much better and cleaner the output of code generation can be when it is limited to a specific domain (robotics domain, ROS in particular, in this case):\n https://github.com/RoboCoachTechnologies/ROScribe\n What are your thoughts on using LLMs for code generation?\n    submitted by    /u/RoboCoachTech  \n [link]   [comments]",

And the video generator Layout2Vid adds better spatial and temporal control through some clever tweaks. The separation of these tasks seems to matter.\n You can read my full summary here.

It will require many characters, ranging in gender, age, ethnicity, etc. I am a decent voice actor and can do many of the roles myself, but some of them I cannot fake using my voice alone.\n My budget is very limited, so I was hoping to find some type of software I can change my voice for the production. This can be during the recording process, or after recording… As long as it gets the job done, and makes me sound like someone else entirely. \n Does anybody know of a software that can achieve this? Most of the software I found either specifically designed to change users voice on the spot and is aimed at gamers changing your voice for live streams or in-game chats. I’m also on a Mac, which I know will be limiting.\n I’m having a hard time finding something I can use. Any suggestions will be helpful. \n Thank you!\n EDIT: To clarify, I don’t want to just change my voice to sound different in general. I want to specifically sound like a woman, an elder man, or someone of a different ethnic background. Those are just a few examples.\n    submitted by    /u/nopetoocreepy  \n [link]   [comments]",

However, let's entertain the hypothetical situation where the insurrection following the 2020 U.S. presidential election had succeeded, with the understanding that this is speculative reasoning.\n In this alternate reality, the immediate consequences would be a constitutional crisis of unprecedented proportions. Faith in democratic institutions would be severely eroded, both domestically and internationally. Trump's retaining power in this manner would spark widespread protests, perhaps more intense and larger than those seen in the summer of 2020.

          "description": "Researchers from Microsoft have just proposed using a psychological assessment tool called the Defining Issues Test (DIT) to evaluate the moral reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) like GPT-3, ChatGPT, etc.\n The DIT presents moral dilemmas and has subjects rate and rank the importance of various ethical considerations related to the dilemma. It allows quantifying the sophistication of moral thinking through a P-score.\n In this new paper, the researchers tested prominent LLMs with adapted DIT prompts containing AI-relevant moral scenarios.\n Key findings:\n  \nLarge models like GPT-3 failed to comprehend prompts and scored near random baseline in moral reasoning.\n ChatGPT, Text-davinci-003 and GPT-4 showed coherent moral reasoning with above-random P-scores.\n Surprisingly, the smaller 70B LlamaChat model outscored larger models in its P-score, demonstrating advanced ethics understanding is possible without massive parameters.\n The models operated mostly at intermediate conventional levels as per Kohlberg's moral development theory. No model exhibited highly mature moral reasoning.\n  \nI think this is an interesting framework to evaluate and improve LLMs' moral intelligence before deploying them into sensitive real-world environments - to the extent that a model can be said to possess moral intelligence (or, seem to possess it?).\n Here's a link to my full summary with a lot more background on Kohlberg's model (had to read up on it since I didn't study psych).

          "description": "Training giant AI models like GPT-3 requires large resources - thousands of GPUs running for months. As a solo researcher without access to that kind of scale, I can't easily reproduce experiments and findings from papers on huge models.\n But a new paper from DeepMind shows you can recreate and study training instabilities seen in massive models by using small ones.\n The key is increasing the learning rate:\n  \nThis reproduces \"attention collapse\" where the model focuses on just a few tokens, like overfitting.\n Also can reproduce \"logit divergence\" where output values drift unstably.\n  \nThese issues have been reported when scaling up to billions of params. The cool part is techniques that fix them for giant models also work for small models:\n  \nqk-layernorm prevents attention collapse.\n Adding a \"z-loss\" term stops logit divergence.\n  \nSome other highlights from the paper include:\n  \nLonger warmup helps stability, especially for bigger models.\n Decoupling LR and weight decay improves stability.\n Depth increases sensitivity much faster than width.\n Can predict upcoming issues from scaling trends.\n Default epsilon hurts at large scale.\n  \nIf the authors are right, one more tool that lets researchers study and even help train giant models without Google-size resources. Small models can guide large model development, sort of like how you can build a scale train set to study and improve how a railroad system works... for a lot less money than starting your own railroad company, buying land, building real tracks, etc.\n Full summary.

I'm thinking of publishing a book, and I want to create clean reproductions of the stamp designs without the cancelation marks.\n If I train AI on high resolution scans of 10 to 40 identical stamps, is there a tool that can look for commonalities within the patterns and then remove conflicting artifacts (cancelation stamps, tears, and smudges)? I'm aiming for a 400% enlargement that shows off clean and accurate detail. \n What tools would I need? I’d prefer not to upload these scans to the web. Are there downloadable tools available? I’m technologically savvy and very experienced in graphic design software but have no experience in coding.\n All of this can be done manually in Photoshop, of course. But with thousands of stamp designs, I’d like to automate as much as I can.\n Thanks in advance for any insights!\n    submitted by    /u/fisheternal  \n [link]   [comments]",

Most of the alignment focus out there is on superintelligence, little out there focuses on building modern day Ai that benefits humans. That’s been my focus for 17 years when I dreamed up what was possible and sent a proposal to executives at the mfaang corporation I was working at. I found out back then business doesn’t give a rats ass about Ai that actively makes its users life’s better. Well now I have proof that customers care. I’m hoping to find some resources on Ai alignment groups, conferences, more books etc. I’ll need to hire skilled ml engineers who do give a rats ass. Compassionate Ai isn’t just feel good tech. It would be good to do some networking. AI alignment doesn’t have to wait for AGI and super intelligence. It can and should be a focus today. My startup is proving it.

Teaching them to use visual tools could make them much more capable.\n A new paper introduces GPT4Tools - a method to efficiently teach existing LLMs to invoke tools for visual tasks without proprietary data.\n My highlights from the paper:\n  \nUses ChatGPT as a \"teacher\" to generate instructional data for other LLMs\n Fine-tunes LLMs like Vicuna on this data using selective weight tuning (keeps base model frozen)\n Allows smaller 13B LLM to match 175B GPT-3.5 on seen tools after tuning\n Data augmentation with negative/context samples was found to be the secret sauce to get this to work\n Can generalize to brand new visual tools in a zero-shot way\n  \nThis is big because it shows we may not need hyper-expensive training of massive models to impart visual capabilities to LLMs. They seem to be generalizable enough that they can be taught to work with images. Some examples shown include counting objects or segmenting items in pictures using other tools.\n With this approach, existing models can be made multi-modal! Pretty cool.\n Full summary.

(A minimum of 15 minutes is recommended)\n When I take a prerecorded voice clip and feed it through the voice profile I created, it’s just silent for all 15 seconds that it grants you before you upgrade.\n Then it has the little 2 second audio watermark at the end, where it says “voice AI,” and that I can hear perfectly fine!\n I’ve searched all over for others who might have had this problem, but it seems like the main problem people have reported difficulties with audio are/were tend to center around the live mode failing to function properly.\n Has anyone had this issue before?\n Should I add more audio to the voice profile to make it more well rounded perhaps?\n If so, how much audio do you typically need to create a solid custom voice profile?\n Should I just update to the paid version? I don’t really think that would fix it, and I wanted to wait to upgrade until I had some proof that it worked, yanno?\n I’m not sure what to do…\n Any ideas?\n    submitted by    /u/WhenTheFoxGRINS  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "As AI models get bigger, training them requires more and more computing power. Researchers are looking for ways to train these large AI models without needing Google-scale resources.\n A new paper proposes LongLoRA, a fine-tuning approach that can extend LLaMA2 7B to 100k context length and 70B model to 32k context length on a single 8× A100 machine.\n Here are my highlights from the paper:\n Big one of course: LongLoRA efficiently fine-tunes large AI models on longer texts\n Key points:\n  \nApproximates standard attention via \"shift short attention\" during training\n Tuning only a subset of weights (LoRA) plus some embeddings & norms\n Fine-tuned 7B parameter model on 100k tokens with 1 machine\n Way lower training cost than full fine-tuning for large contexts\n Close to full fine-tuning performance\n  \nThe core insight is that an approximation of full attention enables efficient training while retaining standard attention for final inference. Combined with selective weight tuning, this really reduces compute needs.\n I think this demonstrates the potential to train more capable AI without unreasonable resources. Efficient training techniques = more powerful LLMs for the same resources.\n Full summary here.\n    submitted by    /u/Successful-Western27  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Edit: FLAC is the tested audio extension, not MP3\n I read the new paper from DeepMind so you don't have to. Here are the key highlights:\n  \nDespite training on text, langauge models compressed images 43% better than PNG, and audio nearly 2x better than flac.\n Confirmation of scaling laws - bigger models compressed better. But model size must match dataset size.\n There are tradeoffs between model scale, data size, and compression performance. More data enables bigger models.\n Tokenization (like BPE) generally hurts compression slightly by making prediction harder.\n Longer contexts let models exploit more sequential dependencies.\n  \nImplications:\n  \nModels have learned very general capabilities beyond just text. Their strong compression reflects deep understanding of images, audio etc statistically.\n I got some new perspective on model scaling laws and links between prediction and generalization.\n There's potential for practical applications compressing images, video etc. But large model size an issue.\n Overall it shows these models are very capable general purpose learners, not just for language.\n  \nFull summary here if you want more details.

For that I am sampling 200.000 uniformly distributed points from a wide interval, e.g. [-60,60] and compute the corresponding sin(x) values resulting in the following training data. \n ​\n Training data\n I glimpse into my setup: \n Model:\n nn.Linear(1, 16) nn.Sigmoid() Linear(16, 16) nn.Sigmoid() nn.Linear(16, 8) nn.Sigmoid() nn.Linear(8, 4) nn.Sigmoid() nn.Linear(4, 1) (I also pumped up the network to up to 100 hidden neurons on one layer) \n Number of samples: 200.000 (80% train / 20% test)\n Optimizer: Adam\n Loss: RMSE\n Epochs between 100 - 500\n Learning Rate: 0.02\n Batch Size: 500 - 1000\n ​\n Check out the screenshots below to see the results 😨\n ​\n The predictions are pretty good but the edge areas slow down to a very small value, without any change. This only holds for high-frequency sine waves. If we only consider the train range of [-2*np.pi , 2*np.pi] it works pretty good with small loss.\n ​\n So my questions are: \n 1) Why do we see that behaviour? \n 2) How can we solve it\n ​\n Cheers\n ​\n Prediction 1\n ​\n Prediction 2\n    submitted by    /u/CarKla  \n [link]   [comments]",

The model is designed to output the probability that a specific input should be classified with label 1.\n Currently, I am experimenting with hyperparameter tuning, adjusting the learning rate, epoch, and batch size. However, I've observed an issue where, with certain combinations of hyperparameters, the maximum probability outputted by the model is not 1, but rather 0.25, for example. How is this possible?\n Thanks\n    submitted by    /u/nllnp  \n [link]   [comments]",

Are there guys here who possess a strong grasp of AI neural network logic?\n ​\n I've extracted a character from an anime scene using a mask, and saved it as a PNG sequence which contains solely the anime character along with an alpha (transparent) background.\n ​\n I'm curious about how the Flowframes neural network can recreate the background that was originally behind the character but removed by the mask. It's impossible since the PNG images don't have that background info. \n ​\n Can anyone explain how this works?\n ​\n Attachments: \n - Image #1: \n https://preview.redd.it/z2bypfkstvqb1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=c534167c5ae4129c04f9b8b2fbca3bac350a1d4a\n - Image #2: \n https://preview.redd.it/x5kkzs2ttvqb1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=6838d7ca5e1e4f19ba46c04750fdaea537a787f0\n (Don't mind the black background in the thumbnails, it's a bug, there's actually a transparent background)\n ​\n * Flowframes is a app that utilizes advanced AI frameworks to interpolate videos in order to increase their framerate in the most natural looking way possible.\n    submitted by    /u/drkysqrl  \n [link]   [comments]",

Grateful for any answers or suggestions for where he could find them!\n His note:\n I have many questions, but they all revolve around two issues.\n The first is when the weights in the neural net converge, do they exhibit any recognizable pattern. I realize that when the number of nodes and levels in the net are large it may be impossible to recognize the pattern. But suppose that the problem being examined is a simple categorization and the number of nodes in the net is small, is it possible to see a pattern in the weights? The network is supposed to …",

The remarkable in-context learning (ICL) ability of LLMs also leads to efficient few-shot learners that can generalize from few-shot input-label pairs. However, the predictions of LLMs are highly sensitive and even biased to the choice of templates, label spaces (such as yes/no, true/false, correct/incorrect), and demonstration examples, resulting in unexpected performance degradation and barriers for pursuing robust LLM applications.

Would it be possible to achieve similar effects solely from a video captured using a mobile phone’s camera, without a Hollywood budget?\n\n\n\nIn “DynIBaR: Neural Dynamic Image-Based Rendering”, a best paper honorable mention at CVPR 2023, we describe a new method that generates photorealistic free-viewp…",

The most commonly-used paradigm for learning DNNs is empirical risk minimization (ERM), which aims to identify a network that minimizes the average loss on training data points. Several algorithms, including stochastic gradient descent (SGD), Adam, and Adagrad, have been proposed for solving ERM. However, a drawback of ERM is that it weights all the samples equally, often ignoring the rare and more difficult samples, and focusing on the easier and abundant samples. This leads to suboptimal performance on unseen data, espe…",

It implements several different classes of users: for example one for which the heart rate increases when the vibration frequency stays the same, another that prefers when it increases over time, etc.\n We determined that we need to have as a state the current heart rate but also a table of the k previous heart rates and the actions associated. Without that memory, we would not be able to tell apart the different profiles as in the same state, we would need to do different actions to satisfy them both. We then have a correlation between previous samples and the action we make at current state, which I have read makes the problem non markovian.\n Is there a way to solve this problem using a DQN algorithm, given that we need to memorize the previous samples linearly which seems to go against the algorithm behavior and the usage of a replay memory? Are there more suited algorithms?\n    submitted by    /u/Outrageous-Subject38  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I am reading this paper and came across the following paragraph - \n ​\n \"Model usage. Many recent model-based algorithms have focused on the setting in which model\n rollouts begin from the initial state distribution (Kurutach et al., 2018; Clavera et al., 2018). While\n this may be a more faithful interpretation of Algorithm 1, as it is optimizing a policy purely under\n the state distribution of the model, this approach entangles the model rollout length with the task\n horizon. Because compounding model errors make extended rollouts difficult, these works evaluate\n on truncated versions of benchmarks. The branching strategy described in Section 4.2, in which\n model rollouts begin from the state distribution of a different policy under the true environment\n dynamics, effectively relieves this limitation. In practice, branching replaces few long rollouts from\n the initial state distribution with many short rollouts starting from replay buffer states.\"\n ​\n  \nWhat does state distribtion mean over here?\n Also in line 8 of the image, I don't understand what's the relation between model rollout and policy \\pi_t. Is it saying, use the model free algorithm to take future steps from that state?

          "description": "Deep reinforcement learning has led to a variety of compelling results. However, performance issues, particularly relating to the data efficiency of simulation has limited it applicability in domains where simulations run more slowly. Our solution is to use a logic base framework, PyReason, as a proxy for the simulation.\n ​\n https://preview.redd.it/6wmg0qnlaaub1.png?width=1786&format=png&auto=webp&s=01f82cf24de79b317b6f9406b0b6379b949a34d3\n We showed that inference with PyReason logic program can provide up to a three order-of-magnitude speedup when compared with native simulations (we studied AFSIM and Starcraft2) while providing comparable reward and win rate (we found that PyReason-trained agents actually performed better than expected in both AFSIM and Starcraft2).\n ​\n https://preview.redd.it/u8f44fskaaub1.png?width=1636&format=png&auto=webp&s=9509f03a936f41cd0131388564833b86a39c295a\n However, the benefits of our semantic proxy go well beyond performance. The use of temporal logic programming has two crucial beneficial by-products such as symbolic explainability and modularity. PyReason provides an explainable symbolic trace that captures the evolution of the environment in a precise manner while modularity allows us to add or remove aspects of the logic program – allowing for adjustments to the simulation based on a library of behaviors. PyReason is well-suited to model simulated environments for other reasons – namely the ability to directly capture non-Markovian relationships and the open-world nature (defaults are “uncertain” instead of true or false). We have demonstrated that agents can be trained using standard RL techniques such as DQN using this framework.\n Preprint: https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.06835\n Video: https://youtu.be/9e6ZHJEJzgw\n Code for PyReason-as-a-Sim (integration with DQN): https://github.com/lab-v2/pyreason-rl-sim\n Code for PyReason Gym: https://github.com/lab-v2/pyreason-gym\n PyReason Home: neurosymbolic.asu.edu/pyreason/\n ​\n    submitted by    /u/Neurosymbolic  \n [link]   [comments]",

This is then fed to the model by a pytorch DataLoader. This means a _lot_ of disk reads during the optimization step which can't be ideal but I'll put that aside. \n What is the advantage of doing this selection by episode?

          "description": "Hi everyone!\n We used our opensource library SheepRL 🐑 and our PyTorch implementation of DreamerV3 on Crafter, an open-world survival game, featuring randomly generated 2D worlds, in which players have the freedom to explore a large and expansive map and need to forage for food, collect materials, build tools and find shelter. Here is a short video 👉 https://youtu.be/7XEBT2msUUQ\n In open-world games, ensuring they are playable and bug-free is crucial, but is becoming increasingly difficult and time-consuming using manual game testing. Maximizing exploration using Reinforcement Learning is extremely useful for testing games at scale, because of the wide variety of gameplay scenes the player may encounter.\n Why is the test on Crafter so interesting for game testing?\n Because Crafter evaluates a large number of general capabilities related to the RL agent, like strong ability to generalise (new generated maps for each episode), to deal with partial observability (each input image reveals only a small part of the world) and to long-term reasoning and survival.\n These abilities are very useful for testing games at scale, providing developers with insights to optimise gameplay and player experience.\n The future of game testing is here, and it is powered by Artificial Intelligence! 🔥\n ---\n ❌ Are you interested in joining the project community? Get in touch 👉 https://github.com/Eclectic-Sheep/sheeprl ❌\n SheepRL 🐑 is open-source, fully written in PyTorch and accelerated with LightningFabric - by Lightning AI.

I give the episode reward for every action EXCEPT the \"end early\" action, now I will need to give some boost for shorter episodes to achieve the desired effect :) \n I feel like I'm experiencing déjà vu, posing another DQN-related question. But, here's my issue:\n I've set up an environment where an agent can interact for 40 steps or choose to end the interaction early with a specific action. The catch is that the reward is only given at the end of the episode, which seems to be leading the agent to strongly favor the \"end early\" action. Despite all other steps getting a reward of 0, I assumed the long-term reward estimate, V(s_{t+1}), would mitigate this, but the agent still heavily gravitates towards ending the episode early.\n Attempted Solutions:\n  \nDistributed the end-of-episode reward across all prior actions taken by the agent.\n  \nConsidering:\n  \nReplacing the \"end early\" action with a \"do nothing\" action, allowing the episode to always play out in full.

          "description": "I learned about DeepNash and R-NaD yesterday. I read the Deepmind article, Science paper, and the source code of rnad.py. But I don't think I understand it! Part of this is that they didn't define all the terms and Greek they use in the paper, and part of it is that I don't have academic ML experience.\n Below is my attempt to summarize the paper in non-academic terms. I'm trying to show that I did my homework, and also I'm trying to invoke Godwin's Law in the hopes that someone will come along and correct me.\n Here goes:\n Naïve reinforcement learning doesn't work with simultaneous choice games such as matching pennies or Rock-Paper-Scissors.\n In naïve RL, If I choose Rock as my move, my opponent chooses Scissors as their move, and I see that I won, that will reinforce a belief that Rock is a \"good\" move and Scissors is a \"bad\" move. But this isn't true!\n This means that, during selfplay, a naïve RL agent will just cycle through strategies, as the timestep-(τ_n) agent learns how to beat the timestep-(τ_n-1) agent. The agent will never learn that RPS is a game about staying unpredictable!\n R-NaD fixes this by adjusting the reward function. I think \"regularizing\" is ML-academic speak for \"adjusting\". It adjusts the reward function in such a way that the agent will converge at a Nash equilibrium strategy.\n The paper's equation (1) describes how the regularization works. They didn't explain all the terms, though. I still don't know what a_i represents. But I think it corresponds to parts of the code like this line and this line.\n The key is that we're merging policies from multiple epochs and making sure that the current agent's move probabilities fare well against not only itself, but also against its previous two generations. They've proven that three generations is all you need to eventually converge to a Nash equilibrium.\n So... that's my understanding. Does anyone with actual ML experience want to weigh in?\n    submitted by    /u/lord_braleigh  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "For a potential school project, im currently exploring whether or not some of the success the transformer architecture has had in seq-to-seq applications and high-dimensional pattern recognition could be extended to certain (online) RL problems (mainly those with high dimensional environment as well as long-term planning). \n This could be done by using an augmented transformer as a function approximator, probably in combination with a SOTA online-rl algorithm (such as PPO, but if you know something that generally performs better do tell). Due to some of the problems associated with highly complex models and sample efficiency, I also thought about training the model using imitation learning first (which should be no problem with policy gradient methods afaik, though some slight adjustments would have to be made). For context, I'm thinking on benchmarking the approach using AlphaStar unplugged.\n However, when looking at current literature, only very few papers directly use transformers this way. Transformers seem to be very sample efficient and to generalize very well, but they are still only really used in a purely offline context (sometimes without directly using RL-techniques, such as with the Decision Transformer). And, if they are used in an online context, then only in some really intricate combination with other models (such as in AlphaStar). \n Is there a reason why the approach I am currently considering is not popular in literature?

But I find it very difficult to tune.\n I mean I tuned and programmed successfully various algorithm such as different GAN that are not necessarily very easy to tune. RL algorithm seems even worse.\n I tried several grid world problems, cart pole and even a very simple second order system regulation (integrator + 1 st order pôle). \n Even the Matlab cart pole demo with ddqn does not provide a very satisfactory result (after training, the contrôler keep the pendulum in uprigth position, but the cart slowly drift).\n On the second order system, the learning seems ok for about 200 épisode(test shows that the expected behavior is almost learnt) and then suddenly the average episode score has a kind of inflection and everything blowns up, despite a very large replay buffer.\n So my question : is it possible to make dqn and ddqn work well with a reasonable tuning session length? Are policy optimization easier to tune (and/or more efficient)? So far, it seems to me that these action-vzlue based algorithms are highly unstable and the training may only works for a 'miraculous' tunning.

I have aquired so much knowledge in the data science field and truth be told I love it, it engages my mind like crazy so I've decided that i would like my career to be revolved around electronics and programming/ data science.\n Back to the topic, I am working on object detection (I got it figured out), and reinforcement learning, so what I would like to do is to train the model on reaching it's destination using collision avoidance, I have a PIX4, RPI 4B 4GBs since I'm also building my drone from scratch, so let's say I have all the hardware which ofcourse includes the GPS + Compass and 5 ultrasonic sensors, 1 at each side and 1 down to hold the altitude accurately. I was thinking of HITL, making a virtual environment to train my model there because this is what logic says, ofcourse( I could also fly it using the RC controller and for example test if the obstacle avoidance is going to overrule the manual drive, which is also my objective). The question is: how can I make sure virtual drone is going to be equipped with the real-life sensors and in the needed positions? How can I feed all the sensors data during the training? Which type of reinforcement learning models should I implement? \n I just feel like I dragged myself into an incredibly amazing and complex project which is going to end up fucking my semester and I won't be able to graduate, it's just that my stress now is skyrocketing. \n Please feel free to throw any advice or opinions my way, and thank you for keeping up with this long post. 😁\n    submitted by    /u/Gabii99  \n [link]   [comments]",

From what I understand, the update is proportional to the Critic's TD error. A better than expected reward will lead the actor to increase the prob of taking the associated action, and a disappointing reward will make the actor to move away from the given action.\n Here's where I feel like I'm missing a piece of the puzzle. Between a good state/action pair accurately valued by the Critic and a bad state/action pair undervalued by the Critic, the actor's update will favor the bad action more. Could we not conceive a scenario in which the agent gets stuck in a suboptimal policy because of that particular behavior?\n What triggers this questioning is that I have implemented a standard AC algo for Pixelcopter and found my agent getting stuck easily on a suboptimal policy (i.e. constantly getting higher, or lower until crash, while the critics assign good values on center squares and bad values to squares close to the wall's edge). For TD0, this is pretty marginal, but gets more significant for n-step TD as n increases.\n Any thoughts?\n    submitted by    /u/infundibuliforme  \n [link]   [comments]",

I have a dataset with 2 features (X and Y). \n I am trying to tune a second order Transfer Function to fit X to Y( has 3 parameters) and gives Y’ as output.\n So I currently consider the error between Y and Y’ as the “State” and try to minimise the error by modelling a reward function that checks for instability and unreasonable values. I am trying to do this using TD3 but the model does not learn. I am wondering if there are any approaches that I should consider.\n I chose TD3 since my action space is continuous. \n I am sorry if I don’t understand something basic since I’m a noob to this. Thanks for your help in advance. :) \n Some more details: the dataset values don’t change. I give the same values for every time step.

          "description": "I am reading the following article on SpinningUp but can't get my head around policy collapse - \n \"This is different from normal policy gradient, which keeps new and old policies close in parameter space. But even seemingly small differences in parameter space can have very large differences in performance—so a single bad step can collapse the policy performance. This makes it dangerous to use large step sizes with vanilla policy gradients, thus hurting its sample efficiency. TRPO nicely avoids this kind of collapse, and tends to quickly and monotonically improve performance.\" \n Why would updating the parameters lead to a policy collapse? The parameters are updated based on the performance of the RL system and therefore, I don't see the point of constraints.\n    submitted by    /u/Academic-Rent7800  \n [link]   [comments]",
