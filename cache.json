Our results reveal that the classification from the KNN model is more accurately representative of the state of the current crop field in 2017 than the ground truth classification data from 2015. These results are a testament to the power of Planet’s high-cadence geospatial imagery. Agricultural fields change often, sometimes multiple times a season, and having high-frequency satellite imagery available to observe and analyze this land can provide immense value to our understanding of agricultural land and quickly-changing environments.",

This enables users to chat with the image to confirm if it contains any inappropriate content that violates the organization’s policies. We use the powerful generating capability of LLMs to generate the final decision including safe/unsafe labels and category type. In addition, by designing a prompt, we can make an LLM generate the defined output format, such as JSON format. The designed prompt template allows the LLM to determine if the image violates the moderation policy, identify the category of violation, explain why, and provide the output in a structured JSON format.",

Different from multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) where\nmultiple agents are in a common environment and should learn to cooperate or\ncompete with each other, in this case each agent has its separate environment\nand only communicates with others to share knowledge without any cooperative or\ncompetitive behaviour as a learning outcome. In fact, this scenario exists\nwidely in real life whose concept can be utilised in many applications, but is\nnot well understood yet and not well formulated. As the first effort, we\npropose group-agent system for RL as a formulation of this scenario and the\nthird type of RL system with respect to single-agent and multi-agent systems.\nWe then propose a distributed RL framework called DDAL (Decentralised\nDistributed Asynchronous Learning) designed for group-agent reinforcement\nlearning (GARL).

          "description": "Classifiers built upon vision-language models such as CLIP have shown\nremarkable zero-shot performance across a broad range of image classification\ntasks. Prior work has studied different ways of automatically creating\ndescriptor sets for every class based on prompt templates, ranging from\nmanually engineered templates over templates obtained from a large language\nmodel to templates built from random words and characters. In contrast,\nderiving zero-shot classifiers from the respective encoded class descriptors\nhas remained nearly unchanged, that is: classify to the class that maximizes\nthe cosine similarity between its averaged encoded class descriptors and the\nencoded image. However, weighting all class descriptors equally can be\nsuboptimal when certain descriptors match visual clues on a given image better\nthan others. In this work, we propose AutoCLIP, a method for auto-tuning\nzero-shot classifiers. AutoCLIP assigns to each prompt template per-image\nweights, which are derived from statistics of class descriptor-image\nsimilarities at inference time. AutoCLIP is fully unsupervised, has very low\noverhead, and can be easily implemented in few lines of code. We show that for\na broad range of vision-language models, datasets, and prompt templates,\nAutoCLIP outperforms baselines consistently and by up to 3 percent point\naccuracy.",

Machine learning models,\nincluding the now ubiquitous transformers, struggle to generalize in this way,\nand typically require thousands of examples of a concept during training in\norder to generalize meaningfully. This difference in ability between humans and\nartificial neural architectures, motivates this study on a neuro-symbolic\narchitecture called the Compositional Program Generator (CPG). CPG has three\nkey features: modularity, type abstraction, and recursive composition, that\nenable it to generalize both systematically to new concepts in a few-shot\nmanner, as well as productively by length on various sequence-to-sequence\nlanguage tasks. For each input, CPG uses a grammar of the input domain and a\nparser to generate a type hierarchy in which each grammar rule is assigned its\nown unique semantic module, a probabilistic copy or substitution program.\nInstances with the same hierarchy are processed with the same composed program,\nwhile those with different hierarchies may be processed with different\nprograms. CPG learns parameters for the semantic modules and is able to learn\nthe semantics for new types incrementally. Given a context-free grammar of the\ninput language and a dictionary mapping each word in the source language to its\ninterpretation in the output language, CPG can achieve perfect generalization\non the SCAN and COGS benchmarks, in both standard and extreme few-shot\nsettings.",

          "description": "Semi-supervised learning (SSL) is a promising approach for training deep\nclassification models using labeled and unlabeled datasets. However, existing\nSSL methods rely on a large unlabeled dataset, which may not always be\navailable in many real-world applications due to legal constraints (e.g.,\nGDPR). In this paper, we investigate the research question: Can we train SSL\nmodels without real unlabeled datasets? Instead of using real unlabeled\ndatasets, we propose an SSL method using synthetic datasets generated from\ngenerative foundation models trained on datasets containing millions of samples\nin diverse domains (e.g., ImageNet). Our main concepts are identifying\nsynthetic samples that emulate unlabeled samples from generative foundation\nmodels and training classifiers using these synthetic samples. To achieve this,\nour method is formulated as an alternating optimization problem: (i)\nmeta-learning of generative foundation models and (ii) SSL of classifiers using\nreal labeled and synthetic unlabeled samples. For (i), we propose a\nmeta-learning objective that optimizes latent variables to generate samples\nthat resemble real labeled samples and minimize the validation loss. For (ii),\nwe propose a simple unsupervised loss function that regularizes the feature\nextractors of classifiers to maximize the performance improvement obtained from\nsynthetic samples. We confirm that our method outperforms baselines using\ngenerative foundation models on SSL. We also demonstrate that our methods\noutperform SSL using real unlabeled datasets in scenarios with extremely small\namounts of labeled datasets. This suggests that synthetic samples have the\npotential to provide improvement gains more efficiently than real unlabeled\ndata.",

We observe that the vanilla\nphysics-informed DeepONets with modified MLP may exhibit instability in\nmaintaining the desired limiting macroscopic behavior. Therefore, this\nnecessitates the utilization of an asymptotic-preserving loss function. Drawing\ninspiration from the heat kernel in the diffusion equation, we propose a new\narchitecture called Convolutional Deep Operator Networks, which employ multiple\nlocal convolution operations instead of a global heat kernel, along with\npooling and activation operations in each filter layer. Our APCON methods\npossess a parameter count that is independent of the grid size and are capable\nof capturing the diffusive behavior of the linear transport problem. Finally,\nwe validate the effectiveness of our methods through several numerical\nexamples.",

          "description": "Automated diagnosis of eczema from digital camera images is crucial for\ndeveloping applications that allow patients to self-monitor their recovery. An\nimportant component of this is the segmentation of eczema region from such\nimages. Current methods for eczema segmentation rely on deep neural networks\nsuch as convolutional (CNN)-based U-Net or transformer-based Swin U-Net. While\neffective, these methods require high volume of annotated data, which can be\ndifficult to obtain. Here, we investigate the capabilities of visual in-context\nlearning that can perform few-shot eczema segmentation with just a handful of\nexamples and without any need for retraining models. Specifically, we propose a\nstrategy for applying in-context learning for eczema segmentation with a\ngeneralist vision model called SegGPT. When benchmarked on a dataset of\nannotated eczema images, we show that SegGPT with just 2 representative example\nimages from the training dataset performs better (mIoU: 36.69) than a CNN U-Net\ntrained on 428 images (mIoU: 32.60). We also discover that using more number of\nexamples for SegGPT may in fact be harmful to its performance. Our result\nhighlights the importance of visual in-context learning in developing faster\nand better solutions to skin imaging tasks. Our result also paves the way for\ndeveloping inclusive solutions that can cater to minorities in the demographics\nwho are typically heavily under-represented in the training data.",

Although this helps strengthen the multimodal information\nrepresentation, designing such networks is labor-intensive.

          "description": "Federated learning has gained popularity as a means of training models\ndistributed across the wireless edge. The paper introduces delay-aware\nhierarchical federated learning (DFL) to improve the efficiency of distributed\nmachine learning (ML) model training by accounting for communication delays\nbetween edge and cloud. Different from traditional federated learning, DFL\nleverages multiple stochastic gradient descent iterations on local datasets\nwithin each global aggregation period and intermittently aggregates model\nparameters through edge servers in local subnetworks. During global\nsynchronization, the cloud server consolidates local models with the outdated\nglobal model using a local-global combiner, thus preserving crucial elements of\nboth, enhancing learning efficiency under the presence of delay. A set of\nconditions is obtained to achieve the sub-linear convergence rate of O(1/k) for\nstrongly convex and smooth loss functions. Based on these findings, an adaptive\ncontrol algorithm is developed for DFL, implementing policies to mitigate\nenergy consumption and communication latency while aiming for sublinear\nconvergence. Numerical evaluations show DFL's superior performance in terms of\nfaster global model convergence, reduced resource consumption, and robustness\nagainst communication delays compared to existing FL algorithms. In summary,\nthis proposed method offers improved efficiency and results when dealing with\nboth convex and non-convex loss functions.",

In this\nwork, we make one of the first attempts at studying the impact of adversarially\nrobust models on actionable explanations which provide end users with a means\nfor recourse. We theoretically and empirically analyze the cost (ease of\nimplementation) and validity (probability of obtaining a positive model\nprediction) of recourses output by state-of-the-art algorithms when the\nunderlying models are adversarially robust vs. non-robust. More specifically,\nwe derive theoretical bounds on the differences between the cost and the\nvalidity of the recourses generated by state-of-the-art algorithms for\nadversarially robust vs. non-robust linear and non-linear models. Our empirical\nresults with multiple real-world datasets validate our theoretical results and\nshow the impact of varying degrees of model robustness on the cost and validity\nof the resulting recourses.

          "description": "While reliable data-driven decision-making hinges on high-quality labeled\ndata, the acquisition of quality labels often involves laborious human\nannotations or slow and expensive scientific measurements. Machine learning is\nbecoming an appealing alternative as sophisticated predictive techniques are\nbeing used to quickly and cheaply produce large amounts of predicted labels;\ne.g., predicted protein structures are used to supplement experimentally\nderived structures, predictions of socioeconomic indicators from satellite\nimagery are used to supplement accurate survey data, and so on. Since\npredictions are imperfect and potentially biased, this practice brings into\nquestion the validity of downstream inferences. We introduce cross-prediction:\na method for valid inference powered by machine learning. With a small labeled\ndataset and a large unlabeled dataset, cross-prediction imputes the missing\nlabels via machine learning and applies a form of debiasing to remedy the\nprediction inaccuracies. The resulting inferences achieve the desired error\nprobability and are more powerful than those that only leverage the labeled\ndata. Closely related is the recent proposal of prediction-powered inference,\nwhich assumes that a good pre-trained model is already available. We show that\ncross-prediction is consistently more powerful than an adaptation of\nprediction-powered inference in which a fraction of the labeled data is split\noff and used to train the model. Finally, we observe that cross-prediction\ngives more stable conclusions than its competitors; its confidence intervals\ntypically have significantly lower variability.",

          "description": "Model overconfidence and poor calibration are common in machine learning and\ndifficult to account for when applying standard empirical risk minimization. In\nthis work, we propose a novel method to alleviate these problems that we call\nodd-$k$-out learning (OKO), which minimizes the cross-entropy error for sets\nrather than for single examples. This naturally allows the model to capture\ncorrelations across data examples and achieves both better accuracy and\ncalibration, especially in limited training data and class-imbalanced regimes.\nPerhaps surprisingly, OKO often yields better calibration even when training\nwith hard labels and dropping any additional calibration parameter tuning, such\nas temperature scaling. We provide theoretical justification, establishing that\nOKO naturally yields better calibration, and provide extensive experimental\nanalyses that corroborate our theoretical findings. We emphasize that OKO is a\ngeneral framework that can be easily adapted to many settings and the trained\nmodel can be applied to single examples at inference time, without introducing\nsignificant run-time overhead or architecture changes.",

Better augmentation techniques benefit the\nquality of the contrastive samples, thus being one of key factors to improve\nperformance. However, the augmentation samples in existing methods are always\npredefined by human experiences, and agnostic from the downstream task\nclustering, thus leading to high human resource costs and poor performance. To\nthis end, we propose an Attribute Graph Clustering method via Learnable\nAugmentation (\\textbf{AGCLA}), which introduces learnable augmentors for\nhigh-quality and suitable augmented samples for CDGC. Specifically, we design\ntwo learnable augmentors for attribute and structure information, respectively.\nBesides, two refinement matrices, including the high-confidence pseudo-label\nmatrix and the cross-view sample similarity matrix, are generated to improve\nthe reliability of the learned affinity matrix. During the training procedure,\nwe notice that there exist differences between the optimization goals for\ntraining learnable augmentors and contrastive learning networks. In other\nwords, we should both guarantee the consistency of the embeddings as well as\nthe diversity of the augmented samples. Thus, an adversarial learning mechanism\nis designed in our method. Moreover, a two-stage training strategy is leveraged\nfor the high-confidence refinement matrices. Extensive experimental results\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of AGCLA on six benchmark datasets.",

          "description": "Graph unlearning has emerged as a pivotal method to delete information from a\npre-trained graph neural network (GNN). One may delete nodes, a class of nodes,\nedges, or a class of edges. An unlearning method enables the GNN model to\ncomply with data protection regulations (i.e., the right to be forgotten),\nadapt to evolving data distributions, and reduce the GPU-hours carbon footprint\nby avoiding repetitive retraining. Existing partitioning and aggregation-based\nmethods have limitations due to their poor handling of local graph dependencies\nand additional overhead costs. More recently, GNNDelete offered a\nmodel-agnostic approach that alleviates some of these issues. Our work takes a\nnovel approach to address these challenges in graph unlearning through\nknowledge distillation, as it distills to delete in GNN (D2DGN). It is a\nmodel-agnostic distillation framework where the complete graph knowledge is\ndivided and marked for retention and deletion. It performs distillation with\nresponse-based soft targets and feature-based node embedding while minimizing\nKL divergence. The unlearned model effectively removes the influence of deleted\ngraph elements while preserving knowledge about the retained graph elements.\nD2DGN surpasses the performance of existing methods when evaluated on various\nreal-world graph datasets by up to $43.1\\%$ (AUC) in edge and node unlearning\ntasks. Other notable advantages include better efficiency, better performance\nin removing target elements, preservation of performance for the retained\nelements, and zero overhead costs. Notably, our D2DGN surpasses the\nstate-of-the-art GNNDelete in AUC by $2.4\\%$, improves membership inference\nratio by $+1.3$, requires $10.2\\times10^6$ fewer FLOPs per forward pass and up\nto $\\mathbf{3.2}\\times$ faster.",

Instead, we leverage a single standard language modeling\nobjective, maximizing the average log probability over sequence tokens. Second,\nour approach bypasses post-hoc interaction heuristics where individual agent\ntrajectory generation is conducted prior to interactive scoring. Instead,\nMotionLM produces joint distributions over interactive agent futures in a\nsingle autoregressive decoding process. In addition, the model's sequential\nfactorization enables temporally causal conditional rollouts. The proposed\napproach establishes new state-of-the-art performance for multi-agent motion\nprediction on the Waymo Open Motion Dataset, ranking 1st on the interactive\nchallenge leaderboard.",

          "description": "The primary bottleneck towards obtaining good recognition performance in IR\nimages is the lack of sufficient labeled training data, owing to the cost of\nacquiring such data. Realizing that object detection methods for the RGB\nmodality are quite robust (at least for some commonplace classes, like person,\ncar, etc.), thanks to the giant training sets that exist, in this work we seek\nto leverage cues from the RGB modality to scale object detectors to the IR\nmodality, while preserving model performance in the RGB modality. At the core\nof our method, is a novel tensor decomposition method called TensorFact which\nsplits the convolution kernels of a layer of a Convolutional Neural Network\n(CNN) into low-rank factor matrices, with fewer parameters than the original\nCNN. We first pretrain these factor matrices on the RGB modality, for which\nplenty of training data are assumed to exist and then augment only a few\ntrainable parameters for training on the IR modality to avoid over-fitting,\nwhile encouraging them to capture complementary cues from those trained only on\nthe RGB modality. We validate our approach empirically by first assessing how\nwell our TensorFact decomposed network performs at the task of detecting\nobjects in RGB images vis-a-vis the original network and then look at how well\nit adapts to IR images of the FLIR ADAS v1 dataset. For the latter, we train\nmodels under scenarios that pose challenges stemming from data paucity. From\nthe experiments, we observe that: (i) TensorFact shows performance gains on RGB\nimages; (ii) further, this pre-trained model, when fine-tuned, outperforms a\nstandard state-of-the-art object detector on the FLIR ADAS v1 dataset by about\n4% in terms of mAP 50 score.",

          "description": "Fair machine learning seeks to mitigate model prediction bias against certain\ndemographic subgroups such as elder and female. Recently, fair representation\nlearning (FRL) trained by deep neural networks has demonstrated superior\nperformance, whereby representations containing no demographic information are\ninferred from the data and then used as the input to classification or other\ndownstream tasks. Despite the development of FRL methods, their vulnerability\nunder data poisoning attack, a popular protocol to benchmark model robustness\nunder adversarial scenarios, is under-explored. Data poisoning attacks have\nbeen developed for classical fair machine learning methods which incorporate\nfairness constraints into shallow-model classifiers. Nonetheless, these attacks\nfall short in FRL due to notably different fairness goals and model\narchitectures. This work proposes the first data poisoning framework attacking\nFRL. We induce the model to output unfair representations that contain as much\ndemographic information as possible by injecting carefully crafted poisoning\nsamples into the training data. This attack entails a prohibitive bilevel\noptimization, wherefore an effective approximated solution is proposed. A\ntheoretical analysis on the needed number of poisoning samples is derived and\nsheds light on defending against the attack. Experiments on benchmark fairness\ndatasets and state-of-the-art fair representation learning models demonstrate\nthe superiority of our attack.",

          "description": "Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong capabilities in various\naspects. However, when applying them to the highly specialized, safe-critical\nlegal domain, it is unclear how much legal knowledge they possess and whether\nthey can reliably perform legal-related tasks. To address this gap, we propose\na comprehensive evaluation benchmark LawBench. LawBench has been meticulously\ncrafted to have precise assessment of the LLMs' legal capabilities from three\ncognitive levels: (1) Legal knowledge memorization: whether LLMs can memorize\nneeded legal concepts, articles and facts; (2) Legal knowledge understanding:\nwhether LLMs can comprehend entities, events and relationships within legal\ntext; (3) Legal knowledge applying: whether LLMs can properly utilize their\nlegal knowledge and make necessary reasoning steps to solve realistic legal\ntasks. LawBench contains 20 diverse tasks covering 5 task types: single-label\nclassification (SLC), multi-label classification (MLC), regression, extraction\nand generation. We perform extensive evaluations of 51 LLMs on LawBench,\nincluding 20 multilingual LLMs, 22 Chinese-oriented LLMs and 9 legal specific\nLLMs. The results show that GPT-4 remains the best-performing LLM in the legal\ndomain, surpassing the others by a significant margin. While fine-tuning LLMs\non legal specific text brings certain improvements, we are still a long way\nfrom obtaining usable and reliable LLMs in legal tasks. All data, model\npredictions and evaluation code are released in\nhttps://github.com/open-compass/LawBench/. We hope this benchmark provides\nin-depth understanding of the LLMs' domain-specified capabilities and speed up\nthe development of LLMs in the legal domain.",

          "description": "Batch reinforcement learning (RL) defines the task of learning from a fixed\nbatch of data lacking exhaustive exploration. Worst-case optimality algorithms,\nwhich calibrate a value-function model class from logged experience and perform\nsome type of pessimistic evaluation under the learned model, have emerged as a\npromising paradigm for batch RL. However, contemporary works on this stream\nhave commonly overlooked the hierarchical decision-making structure hidden in\nthe optimization landscape. In this paper, we adopt a game-theoretical\nviewpoint and model the policy learning diagram as a two-player general-sum\ngame with a leader-follower structure. We propose a novel stochastic\ngradient-based learning algorithm: StackelbergLearner, in which the leader\nplayer updates according to the total derivative of its objective instead of\nthe usual individual gradient, and the follower player makes individual updates\nand ensures transition-consistent pessimistic reasoning. The derived learning\ndynamic naturally lends StackelbergLearner to a game-theoretic interpretation\nand provides a convergence guarantee to differentiable Stackelberg equilibria.\nFrom a theoretical standpoint, we provide instance-dependent regret bounds with\ngeneral function approximation, which shows that our algorithm can learn a\nbest-effort policy that is able to compete against any comparator policy that\nis covered by batch data. Notably, our theoretical regret guarantees only\nrequire realizability without any data coverage and strong function\napproximation conditions, e.g., Bellman closedness, which is in contrast to\nprior works lacking such guarantees. Through comprehensive experiments, we find\nthat our algorithm consistently performs as well or better as compared to\nstate-of-the-art methods in batch RL benchmark and real-world datasets.",

Even in regions where training data are\nsparse, the RMSE can reach 0.1 dex. It outperforms not only the K-nearest\nneighbor-based model ($\\textit{The SWAN}$) but also state-of-the-art CNNs.\nAblation studies confirm that the efficacy of the models in this particular\ntask is strongly influenced by the size of their receptive fields, with larger\nreceptive fields correlating with enhanced performance. Moreover, we find that\nthe attention mechanisms within $\\textit{Astroconformer}$ are well-aligned with\nthe inherent characteristics of stellar oscillations and granulation present in\nthe light curves.",

In this work, we systematically\nexamine the impact of methodological details in activation patching, including\nevaluation metrics and corruption methods.

          "description": "Worldwide Geo-localization aims to pinpoint the precise location of images\ntaken anywhere on Earth. This task has considerable challenges due to immense\nvariation in geographic landscapes. The image-to-image retrieval-based\napproaches fail to solve this problem on a global scale as it is not feasible\nto construct a large gallery of images covering the entire world. Instead,\nexisting approaches divide the globe into discrete geographic cells,\ntransforming the problem into a classification task. However, their performance\nis limited by the predefined classes and often results in inaccurate\nlocalizations when an image's location significantly deviates from its class\ncenter. To overcome these limitations, we propose GeoCLIP, a novel\nCLIP-inspired Image-to-GPS retrieval approach that enforces alignment between\nthe image and its corresponding GPS locations. GeoCLIP's location encoder\nmodels the Earth as a continuous function by employing positional encoding\nthrough random Fourier features and constructing a hierarchical representation\nthat captures information at varying resolutions to yield a semantically rich\nhigh-dimensional feature suitable to use even beyond geo-localization. To the\nbest of our knowledge, this is the first work employing GPS encoding for\ngeo-localization. We demonstrate the efficacy of our method via extensive\nexperiments and ablations on benchmark datasets. We achieve competitive\nperformance with just 20% of training data, highlighting its effectiveness even\nin limited-data settings. Furthermore, we qualitatively demonstrate\ngeo-localization using a text query by leveraging CLIP backbone of our image\nencoder.",

Given the existence of data censoring,\nan effective way of survival analysis is to enforce the pairwise temporal\nconcordance between censored and observed data, aiming to utilize the time\ninterval before censoring as partially observed time-to-event labels for\nsupervised learning. Although existing studies mostly employed ranking methods\nto pursue an ordering objective, contrastive methods which learn a\ndiscriminative embedding by having data contrast against each other, have not\nbeen explored thoroughly for survival analysis. Therefore, in this paper, we\npropose a novel Ontology-aware Temporality-based Contrastive Survival (OTCSurv)\nanalysis framework that utilizes survival durations from both censored and\nobserved data to define temporal distinctiveness and construct negative sample\npairs with adjustable hardness for contrastive learning.

Second, we design a temporal\ncontrastive loss to capture varying survival durations in a supervised setting\nthrough a hardness-aware negative sampling mechanism. Last, we incorporate the\ncontrastive task into the time-to-event predictive task with multiple loss\ncomponents. We conduct extensive experiments using a large EHR dataset to\nforecast the risk of hospitalized patients who are in danger of developing\nacute kidney injury (AKI), a critical and urgent medical condition.

          "description": "Developing the next generation of household robot helpers requires combining\nlocomotion and interaction capabilities, which is generally referred to as\nmobile manipulation (MoMa). MoMa tasks are difficult due to the large action\nspace of the robot and the common multi-objective nature of the task, e.g.,\nefficiently reaching a goal while avoiding obstacles. Current approaches often\nsegregate tasks into navigation without manipulation and stationary\nmanipulation without locomotion by manually matching parts of the action space\nto MoMa sub-objectives (e.g. learning base actions for locomotion objectives\nand learning arm actions for manipulation). This solution prevents simultaneous\ncombinations of locomotion and interaction degrees of freedom and requires\nhuman domain knowledge for both partitioning the action space and matching the\naction parts to the sub-objectives. In this paper, we introduce Causal MoMa, a\nnew reinforcement learning framework to train policies for typical MoMa tasks\nthat makes use of the most favorable subspace of the robot's action space to\naddress each sub-objective. Causal MoMa automatically discovers the causal\ndependencies between actions and terms of the reward function and exploits\nthese dependencies through causal policy gradient that reduces gradient\nvariance compared to previous state-of-the-art reinforcement learning\nalgorithms, improving convergence and results. We evaluate the performance of\nCausal MoMa on three types of simulated robots across different MoMa tasks and\ndemonstrate success in transferring the policies trained in simulation directly\nto a real robot, where our agent is able to follow moving goals and react to\ndynamic obstacles while simultaneously and synergistically controlling the\nwhole-body: base, arm, and head.

          "description": "A typical machine learning (ML) development cycle for edge computing is to\nmaximise the performance during model training and then minimise the\nmemory/area footprint of the trained model for deployment on edge devices\ntargeting CPUs, GPUs, microcontrollers, or custom hardware accelerators. This\npaper proposes a methodology for automatically generating predictor circuits\nfor classification of tabular data with comparable prediction performance to\nconventional ML techniques while using substantially fewer hardware resources\nand power. The proposed methodology uses an evolutionary algorithm to search\nover the space of logic gates and automatically generates a classifier circuit\nwith maximised training prediction accuracy. Classifier circuits are so tiny\n(i.e., consisting of no more than 300 logic gates) that they are called \"Tiny\nClassifier\" circuits, and can efficiently be implemented in ASIC or on an FPGA.\nWe empirically evaluate the automatic Tiny Classifier circuit generation\nmethodology or \"Auto Tiny Classifiers\" on a wide range of tabular datasets, and\ncompare it against conventional ML techniques such as Amazon's AutoGluon,\nGoogle's TabNet and a neural search over Multi-Layer Perceptrons. Despite Tiny\nClassifiers being constrained to a few hundred logic gates, we observe no\nstatistically significant difference in prediction performance in comparison to\nthe best-performing ML baseline. When synthesised as a Silicon chip, Tiny\nClassifiers use 8-18x less area and 4-8x less power. When implemented as an\nultra-low cost chip on a flexible substrate (i.e., FlexIC), they occupy 10-75x\nless area and consume 13-75x less power compared to the most hardware-efficient\nML baseline. On an FPGA, Tiny Classifiers consume 3-11x fewer resources.",

          "description": "Contrastive learning is a self-supervised representation learning framework,\nwhere two positive views generated through data augmentation are made similar\nby an attraction force in a data representation space, while a repulsive force\nmakes them far from negative examples. Non-contrastive learning, represented by\nBYOL and SimSiam, further gets rid of negative examples and improves\ncomputational efficiency. While learned representations may collapse into a\nsingle point due to the lack of the repulsive force at first sight, Tian et al.\n(2021) revealed through the learning dynamics analysis that the representations\ncan avoid collapse if data augmentation is sufficiently stronger than\nregularization. However, their analysis does not take into account\ncommonly-used feature normalization, a normalizer before measuring the\nsimilarity of representations, and hence excessively strong regularization may\ncollapse the dynamics, which is an unnatural behavior under the presence of\nfeature normalization. Therefore, we extend the previous theory based on the L2\nloss by considering the cosine loss, which involves feature normalization. We\nshow that the cosine loss induces sixth-order dynamics (while the L2 loss\ninduces a third-order one), in which a stable equilibrium dynamically emerges\neven if there are only collapsed solutions with given initial parameters. Thus,\nwe offer a new understanding that feature normalization plays an important role\nin robustly preventing the dynamics collapse.",

          "description": "Offline Reinforcement Learning (RL) has emerged as a promising framework for\nlearning policies without active interactions, making it especially appealing\nfor autonomous driving tasks. Recent successes of Transformers inspire casting\noffline RL as sequence modeling, which performs well in long-horizon tasks.\nHowever, they are overly optimistic in stochastic environments with incorrect\nassumptions that the same goal can be consistently achieved by identical\nactions. In this paper, we introduce an UNcertainty-awaRE deciSion Transformer\n(UNREST) for planning in stochastic driving environments without introducing\nadditional transition or complex generative models. Specifically, UNREST\nestimates state uncertainties by the conditional mutual information between\ntransitions and returns, and segments sequences accordingly. Discovering the\n`uncertainty accumulation' and `temporal locality' properties of driving\nenvironments, UNREST replaces the global returns in decision transformers with\nless uncertain truncated returns, to learn from true outcomes of agent actions\nrather than environment transitions. We also dynamically evaluate environmental\nuncertainty during inference for cautious planning. Extensive experimental\nresults demonstrate UNREST's superior performance in various driving scenarios\nand the power of our uncertainty estimation strategy.",

In this work,\nwe address the problem of learning a dissipative neural dynamical system model\nin two stages. First, we learn an unconstrained neural dynamical model that\nclosely approximates the system dynamics. Next, we derive sufficient conditions\nto perturb the weights of the neural dynamical model to ensure dissipativity,\nfollowed by perturbation of the biases to retain the fit of the model to the\ntrajectories of the nonlinear system.

The designed methodology is particularly suited for the control of\nsystems learned by Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), which are known for their\nenhanced modeling capabilities and for which the incremental ISS properties can\nbe studied thanks to simple algebraic conditions. The approach is applied to\nGated Recurrent Unit (GRU) networks, providing also a method for the design of\na tailored state observer with convergence guarantees. The resulting control\narchitecture is tested on a benchmark system, demonstrating its good control\nperformances and efficient applicability.",

          "description": "Unsupervised learning allows us to leverage unlabelled data, which has become\nabundantly available, and to create embeddings that are usable on a variety of\ndownstream tasks. However, the typical lack of interpretability of unsupervised\nrepresentation learning has become a limiting factor with regard to recent\ntransparent-AI regulations. In this paper, we study graph representation\nlearning and we show that data augmentation that preserves semantics can be\nlearned and used to produce interpretations. Our framework, which we named\nINGENIOUS, creates inherently interpretable embeddings and eliminates the need\nfor costly additional post-hoc analysis. We also introduce additional metrics\naddressing the lack of formalism and metrics in the understudied area of\nunsupervised-representation learning interpretability. Our results are\nsupported by an experimental study applied to both graph-level and node-level\ntasks and show that interpretable embeddings provide state-of-the-art\nperformance on subsequent downstream tasks.",

To address this\nchallenge, algorithms must produce features for every claim that are both\nsemantically meaningful, and compact enough to find a semantic alignment with\nthe source information. In contrast to previous work, which tackled the\nalignment problem by learning over annotated corpora of claims and their\ncorresponding labels, we propose SFAVEL (Self-supervised Fact Verification via\nLanguage Model Distillation), a novel unsupervised framework that leverages\npre-trained language models to distil self-supervised features into\nhigh-quality claim-fact alignments without the need for annotations. This is\nenabled by a novel contrastive loss function that encourages features to attain\nhigh-quality claim and evidence alignments whilst preserving the semantic\nrelationships across the corpora.

During\nthe early days of the pandemic, one of the biggest challenges we faced was the\nlack of peer-reviewed biomedical articles on COVID-19 that could be used to\ntrain machine learning models for question answering (QA). In this paper, we\nexplore the roles weak supervision and data augmentation play in training deep\nneural network QA models. First, we investigate whether labels generated\nautomatically from the structured abstracts of scholarly papers using an\ninformation retrieval algorithm, BM25, provide a weak supervision signal to\ntrain an extractive QA model. We also curate new QA pairs using information\nretrieval techniques, guided by the clinicaltrials.gov schema and the\nstructured abstracts of articles, in the absence of annotated data from\nbiomedical domain experts. Furthermore, we explore augmenting the training data\nof a deep neural network model with linguistic features from external sources\nsuch as lexical databases to account for variations in word morphology and\nmeaning. To better utilize our training data, we apply curriculum learning to\ndomain adaptation, fine-tuning our QA model in stages based on characteristics\nof the QA pairs. We evaluate our methods in the context of QA models at the\ncore of a system to answer questions about COVID-19.",

Machine learning methods have shown promising results in\nevaluating the risk of developing atrial fibrillation from the\nelectrocardiogram. We aim to develop and evaluate one such algorithm on a large\nCODE dataset collected in Brazil.\n\nResults: The deep neural network model identified patients without indication\nof AF in the presented ECG but who will develop AF in the future with an AUC\nscore of 0.845. From our survival model, we obtain that patients in the\nhigh-risk group (i.e. with the probability of a future AF case being greater\nthan 0.7) are 50% more likely to develop AF within 40 weeks, while patients\nbelonging to the minimal-risk group (i.e. with the probability of a future AF\ncase being less than or equal to 0.1) have more than 85% chance of remaining AF\nfree up until after seven years.\n\nConclusion: We developed and validated a model for AF risk prediction. If\napplied in clinical practice, the model possesses the potential of providing\nvaluable and useful information in decision-making and patient management\nprocesses.",

          "description": "Decoding memory content from brain activity during sleep has long been a goal\nin neuroscience. While spontaneous reactivation of memories during sleep in\nrodents is known to support memory consolidation and offline learning,\ncapturing memory replay in humans is challenging due to the absence of\nwell-annotated sleep datasets and the substantial differences in neural\npatterns between wakefulness and sleep. To address these challenges, we\ndesigned a novel cognitive neuroscience experiment and collected a\ncomprehensive, well-annotated electroencephalography (EEG) dataset from 52\nsubjects during both wakefulness and sleep. Leveraging this benchmark dataset,\nwe developed the Universal Sleep Decoder (USD) to align neural representations\nbetween wakefulness and sleep across subjects. Our model achieves up to 16.6%\ntop-1 zero-shot accuracy on unseen subjects, comparable to decoding\nperformances using individual sleep data. Furthermore, fine-tuning USD on test\nsubjects enhances decoding accuracy to 25.9% top-1 accuracy, a substantial\nimprovement over the baseline chance of 6.7%. Model comparison and ablation\nanalyses reveal that our design choices, including the use of (i) an additional\ncontrastive objective to integrate awake and sleep neural signals and (ii) the\npretrain-finetune paradigm to incorporate different subjects, significantly\ncontribute to these performances.

          "description": "Robots with increasing autonomy progress our space exploration capabilities,\nparticularly for in-situ exploration and sampling to stand in for human\nexplorers. Currently, humans drive robots to meet scientific objectives, but\ndepending on the robot's location, the exchange of information and driving\ncommands between the human operator and robot may cause undue delays in mission\nfulfillment. An autonomous robot encoded with a scientific objective and an\nexploration strategy incurs no communication delays and can fulfill missions\nmore quickly. Active learning algorithms offer this capability of intelligent\nexploration, but the underlying model structure varies the performance of the\nactive learning algorithm in accurately forming an understanding of the\nenvironment. In this paper, we investigate the performance differences between\nactive learning algorithms driven by Gaussian processes or Bayesian neural\nnetworks for exploration strategies encoded on agents that are constrained in\ntheir trajectories, like planetary surface rovers. These two active learning\nstrategies were tested in a simulation environment against science-blind\nstrategies to predict the spatial distribution of a variable of interest along\nmultiple datasets. The performance metrics of interest are model accuracy in\nroot mean squared (RMS) error, training time, model convergence, total distance\ntraveled until convergence, and total samples until convergence. Active\nlearning strategies encoded with Gaussian processes require less computation to\ntrain, converge to an accurate model more quickly, and propose trajectories of\nshorter distance, except in a few complex environments in which Bayesian neural\nnetworks achieve a more accurate model in the large data regime due to their\nmore expressive functional bases. The paper concludes with advice on when and\nhow to implement either exploration strategy for future space missions.",

          "description": "Recent advances in federated learning (FL) enable collaborative training of\nmachine learning (ML) models from large-scale and widely dispersed clients\nwhile protecting their privacy. However, when different clients' datasets are\nheterogeneous, traditional FL mechanisms produce a global model that does not\nadequately represent the poorer clients with limited data resources, resulting\nin lower accuracy and higher bias on their local data. According to the Matthew\neffect, which describes how the advantaged gain more advantage and the\ndisadvantaged lose more over time, deploying such a global model in client\napplications may worsen the resource disparity among the clients and harm the\nprinciples of social welfare and fairness. To mitigate the Matthew effect, we\npropose Egalitarian Fairness Federated Learning (EFFL), where egalitarian\nfairness refers to the global model learned from FL has: (1) equal accuracy\namong clients; (2) equal decision bias among clients. Besides achieving\negalitarian fairness among the clients, EFFL also aims for performance\noptimality, minimizing the empirical risk loss and the bias for each client;\nboth are essential for any ML model training, whether centralized or\ndecentralized. We formulate EFFL as a constrained multi-constrained\nmulti-objectives optimization (MCMOO) problem, with the decision bias and\negalitarian fairness as constraints and the minimization of the empirical risk\nlosses on all clients as multiple objectives to be optimized. We propose a\ngradient-based three-stage algorithm to obtain the Pareto optimal solutions\nwithin the constraint space. Extensive experiments demonstrate that EFFL\noutperforms other state-of-the-art FL algorithms in achieving a\nhigh-performance global model with enhanced egalitarian fairness among all\nclients.",

          "description": "High training costs of generative models and the need to fine-tune them for\nspecific tasks have created a strong interest in model reuse and composition. A\nkey challenge in composing iterative generative processes, such as GFlowNets\nand diffusion models, is that to realize the desired target distribution, all\nsteps of the generative process need to be coordinated, and satisfy delicate\nbalance conditions. In this work, we propose Compositional Sculpting: a general\napproach for defining compositions of iterative generative processes. We then\nintroduce a method for sampling from these compositions built on classifier\nguidance. We showcase ways to accomplish compositional sculpting in both\nGFlowNets and diffusion models. We highlight two binary operations\n$\\unicode{x2014}$ the harmonic mean ($p_1 \\otimes p_2$) and the contrast ($p_1\n\\unicode{x25D1}\\,p_2$) between pairs, and the generalization of these\noperations to multiple component distributions.

          "description": "The increasing capabilities of large language models (LLMs) raise\nopportunities for artificial general intelligence but concurrently amplify\nsafety concerns, such as potential misuse of AI systems, necessitating\neffective AI alignment. Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) has\nemerged as a promising pathway towards AI alignment but brings forth challenges\ndue to its complexity and dependence on a separate reward model. Direct\nPreference Optimization (DPO) has been proposed as an alternative, and it\nremains equivalent to RLHF under the reverse KL regularization constraint. This\npaper presents $f$-DPO, a generalized approach to DPO by incorporating diverse\ndivergence constraints. We show that under certain $f$-divergences, including\nJensen-Shannon divergence, forward KL divergences and $\\alpha$-divergences, the\ncomplex relationship between the reward and optimal policy can also be\nsimplified by addressing the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker conditions. This eliminates the\nneed for estimating the normalizing constant in the Bradley-Terry model and\nenables a tractable mapping between the reward function and the optimal policy.\nOur approach optimizes LLMs to align with human preferences in a more efficient\nand supervised manner under a broad set of divergence constraints. Empirically,\nadopting these divergences ensures a balance between alignment performance and\ngeneration diversity. Importantly, $f$-DPO outperforms PPO-based methods in\ndivergence efficiency, and divergence constraints directly influence expected\ncalibration error (ECE).",

          "description": "Time series data can be found in almost every domain, ranging from the\nmedical field to manufacturing and wireless communication. Generating realistic\nand useful exemplars and prototypes is a fundamental data analysis task. In\nthis paper, we investigate a novel approach to generating realistic and useful\nexemplars and prototypes for time series data. Our approach uses a new form of\ntime series average, the ShapeDTW Barycentric Average. We therefore turn our\nattention to accurately generating time series prototypes with a novel\napproach. The existing time series prototyping approaches rely on the Dynamic\nTime Warping (DTW) similarity measure such as DTW Barycentering Average (DBA)\nand SoftDBA. These last approaches suffer from a common problem of generating\nout-of-distribution artifacts in their prototypes. This is mostly caused by the\nDTW variant used and its incapability of detecting neighborhood similarities,\ninstead it detects absolute similarities. Our proposed method, ShapeDBA, uses\nthe ShapeDTW variant of DTW, that overcomes this issue. We chose time series\nclustering, a popular form of time series analysis to evaluate the outcome of\nShapeDBA compared to the other prototyping approaches. Coupled with the k-means\nclustering algorithm, and evaluated on a total of 123 datasets from the UCR\narchive, our proposed averaging approach is able to achieve new\nstate-of-the-art results in terms of Adjusted Rand Index.",

          "description": "The standard paired-sample testing approach in the multidimensional setting\napplies multiple univariate tests on the individual features, followed by\np-value adjustments. Such an approach suffers when the data carry numerous\nfeatures. A number of studies have shown that classification accuracy can be\nseen as a proxy for two-sample testing. However, neither theoretical\nfoundations nor practical recipes have been proposed so far on how this\nstrategy could be extended to multidimensional paired-sample testing. In this\nwork, we put forward the idea that scoring functions can be produced by the\ndecision rules defined by the perpendicular bisecting hyperplanes of the line\nsegments connecting each pair of instances. Then, the optimal scoring function\ncan be obtained by the pseudomedian of those rules, which we estimate by\nextending naturally the Hodges-Lehmann estimator. We accordingly propose a\nframework of a two-step testing procedure. First, we estimate the bisecting\nhyperplanes for each pair of instances and an aggregated rule derived through\nthe Hodges-Lehmann estimator. The paired samples are scored by this aggregated\nrule to produce a unidimensional representation. Second, we perform a Wilcoxon\nsigned-rank test on the obtained representation.

          "description": "Diverse explainability methods of graph neural networks (GNN) have recently\nbeen developed to highlight the edges and nodes in the graph that contribute\nthe most to the model predictions. However, it is not clear yet how to evaluate\nthe correctness of those explanations, whether it is from a human or a model\nperspective. One unaddressed bottleneck in the current evaluation procedure is\nthe problem of out-of-distribution explanations, whose distribution differs\nfrom those of the training data. This important issue affects existing\nevaluation metrics such as the popular faithfulness or fidelity score. In this\npaper, we show the limitations of faithfulness metrics. We propose GInX-Eval\n(Graph In-distribution eXplanation Evaluation), an evaluation procedure of\ngraph explanations that overcomes the pitfalls of faithfulness and offers new\ninsights on explainability methods. Using a retraining strategy, the GInX score\nmeasures how informative removed edges are for the model and the EdgeRank score\nevaluates if explanatory edges are correctly ordered by their importance.\nGInX-Eval verifies if ground-truth explanations are instructive to the GNN\nmodel. In addition, it shows that many popular methods, including\ngradient-based methods, produce explanations that are not better than a random\ndesignation of edges as important subgraphs, challenging the findings of\ncurrent works in the area.

          "description": "In representation learning, regression has traditionally received less\nattention than classification. Directly applying representation learning\ntechniques designed for classification to regression often results in\nfragmented representations in the latent space, yielding sub-optimal\nperformance. In this paper, we argue that the potential of contrastive learning\nfor regression has been overshadowed due to the neglect of two crucial aspects:\nordinality-awareness and hardness. To address these challenges, we advocate\n\"mixup your own contrastive pairs for supervised contrastive regression\",\ninstead of relying solely on real/augmented samples. Specifically, we propose\nSupervised Contrastive Learning for Regression with Mixup (SupReMix). It takes\nanchor-inclusive mixtures (mixup of the anchor and a distinct negative sample)\nas hard negative pairs and anchor-exclusive mixtures (mixup of two distinct\nnegative samples) as hard positive pairs at the embedding level. This strategy\nformulates harder contrastive pairs by integrating richer ordinal information.\nThrough extensive experiments on six regression datasets including 2D images,\nvolumetric images, text, tabular data, and time-series signals, coupled with\ntheoretical analysis, we demonstrate that SupReMix pre-training fosters\ncontinuous ordered representations of regression data, resulting in significant\nimprovement in regression performance. Furthermore, SupReMix is superior to\nother approaches in a range of regression challenges including transfer\nlearning, imbalanced training data, and scenarios with fewer training samples.",

          "description": "Standard practice within Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF)\ninvolves optimizing against a Reward Model (RM), which itself is trained to\nreflect human preferences for desirable generations. A notable subject that is\nunderstudied is the (in-)consistency of RMs -- whether they can recognize the\nsemantic changes to different prompts and appropriately adapt their reward\nassignments -- and their impact on the downstream RLHF model.\n\nIn this paper, we visit a series of research questions relevant to RM\ninconsistency: (1) How can we measure the consistency of reward models? (2) How\nconsistent are the existing RMs and how can we improve them? (3) In what ways\ndoes reward inconsistency influence the chatbots resulting from the RLHF model\ntraining?\n\nWe propose Contrast Instructions -- a benchmarking strategy for the\nconsistency of RM. Each example in Contrast Instructions features a pair of\nlexically similar instructions with different ground truth responses. A\nconsistent RM is expected to rank the corresponding instruction and response\nhigher than other combinations. We observe that current RMs trained with the\nstandard ranking objective fail miserably on Contrast Instructions compared to\naverage humans. To show that RM consistency can be improved efficiently without\nusing extra training budget, we propose two techniques ConvexDA and\nRewardFusion, which enhance reward consistency through extrapolation during the\nRM training and inference stage, respectively. We show that RLHF models trained\nwith a more consistent RM yield more useful responses, suggesting that reward\ninconsistency exhibits a trickle-down effect on the downstream RLHF process.",

          "description": "Anomaly detection is critical to ensure the security of cyber-physical\nsystems (CPS). However, due to the increasing complexity of attacks and CPS\nthemselves, anomaly detection in CPS is becoming more and more challenging. In\nour previous work, we proposed a digital twin-based anomaly detection method,\ncalled ATTAIN, which takes advantage of both historical and real-time data of\nCPS. However, such data vary significantly in terms of difficulty. Therefore,\nsimilar to human learning processes, deep learning models (e.g., ATTAIN) can\nbenefit from an easy-to-difficult curriculum. To this end, in this paper, we\npresent a novel approach, named digitaL twin-based Anomaly deTecTion wIth\nCurriculum lEarning (LATTICE), which extends ATTAIN by introducing curriculum\nlearning to optimize its learning paradigm. LATTICE attributes each sample with\na difficulty score, before being fed into a training scheduler. The training\nscheduler samples batches of training data based on these difficulty scores\nsuch that learning from easy to difficult data can be performed. To evaluate\nLATTICE, we use five publicly available datasets collected from five real-world\nCPS testbeds. We compare LATTICE with ATTAIN and two other state-of-the-art\nanomaly detectors. Evaluation results show that LATTICE outperforms the three\nbaselines and ATTAIN by 0.906%-2.367% in terms of the F1 score. LATTICE also,\non average, reduces the training time of ATTAIN by 4.2% on the five datasets\nand is on par with the baselines in terms of detection delay time.",

Our analysis,\nbased on data collected from 669 patients across various provinces in Iraq,\nyielded valuable insights. We found that age, gender, and geographical region\nof residence were significant demographic factors influencing the likelihood of\ndeveloping mental health disorders in post-COVID-19 patients. Additionally,\ncomorbidities and the severity of COVID-19 illness were important clinical\npredictors. Psychosocial factors, such as social support, coping strategies,\nand perceived stress levels, also played a substantial role. Our findings\nemphasize the complex interplay of multiple factors in the development of\nmental health disorders following COVID-19 recovery. Healthcare providers and\npolicymakers should consider these risk factors when designing targeted\ninterventions and support systems for individuals at risk. Machine\nlearning-based approaches can provide a valuable tool for predicting and\npreventing adverse mental health outcomes in post-COVID-19 patients. Further\nresearch and prospective studies are needed to validate these findings and\nenhance our understanding of the long-term psychological impact of the COVID-19\npandemic.

          "description": "Decision forests are widely used for classification and regression tasks. A\nlesser known property of tree-based methods is that one can construct a\nproximity matrix from the tree(s), and these proximity matrices are induced\nkernels. While there has been extensive research on the applications and\nproperties of kernels, there is relatively little research on kernels induced\nby decision forests. We construct Kernel Mean Embedding Random Forests (KMERF),\nwhich induce kernels from random trees and/or forests using leaf-node\nproximity. We introduce the notion of an asymptotically characteristic kernel,\nand prove that KMERF kernels are asymptotically characteristic for both\ndiscrete and continuous data. Because KMERF is data-adaptive, we suspected it\nwould outperform kernels selected a priori on finite sample data. We illustrate\nthat KMERF nearly dominates current state-of-the-art kernel-based tests across\na diverse range of high-dimensional two-sample and independence testing\nsettings. Furthermore, our forest-based approach is interpretable, and provides\nfeature importance metrics that readily distinguish important dimensions,\nunlike other high-dimensional non-parametric testing procedures. Hence, this\nwork demonstrates the decision forest-based kernel can be more powerful and\nmore interpretable than existing methods, flying in the face of conventional\nwisdom of the trade-off between the two.",

          "description": "Modern DNN-based recommendation systems rely on training-derived embeddings\nof sparse features. Input sparsity makes obtaining high-quality embeddings for\nrarely-occurring categories harder as their representations are updated\ninfrequently. We demonstrate a training-time technique to produce superior\nembeddings via effective cross-category learning and theoretically explain its\nsurprising effectiveness. The scheme, termed the multi-layer embeddings\ntraining (MLET), trains embeddings using factorization of the embedding layer,\nwith an inner dimension higher than the target embedding dimension. For\ninference efficiency, MLET converts the trained two-layer embedding into a\nsingle-layer one thus keeping inference-time model size unchanged.\n\nEmpirical superiority of MLET is puzzling as its search space is not larger\nthan that of the single-layer embedding. The strong dependence of MLET on the\ninner dimension is even more surprising. We develop a theory that explains both\nof these behaviors by showing that MLET creates an adaptive update mechanism\nmodulated by the singular vectors of embeddings. When tested on multiple\nstate-of-the-art recommendation models for click-through rate (CTR) prediction\ntasks, MLET consistently produces better models, especially for rare items. At\nconstant model quality, MLET allows embedding dimension, and model size,\nreduction by up to 16x, and 5.8x on average, across the models.",

In turn, the more surprising\nthe information required to defined the claim, the narrower its scope. Five\nlanguage models are considered, ranging from simplest models (each word or\ncharacter is assigned an identical probability) to intermediate models (using\naverage word or character frequencies), to a large language model (GPT2).\nInterestingly, the scope resulting from the simplest language models is\nproportional to the reciprocal of the number of words or characters involved in\nthe claim, a metric already used in previous works. Application is made to\nmultiple series of patent claims directed to distinct inventions, where each\nseries consists of claims devised to have a gradually decreasing scope. The\nperformance of the language models is assessed with respect to several ad hoc\ntests. The more sophisticated the model, the better the results.

Field-Programming Gate Arrays\n(FPGAs) are a promising execution platform due to their fine-grained\nparallelism, low-power consumption, reconfigurability, and concurrent\nexecution. Even better, High-Level Synthesis (HLS) tools bridge the gap between\nthe non-trivial FPGA development efforts and rapid emergence of new GNN models.\nIn this paper, we propose GNNHLS, an open-source framework to comprehensively\nevaluate GNN inference acceleration on FPGAs via HLS, containing a software\nstack for data generation and baseline deployment, and FPGA implementations of\n6 well-tuned GNN HLS kernels. We evaluate GNNHLS on 4 graph datasets with\ndistinct topologies and scales. The results show that GNNHLS achieves up to\n50.8x speedup and 423x energy reduction relative to the CPU baselines. Compared\nwith the GPU baselines, GNNHLS achieves up to 5.16x speedup and 74.5x energy\nreduction.",

In this work we\nused make transformer-based model for training. It was found through previous\nyears' competitions that basically all of the top 5 methods used CNN-based\nmethods, which is likely due to the lack of data volume that prevents\ntransformer-based methods from taking full advantage. The thousands of samples\nin this competition may enable the transformer-based model to have more\nexcellent results.

Second, given the distributed nature and graph structure\nbetween clients and nodes in the pre-processing layer, GNN is leveraged to\nidentify abnormal local models, enhancing system security. Third, DLT is\nutilized to decentralize the system by selecting one of the candidates to\nperform the central server's functions. Additionally, DLT ensures reliable data\nmanagement by recording data exchanges in an immutable and transparent ledger.\nThe feasibility of the novel architecture is validated through simulations,\ndemonstrating improved performance in anomalous model detection and global\nmodel accuracy compared to relevant baselines.",

It can act as a regularizer, but fails to do so in\ncertain high-dimensional problems, and it may shift the double-descent peak of\nan empirical risk. Overall, the analysis shows that several properties data\naugmentation has been attributed with are not either true or false, but rather\ndepend on a combination of factors -- notably the data distribution, the\nproperties of the estimator, and the interplay of sample size, number of\naugmentations, and dimension.

Assigning the location of a sensed biological event with the\nevent itself, which is the main proposition of flow-guided in-body nanoscale\nlocalization, would be immensely beneficial from the perspective of precision\nmedicine. The nanoscale nature of the nanodevices and the challenging\nenvironment that the bloodstream represents, result in current flow-guided\nlocalization approaches being constrained in their communication and\nenergy-related capabilities. The communication and energy constraints of the\nnanodevices result in different features of raw data for flow-guided\nlocalization, in turn affecting its performance. An analytical modeling of the\neffects of imperfect communication and constrained energy causing intermittent\noperation of the nanodevices on the raw data produced by the nanodevices would\nbe beneficial.

More flexible spatial\nextremes models exhibit appealing extremal dependence properties but are often\nexceedingly prohibitive to fit and simulate from in high dimensions. In this\npaper, we develop a new spatial extremes model that has flexible and\nnon-stationary dependence properties, and we integrate it in the\nencoding-decoding structure of a variational autoencoder (XVAE), whose\nparameters are estimated via variational Bayes combined with deep learning. The\nXVAE can be used as a spatio-temporal emulator that characterizes the\ndistribution of potential mechanistic model output states and produces outputs\nthat have the same statistical properties as the inputs, especially in the\ntail. As an aside, our approach also provides a novel way of making fast\ninference with complex extreme-value processes. Through extensive simulation\nstudies, we show that our XVAE is substantially more time-efficient than\ntraditional Bayesian inference while also outperforming many spatial extremes\nmodels with a stationary dependence structure. To further demonstrate the\ncomputational power of the XVAE, we analyze a high-resolution satellite-derived\ndataset of sea surface temperature in the Red Sea, which includes 30 years of\ndaily measurements at 16703 grid cells.

          "description": "The well-known governing physics in science and engineering is often based on\ncertain assumptions and approximations. Therefore, analyses and designs carried\nout based on these equations are also approximate. The emergence of data-driven\nmodels has, to a certain degree, addressed this challenge; however, the purely\ndata-driven models often (a) lack interpretability, (b) are data-hungry, and\n(c) do not generalize beyond the training window. Operator learning has\nrecently been proposed as a potential alternative to address the aforementioned\nchallenges; however, the challenges are still persistent. We here argue that\none of the possible solutions resides in data-physics fusion, where the\ndata-driven model is used to correct/identify the missing physics.

The proposed DPA-WNO blends a differentiable physics solver with the\nWavelet Neural Operator (WNO), where the role of WNO is to model the missing\nphysics. This empowers the proposed framework to exploit the capability of WNO\nto learn from data while retaining the interpretability and generalizability\nassociated with physics-based solvers. We illustrate the applicability of the\nproposed approach in solving time-dependent uncertainty quantification problems\ndue to randomness in the initial condition.

          "description": "With the rapid development of the Intelligent Transportation System (ITS),\naccurate traffic forecasting has emerged as a critical challenge. The key\nbottleneck lies in capturing the intricate spatio-temporal traffic patterns. In\nrecent years, numerous neural networks with complicated architectures have been\nproposed to address this issue. However, the advancements in network\narchitectures have encountered diminishing performance gains. In this study, we\npresent a novel component called spatio-temporal adaptive embedding that can\nyield outstanding results with vanilla transformers. Our proposed\nSpatio-Temporal Adaptive Embedding transformer (STAEformer) achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance on five real-world traffic forecasting datasets.\nFurther experiments demonstrate that spatio-temporal adaptive embedding plays a\ncrucial role in traffic forecasting by effectively capturing intrinsic\nspatio-temporal relations and chronological information in traffic time series.",

          "description": "Provenance graphs are structured audit logs that describe the history of a\nsystem's execution. Recent studies have explored a variety of techniques to\nanalyze provenance graphs for automated host intrusion detection, focusing\nparticularly on advanced persistent threats. Sifting through their design\ndocuments, we identify four common dimensions that drive the development of\nprovenance-based intrusion detection systems (PIDSes): scope (can PIDSes detect\nmodern attacks that infiltrate across application boundaries?), attack\nagnosticity (can PIDSes detect novel attacks without a priori knowledge of\nattack characteristics?), timeliness (can PIDSes efficiently monitor host\nsystems as they run?), and attack reconstruction (can PIDSes distill attack\nactivity from large provenance graphs so that sysadmins can easily understand\nand quickly respond to system intrusion?). We present KAIROS, the first PIDS\nthat simultaneously satisfies the desiderata in all four dimensions, whereas\nexisting approaches sacrifice at least one and struggle to achieve comparable\ndetection performance.\n\nKairos leverages a novel graph neural network-based encoder-decoder\narchitecture that learns the temporal evolution of a provenance graph's\nstructural changes to quantify the degree of anomalousness for each system\nevent. Then, based on this fine-grained information, Kairos reconstructs attack\nfootprints, generating compact summary graphs that accurately describe\nmalicious activity over a stream of system audit logs. Using state-of-the-art\nbenchmark datasets, we demonstrate that Kairos outperforms previous approaches.",

However, as machine\nlearning algorithms are applied in new contexts the harms and injustices that\nresult are qualitatively different than those presently studied. The existing\nresearch paradigm in machine learning which develops metrics and definitions of\nfairness cannot account for these qualitatively different types of injustice.\nOne example of this is the problem of algorithmic collusion and market\nfairness.

          "description": "In root finding and optimization, there are many cases where there is a\nclosed set $A$ one likes that the sequence constructed by one's favourite\nmethod will not converge to A (here, we do not assume extra properties on $A$\nsuch as being convex or connected). For example, if one wants to find roots,\nand one chooses initial points in the basin of attraction for 1 root $x^*$ (a\nfact which one may not know before hand), then one will always end up in that\nroot. In this case, one would like to have a mechanism to avoid this point\n$z^*$ in the next runs of one's algorithm.\n\nIn this paper, we propose two new methods aiming to achieve this. In the\nfirst method, we divide the cost function by an appropriate power of the\ndistance function to $A$. This idea is inspired by how one would try to find\nall roots of a function in 1 variable. In the second method, which is more\nsuitable for constrained optimization, we redefine the value of the function to\nbe a big constant on $A$. We also propose, based on this, an algorithm to\nescape the basin of attraction of a component of positive dimension to reach\nanother component. As an application, we prove a rigorous guarantee for finding\nroots of a meromorphic function of 1 complex variable in a given domain.\n\nAlong the way, we compare with main existing relevant methods in the current\nliterature.

Non-prehensile\nmanipulation may enable more complex interactions with the objects, but also\npresents challenges in reasoning about gripper-object interactions. In this\nwork, we introduce Hybrid Actor-Critic Maps for Manipulation (HACMan), a\nreinforcement learning approach for 6D non-prehensile manipulation of objects\nusing point cloud observations. HACMan proposes a temporally-abstracted and\nspatially-grounded object-centric action representation that consists of\nselecting a contact location from the object point cloud and a set of motion\nparameters describing how the robot will move after making contact. We modify\nan existing off-policy RL algorithm to learn in this hybrid discrete-continuous\naction representation.

          "description": "In response to recent data regulation requirements, machine unlearning (MU)\nhas emerged as a critical process to remove the influence of specific examples\nfrom a given model. Although exact unlearning can be achieved through complete\nmodel retraining using the remaining dataset, the associated computational\ncosts have driven the development of efficient, approximate unlearning\ntechniques. Moving beyond data-centric MU approaches, our study introduces a\nnovel model-based perspective: model sparsification via weight pruning, which\nis capable of reducing the gap between exact unlearning and approximate\nunlearning. We show in both theory and practice that model sparsity can boost\nthe multi-criteria unlearning performance of an approximate unlearner, closing\nthe approximation gap, while continuing to be efficient. This leads to a new MU\nparadigm, termed prune first, then unlearn, which infuses a sparse model prior\ninto the unlearning process. Building on this insight, we also develop a\nsparsity-aware unlearning method that utilizes sparsity regularization to\nenhance the training process of approximate unlearning. Extensive experiments\nshow that our proposals consistently benefit MU in various unlearning\nscenarios. A notable highlight is the 77% unlearning efficacy gain of\nfine-tuning (one of the simplest unlearning methods) when using sparsity-aware\nunlearning.

Leveraging simple proofs, we are able to\nobtain tighter results than existing results \\citep{faw2022power} and extend\nthe analysis to several new and important cases. Specifically, for the\nover-parameterized regime, we show that AdaGrad needs only\n$\\mathcal{O}(\\frac{1}{\\varepsilon^2})$ iterations to ensure the gradient norm\nsmaller than $\\varepsilon$, which matches the rate of SGD and significantly\ntighter than existing rates $\\mathcal{O}(\\frac{1}{\\varepsilon^4})$ for AdaGrad.\nWe then discard the bounded smoothness assumption and consider a realistic\nassumption on smoothness called $(L_0,L_1)$-smooth condition, which allows\nlocal smoothness to grow with the gradient norm. Again based on the auxiliary\nfunction $\\xi$, we prove that AdaGrad succeeds in converging under\n$(L_0,L_1)$-smooth condition as long as the learning rate is lower than a\nthreshold. Interestingly, we further show that the requirement on learning rate\nunder the $(L_0,L_1)$-smooth condition is necessary via proof by contradiction,\nin contrast with the case of uniform smoothness conditions where convergence is\nguaranteed regardless of learning rate choices.

          "description": "We study differentially private (DP) stochastic optimization (SO) with loss\nfunctions whose worst-case Lipschitz parameter over all data points may be\nextremely large. To date, the vast majority of work on DP SO assumes that the\nloss is uniformly Lipschitz continuous over data (i.e. stochastic gradients are\nuniformly bounded over all data points). While this assumption is convenient,\nit often leads to pessimistic excess risk bounds. In many practical problems,\nthe worst-case (uniform) Lipschitz parameter of the loss over all data points\nmay be extremely large due to outliers. In such cases, the error bounds for DP\nSO, which scale with the worst-case Lipschitz parameter of the loss, are\nvacuous. To address these limitations, this work provides near-optimal excess\nrisk bounds that do not depend on the uniform Lipschitz parameter of the loss.\nBuilding on a recent line of work (Wang et al., 2020; Kamath et al., 2022), we\nassume that stochastic gradients have bounded $k$-th order moments for some $k\n\\geq 2$. Compared with works on uniformly Lipschitz DP SO, our excess risk\nscales with the $k$-th moment bound instead of the uniform Lipschitz parameter\nof the loss, allowing for significantly faster rates in the presence of\noutliers and/or heavy-tailed data. For convex and strongly convex loss\nfunctions, we provide the first asymptotically optimal excess risk bounds (up\nto a logarithmic factor). In contrast to (Wang et al., 2020; Kamath et al.,\n2022), our bounds do not require the loss function to be differentiable/smooth.\nWe also devise a linear-time algorithm for smooth losses that has excess risk\nthat is tight in certain practical parameter regimes. Additionally, our work is\nthe first to address non-convex non-uniformly Lipschitz loss functions\nsatisfying the Proximal-PL inequality; this covers some practical machine\nlearning models. Our Proximal-PL algorithm has near-optimal excess risk.",

          "description": "In many real-world tasks, the concerned objects can be represented as a\nmulti-instance bag associated with a candidate label set, which consists of one\nground-truth label and several false positive labels. Multi-instance\npartial-label learning (MIPL) is a learning paradigm to deal with such tasks\nand has achieved favorable performances. Existing MIPL approach follows the\ninstance-space paradigm by assigning augmented candidate label sets of bags to\neach instance and aggregating bag-level labels from instance-level labels.\nHowever, this scheme may be suboptimal as global bag-level information is\nignored and the predicted labels of bags are sensitive to predictions of\nnegative instances. In this paper, we study an alternative scheme where a\nmulti-instance bag is embedded into a single vector representation.\nAccordingly, an intuitive algorithm named DEMIPL, i.e., Disambiguated attention\nEmbedding for Multi-Instance Partial-Label learning, is proposed. DEMIPL\nemploys a disambiguation attention mechanism to aggregate a multi-instance bag\ninto a single vector representation, followed by a momentum-based\ndisambiguation strategy to identify the ground-truth label from the candidate\nlabel set. Furthermore, we introduce a real-world MIPL dataset for colorectal\ncancer classification. Experimental results on benchmark and real-world\ndatasets validate the superiority of DEMIPL against the compared MIPL and\npartial-label learning approaches.",

However, most existing\nmethods for detecting distribution shift are not well-suited to robotics\nsettings, where data often arrives in a streaming fashion and may be very\nhigh-dimensional. In this work, we present an online method for detecting\ndistribution shift with guarantees on the false positive rate - i.e., when\nthere is no distribution shift, our system is very unlikely (with probability\n$< \\epsilon$) to falsely issue an alert; any alerts that are issued should\ntherefore be heeded. Our method is specifically designed for efficient\ndetection even with high dimensional data, and it empirically achieves up to\n11x faster detection on realistic robotics settings compared to prior work\nwhile maintaining a low false negative rate in practice (whenever there is a\ndistribution shift in our experiments, our method indeed emits an alert). We\ndemonstrate our approach in both simulation and hardware for a visual servoing\ntask, and show that our method indeed issues an alert before a failure occurs.",

In practice, the\nvariance on some data examples is so large that decisions can be effectively\narbitrary. To investigate this problem, we take an experimental approach and\nmake four overarching contributions: We 1) Define a metric called\nself-consistency, derived from variance, which we use as a proxy for measuring\nand reducing arbitrariness; 2) Develop an ensembling algorithm that abstains\nfrom classification when a prediction would be arbitrary; 3) Conduct the\nlargest to-date empirical study of the role of variance (vis-a-vis\nself-consistency and arbitrariness) in fair classification; and, 4) Release a\ntoolkit that makes the US Home Mortgage Disclosure Act (HMDA) datasets easily\nusable for future research. Altogether, our experiments reveal shocking\ninsights about the reliability of conclusions on benchmark datasets. Most\nfairness classification benchmarks are close-to-fair when taking into account\nthe amount of arbitrariness present in predictions -- before we even try to\napply common fairness interventions.

          "description": "The soft Dice loss (SDL) has taken a pivotal role in numerous automated\nsegmentation pipelines in the medical imaging community. Over the last years,\nsome reasons behind its superior functioning have been uncovered and further\noptimizations have been explored. However, there is currently no implementation\nthat supports its direct utilization in scenarios involving soft labels. Hence,\na synergy between the use of SDL and research leveraging the use of soft\nlabels, also in the context of model calibration, is still missing. In this\nwork, we introduce Dice semimetric losses (DMLs), which (i) are by design\nidentical to SDL in a standard setting with hard labels, but (ii) can be\nemployed in settings with soft labels. Our experiments on the public QUBIQ,\nLiTS and KiTS benchmarks confirm the potential synergy of DMLs with soft labels\n(e.g.\\ averaging, label smoothing, and knowledge distillation) over hard labels\n(e.g.\\ majority voting and random selection). As a result, we obtain superior\nDice scores and model calibration, which supports the wider adoption of DMLs in\npractice.

          "description": "Scene representation has been a crucial design choice in robotic manipulation\nsystems. An ideal representation should be 3D, dynamic, and semantic to meet\nthe demands of diverse manipulation tasks. However, previous works often lack\nall three properties simultaneously. In this work, we introduce D$^3$Fields -\ndynamic 3D descriptor fields. These fields capture the dynamics of the\nunderlying 3D environment and encode both semantic features and instance masks.\nSpecifically, we project arbitrary 3D points in the workspace onto multi-view\n2D visual observations and interpolate features derived from foundational\nmodels. The resulting fused descriptor fields allow for flexible goal\nspecifications using 2D images with varied contexts, styles, and instances. To\nevaluate the effectiveness of these descriptor fields, we apply our\nrepresentation to a wide range of robotic manipulation tasks in a zero-shot\nmanner. Through extensive evaluation in both real-world scenarios and\nsimulations, we demonstrate that D$^3$Fields are both generalizable and\neffective for zero-shot robotic manipulation tasks. In quantitative comparisons\nwith state-of-the-art dense descriptors, such as Dense Object Nets and DINO,\nD$^3$Fields exhibit significantly better generalization abilities and\nmanipulation accuracy.",

          "description": "Existing approaches defend against backdoor attacks in federated learning\n(FL) mainly through a) mitigating the impact of infected models, or b)\nexcluding infected models. The former negatively impacts model accuracy, while\nthe latter usually relies on globally clear boundaries between benign and\ninfected model updates. However, model updates are easy to be mixed and\nscattered throughout in reality due to the diverse distributions of local data.\nThis work focuses on excluding infected models in FL. Unlike previous\nperspectives from a global view, we propose Snowball, a novel anti-backdoor FL\nframework through bidirectional elections from an individual perspective\ninspired by one principle deduced by us and two principles in FL and deep\nlearning. It is characterized by a) bottom-up election, where each candidate\nmodel update votes to several peer ones such that a few model updates are\nelected as selectees for aggregation; and b) top-down election, where selectees\nprogressively enlarge themselves through picking up from the candidates. We\ncompare Snowball with state-of-the-art defenses to backdoor attacks in FL on\nfive real-world datasets, demonstrating its superior resistance to backdoor\nattacks and slight impact on the accuracy of the global model.",

          "description": "Parallelization techniques have become ubiquitous for accelerating inference\nand training of deep neural networks. Despite this, several operations are\nstill performed in a sequential manner. For instance, the forward and backward\npasses are executed layer-by-layer, and the output of diffusion models is\nproduced by applying a sequence of denoising steps. This sequential approach\nresults in a computational cost proportional to the number of steps involved,\npresenting a potential bottleneck as the number of steps increases. In this\nwork, we introduce DeepPCR, a novel algorithm which parallelizes typically\nsequential operations used in inference and training of neural networks.\nDeepPCR is based on interpreting a sequence of $L$ steps as the solution of a\nspecific system of equations, which we recover using the Parallel Cyclic\nReduction algorithm. This reduces the complexity of computing the sequential\noperations from $\\mathcal{O}(L)$ to $\\mathcal{O}(\\log_2L)$, thus yielding a\nspeedup for large $L$. To verify the theoretical lower complexity of the\nalgorithm, and to identify regimes for speedup, we test the effectiveness of\nDeepPCR in parallelizing the forward and backward pass in multi-layer\nperceptrons, and reach speedups of up to $30\\times$ for forward and $200\\times$\nfor backward pass. We additionally showcase the flexibility of DeepPCR by\nparallelizing training of ResNets with as many as 1024 layers, and generation\nin diffusion models, enabling up to $7\\times$ faster training and $11\\times$\nfaster generation, respectively, when compared to the sequential approach.",

          "description": "We investigate the regret-minimisation problem in a multi-armed bandit\nsetting with arbitrary corruptions. Similar to the classical setup, the agent\nreceives rewards generated independently from the distribution of the arm\nchosen at each time. However, these rewards are not directly observed. Instead,\nwith a fixed $\\varepsilon\\in (0,\\frac{1}{2})$, the agent observes a sample from\nthe chosen arm's distribution with probability $1-\\varepsilon$, or from an\narbitrary corruption distribution with probability $\\varepsilon$. Importantly,\nwe impose no assumptions on these corruption distributions, which can be\nunbounded. In this setting, accommodating potentially unbounded corruptions, we\nestablish a problem-dependent lower bound on regret for a given family of arm\ndistributions. We introduce CRIMED, an asymptotically-optimal algorithm that\nachieves the exact lower bound on regret for bandits with Gaussian\ndistributions with known variance. Additionally, we provide a finite-sample\nanalysis of CRIMED's regret performance. Notably, CRIMED can effectively handle\ncorruptions with $\\varepsilon$ values as high as $\\frac{1}{2}$. Furthermore, we\ndevelop a tight concentration result for medians in the presence of arbitrary\ncorruptions, even with $\\varepsilon$ values up to $\\frac{1}{2}$, which may be\nof independent interest.

Geodesic regression on the space of 3D discrete surfaces offers a\nprincipled way to characterize the evolution of a brain's shape.

However, its application in certain imaging fields,\nsuch as microscopy and satellite imaging, presents unique challenges.

Furthermore, the model must demonstrate\nrobustness to sparsity in input channels, as they may not be densely available\nduring training or testing. In this paper, we propose a modification to the ViT\narchitecture that enhances reasoning across the input channels and introduce\nHierarchical Channel Sampling (HCS) as an additional regularization technique\nto ensure robustness when only partial channels are presented during test time.\nOur proposed model, ChannelViT, constructs patch tokens independently from each\ninput channel and utilizes a learnable channel embedding that is added to the\npatch tokens, similar to positional embeddings. We evaluate the performance of\nChannelViT on ImageNet, JUMP-CP (microscopy cell imaging), and So2Sat\n(satellite imaging). Our results show that ChannelViT outperforms ViT on\nclassification tasks and generalizes well, even when a subset of input channels\nis used during testing. Across our experiments, HCS proves to be a powerful\nregularizer, independent of the architecture employed, suggesting itself as a\nstraightforward technique for robust ViT training.

          "description": "Quantifying the dependence between high-dimensional random variables is\ncentral to statistical learning and inference. Two classical methods are\ncanonical correlation analysis (CCA), which identifies maximally correlated\nprojected versions of the original variables, and Shannon's mutual information,\nwhich is a universal dependence measure that also captures high-order\ndependencies. However, CCA only accounts for linear dependence, which may be\ninsufficient for certain applications, while mutual information is often\ninfeasible to compute/estimate in high dimensions. This work proposes a middle\nground in the form of a scalable information-theoretic generalization of CCA,\ntermed max-sliced mutual information (mSMI). mSMI equals the maximal mutual\ninformation between low-dimensional projections of the high-dimensional\nvariables, which reduces back to CCA in the Gaussian case. It enjoys the best\nof both worlds: capturing intricate dependencies in the data while being\namenable to fast computation and scalable estimation from samples. We show that\nmSMI retains favorable structural properties of Shannon's mutual information,\nlike variational forms and identification of independence. We then study\nstatistical estimation of mSMI, propose an efficiently computable neural\nestimator, and couple it with formal non-asymptotic error bounds.

This negatively impacts the output of\nthe classifier, leading to improper classification. Furthermore, other factors\nsuch as the overlapping of multiple classes limit the extent of the correctness\nof the output. This work proposes a novel framework for integrating data\npre-processing and dynamic ensemble selection, by formulating the\nclassification framework for the nonstationary drifting imbalanced data stream,\nwhich employs the data pre-processing and dynamic ensemble selection\ntechniques. The proposed framework was evaluated using six artificially\ngenerated data streams with differing imbalance ratios in combination with two\ndifferent types of concept drifts. Each stream is composed of 200 chunks of 500\nobjects described by eight features and contains five concept drifts. Seven\npre-processing techniques and two dynamic ensemble selection methods were\nconsidered. According to experimental results, data pre-processing combined\nwith Dynamic Ensemble Selection techniques significantly delivers more accuracy\nwhen dealing with imbalanced data streams.",

          "description": "High-quality face images are required to guarantee the stability and\nreliability of automatic face recognition (FR) systems in surveillance and\nsecurity scenarios. However, a massive amount of face data is usually\ncompressed before being analyzed due to limitations on transmission or storage.\nThe compressed images may lose the powerful identity information, resulting in\nthe performance degradation of the FR system. Herein, we make the first attempt\nto study just noticeable difference (JND) for the FR system, which can be\ndefined as the maximum distortion that the FR system cannot notice. More\nspecifically, we establish a JND dataset including 3530 original images and\n137,670 compressed images generated by advanced reference encoding/decoding\nsoftware based on the Versatile Video Coding (VVC) standard (VTM-15.0).\nSubsequently, we develop a novel JND prediction model to directly infer JND\nimages for the FR system. In particular, in order to maximum redundancy removal\nwithout impairment of robust identity information, we apply the encoder with\nmultiple feature extraction and attention-based feature decomposition modules\nto progressively decompose face features into two uncorrelated components,\ni.e., identity and residual features, via self-supervised learning. Then, the\nresidual feature is fed into the decoder to generate the residual map. Finally,\nthe predicted JND map is obtained by subtracting the residual map from the\noriginal image. Experimental results have demonstrated that the proposed model\nachieves higher accuracy of JND map prediction compared with the\nstate-of-the-art JND models, and is capable of saving more bits while\nmaintaining the performance of the FR system compared with VTM-15.0.",

We perform numerical simulations of QCNN models with\nvarious sets of quantum convolution and pooling operations for MNIST data\nclassification under transfer learning, in which a classical CNN is trained\nwith Fashion-MNIST data. The results show that transfer learning from classical\nto quantum CNN performs considerably better than purely classical transfer\nlearning models under similar training conditions.",

          "description": "Autonomous systems (AS) often use Deep Neural Network (DNN) classifiers to\nallow them to operate in complex, high-dimensional, non-linear, and dynamically\nchanging environments. Due to the complexity of these environments, DNN\nclassifiers may output misclassifications during operation when they face\ndomains not identified during development. Removing a system from operation for\nretraining becomes impractical as the number of such AS increases. To increase\nAS reliability and overcome this limitation, DNN classifiers need to have the\nability to adapt during operation when faced with different operational domains\nusing a few samples (e.g. 100 samples). However, retraining DNNs on a few\nsamples is known to cause catastrophic forgetting. In this paper, we introduce\nDynamic Incremental Regularised Adaptation (DIRA), a framework for operational\ndomain adaption of DNN classifiers using regularisation techniques to overcome\ncatastrophic forgetting and achieve adaptation when retraining using a few\nsamples of the target domain.

          "description": "Many emerging user-facing services adopt Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to\nimprove serving accuracy. When the graph used by a GNN model changes,\nrepresentations (embedding) of nodes in the graph should be updated\naccordingly. However, the node representation update is too slow, resulting in\neither long response latency of user queries (the inference is performed after\nthe update completes) or high staleness problem (the inference is performed\nbased on stale data). Our in-depth analysis shows that the slow update is\nmainly due to neighbor explosion problem in graphs and duplicated computation.\nBased on such findings, we propose STAG, a GNN serving framework that enables\nlow latency and low staleness of GNN-based services. It comprises a\ncollaborative serving mechanism and an additivity-based incremental propagation\nstrategy. With the collaborative serving mechanism, only part of node\nrepresentations are updated during the update phase, and the final\nrepresentations are calculated in the inference phase. It alleviates the\nneighbor explosion problem. The additivity-based incremental propagation\nstrategy reuses intermediate data during the update phase, eliminating\nduplicated computation problem. Experimental results show that STAG accelerates\nthe update phase by 1.3x~90.1x, and greatly reduces staleness time with a\nslight increase in response latency.",

          "description": "A fundamental shortcoming of the concept of Nash equilibrium is its\ncomputational intractability: approximating Nash equilibria in normal-form\ngames is PPAD-hard. In this paper, inspired by the ideas of smoothed analysis,\nwe introduce a relaxed variant of Nash equilibrium called $\\sigma$-smooth Nash\nequilibrium, for a smoothness parameter $\\sigma$. In a $\\sigma$-smooth Nash\nequilibrium, players only need to achieve utility at least as high as their\nbest deviation to a $\\sigma$-smooth strategy, which is a distribution that does\nnot put too much mass (as parametrized by $\\sigma$) on any fixed action. We\ndistinguish two variants of $\\sigma$-smooth Nash equilibria: strong\n$\\sigma$-smooth Nash equilibria, in which players are required to play\n$\\sigma$-smooth strategies under equilibrium play, and weak $\\sigma$-smooth\nNash equilibria, where there is no such requirement.\n\nWe show that both weak and strong $\\sigma$-smooth Nash equilibria have\nsuperior computational properties to Nash equilibria: when $\\sigma$ as well as\nan approximation parameter $\\epsilon$ and the number of players are all\nconstants, there is a constant-time randomized algorithm to find a weak\n$\\epsilon$-approximate $\\sigma$-smooth Nash equilibrium in normal-form games.\nIn the same parameter regime, there is a polynomial-time deterministic\nalgorithm to find a strong $\\epsilon$-approximate $\\sigma$-smooth Nash\nequilibrium in a normal-form game. These results stand in contrast to the\noptimal algorithm for computing $\\epsilon$-approximate Nash equilibria, which\ncannot run in faster than quasipolynomial-time. We complement our upper bounds\nby showing that when either $\\sigma$ or $\\epsilon$ is an inverse polynomial,\nfinding a weak $\\epsilon$-approximate $\\sigma$-smooth Nash equilibria becomes\ncomputationally intractable.",

The\nconsistency constraint is applied to distill a consistency model from a\nwell-designed diffusion-based teacher model, which ultimately yields superior\nperformances in the distilled CoMoSpeech. Our experiments show that by\ngenerating audio recordings by a single sampling step, the CoMoSpeech achieves\nan inference speed more than 150 times faster than real-time on a single NVIDIA\nA100 GPU, which is comparable to FastSpeech2, making diffusion-sampling based\nspeech synthesis truly practical. Meanwhile, objective and subjective\nevaluations on text-to-speech and singing voice synthesis show that the\nproposed teacher models yield the best audio quality, and the one-step sampling\nbased CoMoSpeech achieves the best inference speed with better or comparable\naudio quality to other conventional multi-step diffusion model baselines.

          "description": "Rapid and accurate identification of Venous thromboembolism (VTE), a severe\ncardiovascular condition including deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary\nembolism (PE), is important for effective treatment. Leveraging Natural\nLanguage Processing (NLP) on radiology reports, automated methods have shown\npromising advancements in identifying VTE events from retrospective data\ncohorts or aiding clinical experts in identifying VTE events from radiology\nreports. However, effectively training Deep Learning (DL) and the NLP models is\nchallenging due to limited labeled medical text data, the complexity and\nheterogeneity of radiology reports, and data imbalance. This study proposes\nnovel method combinations of DL methods, along with data augmentation, adaptive\npre-trained NLP model selection, and a clinical expert NLP rule-based\nclassifier, to improve the accuracy of VTE identification in unstructured\n(free-text) radiology reports. Our experimental results demonstrate the model's\nefficacy, achieving an impressive 97\\% accuracy and 97\\% F1 score in predicting\nDVT, and an outstanding 98.3\\% accuracy and 98.4\\% F1 score in predicting PE.\nThese findings emphasize the model's robustness and its potential to\nsignificantly contribute to VTE research.",

Even though the\nstate-of-the-art models successfully modify the requested attributes, they\nsimultaneously modify other important characteristics of the image, such as a\nperson's identity. In this paper, we focus on solving this problem by\nintroducing PluGeN4Faces, a plugin to StyleGAN, which explicitly disentangles\nface attributes from a person's identity. Our key idea is to perform training\non images retrieved from movie frames, where a given person appears in various\nposes and with different attributes. By applying a type of contrastive loss, we\nencourage the model to group images of the same person in similar regions of\nlatent space. Our experiments demonstrate that the modifications of face\nattributes performed by PluGeN4Faces are significantly less invasive on the\nremaining characteristics of the image than in the existing state-of-the-art\nmodels.",

          "description": "We consider probabilistic models for sequential observations which exhibit\ngradual transitions among a finite number of states. We are particularly\nmotivated by applications such as human activity analysis where observed\naccelerometer time series contains segments representing distinct activities,\nwhich we call pure states, as well as periods characterized by continuous\ntransition among these pure states. To capture this transitory behavior, the\ndynamical Wasserstein barycenter (DWB) model of Cheng et al. in 2021 [1]\nassociates with each pure state a data-generating distribution and models the\ncontinuous transitions among these states as a Wasserstein barycenter of these\ndistributions with dynamically evolving weights. Focusing on the univariate\ncase where Wasserstein distances and barycenters can be computed in closed\nform, we extend [1] specifically relaxing the parameterization of the pure\nstates as Gaussian distributions. We highlight issues related to the uniqueness\nin identifying the model parameters as well as uncertainties induced when\nestimating a dynamically evolving distribution from a limited number of\nsamples. To ameliorate non-uniqueness, we introduce regularization that imposes\ntemporal smoothness on the dynamics of the barycentric weights. A\nquantile-based approximation of the pure state distributions yields a finite\ndimensional estimation problem which we numerically solve using cyclic descent\nalternating between updates to the pure-state quantile functions and the\nbarycentric weights. We demonstrate the utility of the proposed algorithm in\nsegmenting both simulated and real world human activity time series.",

Traditional data-driven\nmethods fall short due to a lack of physical constraints like mass\nconservation; PSMs address this issue by training deep neural networks with\nsensor data and physics-informing using components' Partial Differential\nEquations (PDEs), resulting in a physics-constrained, end-to-end differentiable\nforward dynamics model. Through two in silico experiments - a heated channel\nand a cooling system loop - we demonstrate that PSMs offer a more accurate\napproach than purely data-driven models.\n\nBeyond accuracy, there are several compelling use cases for PSMs. In this\nwork, we showcase two: the creation of a nonlinear supervisory controller\nthrough a sequentially updated state-space representation and the proposal of a\ndiagnostic algorithm using residuals from each of the PDEs. The former\ndemonstrates the ability of PSMs to handle both constant and time-dependent\nconstraints, while the latter illustrates their value in system diagnostics and\nfault detection. We further posit that PSMs could serve as a foundation for\nDigital Twins, constantly updated digital representations of physical systems.",

          "description": "This study introduces a novel hierarchical divisive clustering approach with\nstochastic splitting functions (SSFs) to enhance classification performance in\nmulti-class datasets through hierarchical classification (HC). The method has\nthe unique capability of generating hierarchy without requiring explicit\ninformation, making it suitable for datasets lacking prior knowledge of\nhierarchy. By systematically dividing classes into two subsets based on their\ndiscriminability according to the classifier, the proposed approach constructs\na binary tree representation of hierarchical classes. The approach is evaluated\non 46 multi-class time series datasets using popular classifiers (svm and\nrocket) and SSFs (potr, srtr, and lsoo). The results reveal that the approach\nsignificantly improves classification performance in approximately half and a\nthird of the datasets when using rocket and svm as the classifier,\nrespectively. The study also explores the relationship between dataset features\nand HC performance. While the number of classes and flat classification (FC)\nscore show consistent significance, variations are observed with different\nsplitting functions. Overall, the proposed approach presents a promising\nstrategy for enhancing classification by generating hierarchical structure in\nmulti-class time series datasets. Future research directions involve exploring\ndifferent splitting functions, classifiers, and hierarchy structures, as well\nas applying the approach to diverse domains beyond time series data.

          "description": "Analyzing high resolution whole slide images (WSIs) with regard to\ninformation across multiple scales poses a significant challenge in digital\npathology. Multi-instance learning (MIL) is a common solution for working with\nhigh resolution images by classifying bags of objects (i.e. sets of smaller\nimage patches). However, such processing is typically performed at a single\nscale (e.g., 20x magnification) of WSIs, disregarding the vital inter-scale\ninformation that is key to diagnoses by human pathologists. In this study, we\npropose a novel cross-scale MIL algorithm to explicitly aggregate inter-scale\nrelationships into a single MIL network for pathological image diagnosis. The\ncontribution of this paper is three-fold: (1) A novel cross-scale MIL (CS-MIL)\nalgorithm that integrates the multi-scale information and the inter-scale\nrelationships is proposed; (2) A toy dataset with scale-specific morphological\nfeatures is created and released to examine and visualize differential\ncross-scale attention; (3) Superior performance on both in-house and public\ndatasets is demonstrated by our simple cross-scale MIL strategy. The official\nimplementation is publicly available at https://github.com/hrlblab/CS-MIL.",

          "description": "Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), a widely used optimization algorithm in\ndeep learning, is often limited to converging to local optima due to the\nnon-convex nature of the problem. Leveraging these local optima to improve\nmodel performance remains a challenging task. Given the inherent complexity of\nneural networks, the simple arithmetic averaging of the obtained local optima\nmodels in undesirable results. This paper proposes a {\\em soft merging} method\nthat facilitates rapid merging of multiple models, simplifies the merging of\nspecific parts of neural networks, and enhances robustness against malicious\nmodels with extreme values. This is achieved by learning gate parameters\nthrough a surrogate of the $l_0$ norm using hard concrete distribution without\nmodifying the model weights of the given local optima models. This merging\nprocess not only enhances the model performance by converging to a better local\noptimum, but also minimizes computational costs, offering an efficient and\nexplicit learning process integrated with stochastic gradient descent. Thorough\nexperiments underscore the effectiveness and superior performance of the merged\nneural networks.",

          "description": "Biomedical image datasets can be imbalanced due to the rarity of targeted\ndiseases. Generative Adversarial Networks play a key role in addressing this\nimbalance by enabling the generation of synthetic images to augment datasets.\nIt is important to generate synthetic images that incorporate a diverse range\nof features to accurately represent the distribution of features present in the\ntraining imagery. Furthermore, the absence of diverse features in synthetic\nimages can degrade the performance of machine learning classifiers. The mode\ncollapse problem impacts Generative Adversarial Networks' capacity to generate\ndiversified images. Mode collapse comes in two varieties: intra-class and\ninter-class. In this paper, both varieties of the mode collapse problem are\ninvestigated, and their subsequent impact on the diversity of synthetic X-ray\nimages is evaluated. This work contributes an empirical demonstration of the\nbenefits of integrating the adaptive input-image normalization with the Deep\nConvolutional GAN and Auxiliary Classifier GAN to alleviate the mode collapse\nproblems. Synthetically generated images are utilized for data augmentation and\ntraining a Vision Transformer model. The classification performance of the\nmodel is evaluated using accuracy, recall, and precision scores. Results\ndemonstrate that the DCGAN and the ACGAN with adaptive input-image\nnormalization outperform the DCGAN and ACGAN with un-normalized X-ray images as\nevidenced by the superior diversity scores and classification scores.",

Participants were provided with two types of datasets for each\ntask: expert and mixed datasets with varying skill levels. While the simplest\noffline policy learning algorithm, Behavioral Cloning (BC), performed\nremarkably well when trained on expert datasets, it outperformed even the most\nadvanced offline reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms. However, BC's\nperformance deteriorated when applied to mixed datasets, and the performance of\noffline RL algorithms was also unsatisfactory. Upon examining the mixed\ndatasets, we observed that they contained a significant amount of expert data,\nalthough this data was unlabeled. To address this issue, we proposed a\nsemi-supervised learning-based classifier to identify the underlying expert\nbehavior within mixed datasets, effectively isolating the expert data. To\nfurther enhance BC's performance, we leveraged the geometric symmetry of the\nRRC arena to augment the training dataset through mathematical transformations.\nIn the end, our submission surpassed that of all other participants, even those\nwho employed complex offline RL algorithms and intricate data processing and\nfeature engineering techniques.",

          "description": "Numerically solving partial differential equations typically requires fine\ndiscretization to resolve necessary spatiotemporal scales, which can be\ncomputationally expensive. Recent advances in deep learning have provided a new\napproach to solving partial differential equations that involves the use of\nneural operators. Neural operators are neural network architectures that learn\nmappings between function spaces and have the capability to solve partial\ndifferential equations based on data. This study utilizes a novel neural\noperator called Hyena, which employs a long convolutional filter that is\nparameterized by a multilayer perceptron. The Hyena operator is an operation\nthat enjoys sub-quadratic complexity and state space model to parameterize long\nconvolution that enjoys a global receptive field. This mechanism enhances the\nmodel's comprehension of the input's context and enables data-dependent weight\nfor different partial differential equations instances. To measure how\neffective the layers are in solving partial differential equations, we conduct\nexperiments on Diffusion-Reaction equation and Navier Stokes equation. Our\nfindings indicate Hyena Neural operator can serve as an efficient and accurate\nmodel for learning partial differential equations solution operator.

However, adversaries can still infer\nindividual information through inference attacks (e.g. differential attacks) on\nthese training parameters. As a result, Differential Privacy (DP) has been\nwidely used in FL to prevent such attacks. We consider differentially private\nfederated learning in a resource-constrained scenario, where both privacy\nbudget and communication round are constrained. By theoretically analyzing the\nconvergence, we can find the optimal number of differentially private local\niterations for clients between any two sequential global updates. Based on\nthis, we design an algorithm of differentially private federated learning with\nadaptive local iterations (ALI-DPFL).

          "description": "Learning control policies offline from pre-recorded datasets is a promising\navenue for solving challenging real-world problems. However, available datasets\nare typically of mixed quality, with a limited number of the trajectories that\nwe would consider as positive examples; i.e., high-quality demonstrations.\nTherefore, we propose a novel iterative learning algorithm for identifying\nexpert trajectories in unlabeled mixed-quality robotics datasets given a\nminimal set of positive examples, surpassing existing algorithms in terms of\naccuracy. We show that applying behavioral cloning to the resulting filtered\ndataset outperforms several competitive offline reinforcement learning and\nimitation learning baselines.

          "description": "Connectionist temporal classification (CTC) is commonly adopted for sequence\nmodeling tasks like speech recognition, where it is necessary to preserve order\nbetween the input and target sequences. However, CTC is only applied to\ndeterministic sequence models, where the latent space is discontinuous and\nsparse, which in turn makes them less capable of handling data variability when\ncompared to variational models. In this paper, we integrate CTC with a\nvariational model and derive loss functions that can be used to train more\ngeneralizable sequence models that preserve order. Specifically, we derive two\nversions of the novel variational CTC based on two reasonable assumptions, the\nfirst being that the variational latent variables at each time step are\nconditionally independent; and the second being that these latent variables are\nMarkovian. We show that both loss functions allow direct optimization of the\nvariational lower bound for the model log-likelihood, and present\ncomputationally tractable forms for implementing them.",

          "description": "The ability to classify images is dependent on having access to large labeled\ndatasets and testing on data from the same domain that the model can train on.\nClassification becomes more challenging when dealing with new data from a\ndifferent domain, where gathering and especially labeling a larger image\ndataset for retraining a classification model requires a labor-intensive human\neffort. Cross-domain classification frameworks were developed to handle this\ndata domain shift problem by utilizing unsupervised image-to-image translation\nmodels to translate an input image from the unlabeled domain to the labeled\ndomain. The problem with these unsupervised models lies in their unsupervised\nnature. For lack of annotations, it is not possible to use the traditional\nsupervised metrics to evaluate these translation models to pick the best-saved\ncheckpoint model. This paper introduces a new method called Domain-knowledge\nInspired Pseudo Supervision (DIPS) which utilizes domain-informed Gaussian\nMixture Models to generate pseudo annotations to enable the use of traditional\nsupervised metrics. This method was designed specifically to support\ncross-domain classification applications contrary to other typically used\nmetrics such as the FID which were designed to evaluate the model in terms of\nthe quality of the generated image from a human-eye perspective. DIPS proves\nits effectiveness by outperforming various GAN evaluation metrics, including\nFID, when selecting the optimal saved checkpoint model. It is also evaluated\nagainst truly supervised metrics. Furthermore, DIPS showcases its robustness\nand interpretability by demonstrating a strong correlation with truly\nsupervised metrics, highlighting its superiority over existing state-of-the-art\nalternatives.

          "description": "Emerging real-time multi-model ML (RTMM) workloads such as AR/VR and drone\ncontrol involve dynamic behaviors in various granularity; task, model, and\nlayers within a model. Such dynamic behaviors introduce new challenges to the\nsystem software in an ML system since the overall system load is not completely\npredictable, unlike traditional ML workloads. In addition, RTMM workloads\nrequire real-time processing, involve highly heterogeneous models, and target\nresource-constrained devices. Under such circumstances, developing an effective\nscheduler gains more importance to better utilize underlying hardware\nconsidering the unique characteristics of RTMM workloads. Therefore, we propose\na new scheduler, DREAM, which effectively handles various dynamicity in RTMM\nworkloads targeting multi-accelerator systems. DREAM quantifies the unique\nrequirements for RTMM workloads and utilizes the quantified scores to drive\nscheduling decisions, considering the current system load and other inference\njobs on different models and input frames. DREAM utilizes tunable parameters\nthat provide fast and effective adaptivity to dynamic workload changes. In our\nevaluation of five scenarios of RTMM workload, DREAM reduces the overall\nUXCost, which is an equivalent metric of the energy-delay product (EDP) for\nRTMM defined in the paper, by 32.2% and 50.0% in the geometric mean (up to\n80.8% and 97.6%) compared to state-of-the-art baselines, which shows the\nefficacy of our scheduling methodology.",

Diffractive optical networks provide a promising solution for\nimplementing artificial intelligence with high-speed and low-power consumption.\nMost of the reported diffractive optical networks focus on single or multiple\ntasks that do not involve environmental interaction, such as object recognition\nand image classification. In contrast, the networks capable of performing\ndecision-making and control have not yet been developed to our knowledge. Here,\nwe propose using deep reinforcement learning to implement diffractive optical\nnetworks that imitate human-level decision-making and control capability. Such\nnetworks taking advantage of a residual architecture, allow for finding optimal\ncontrol policies through interaction with the environment and can be readily\nimplemented with existing optical devices. The superior performance of these\nnetworks is verified by engaging three types of classic games, Tic-Tac-Toe,\nSuper Mario Bros., and Car Racing. Finally, we present an experimental\ndemonstration of playing Tic-Tac-Toe by leveraging diffractive optical networks\nbased on a spatial light modulator.

A natural problem then is to\nanalyse and compare the (not necessarily hierarchical) sequences of partitions\nthat underpin such multiscale descriptions of data. Here, we introduce a\nfiltration of abstract simplicial complexes, denoted the Multiscale Clustering\nFiltration (MCF), which encodes arbitrary patterns of cluster assignments\nacross scales, and we prove that the MCF produces stable persistence diagrams.\nWe then show that the zero-dimensional persistent homology of the MCF measures\nthe degree of hierarchy in the sequence of partitions, and that the\nhigher-dimensional persistent homology tracks the emergence and resolution of\nconflicts between cluster assignments across the sequence of partitions. To\nbroaden the theoretical foundations of the MCF, we also provide an equivalent\nconstruction via a nerve complex filtration, and we show that in the\nhierarchical case, the MCF reduces to a Vietoris-Rips filtration of an\nultrametric space.

          "description": "We tackle the problem of robust novelty detection, where we aim to detect\nnovelties in terms of semantic content while being invariant to changes in\nother, irrelevant factors. Specifically, we operate in a setup with multiple\nenvironments, where we determine the set of features that are associated more\nwith the environments, rather than to the content relevant for the task. Thus,\nwe propose a method that starts with a pretrained embedding and a multi-env\nsetup and manages to rank the features based on their environment-focus. First,\nwe compute a per-feature score based on the feature distribution variance\nbetween envs. Next, we show that by dropping the highly scored ones, we manage\nto remove spurious correlations and improve the overall performance by up to\n6%, both in covariance and sub-population shift cases, both for a real and a\nsynthetic benchmark, that we introduce for this task.",

          "description": "With growing attention to tabular data these days, the attempt to apply a\nsynthetic table to various tasks has been expanded toward various scenarios.\nOwing to the recent advances in generative modeling, fake data generated by\ntabular data synthesis models become sophisticated and realistic. However,\nthere still exists a difficulty in modeling discrete variables (columns) of\ntabular data. In this work, we propose to process continuous and discrete\nvariables separately (but being conditioned on each other) by two diffusion\nmodels. The two diffusion models are co-evolved during training by reading\nconditions from each other. In order to further bind the diffusion models,\nmoreover, we introduce a contrastive learning method with a negative sampling\nmethod.

          "description": "Modern deep networks are trained with stochastic gradient descent (SGD) whose\nkey parameters are the number of data considered at each step or batch size\n$B$, and the step size or learning rate $\\eta$. For small $B$ and large $\\eta$,\nSGD corresponds to a stochastic evolution of the parameters, whose noise\namplitude is governed by the `temperature' $T\\equiv \\eta/B$. Yet this\ndescription is observed to break down for sufficiently large batches $B\\geq\nB^*$, or simplifies to gradient descent (GD) when the temperature is\nsufficiently small. Understanding where these cross-overs take place remains a\ncentral challenge. Here we resolve these questions for a teacher-student\nperceptron classification model, and show empirically that our key predictions\nstill apply to deep networks. Specifically, we obtain a phase diagram in the\n$B$-$\\eta$ plane that separates three dynamical phases: $\\textit{(i)}$ a\nnoise-dominated SGD governed by temperature, $\\textit{(ii)}$ a\nlarge-first-step-dominated SGD and $\\textit{(iii)}$ GD. These different phases\nalso corresponds to different regimes of generalization error. Remarkably, our\nanalysis reveals that the batch size $B^*$ separating regimes $\\textit{(i)}$\nand $\\textit{(ii)}$ scale with the size $P$ of the training set, with an\nexponent that characterizes the hardness of the classification problem.",

          "description": "A variety of different performance metrics are commonly used in the machine\nlearning literature for the evaluation of classification systems. Some of the\nmost common ones for measuring quality of hard decisions are standard and\nbalanced accuracy, standard and balanced error rate, F-beta score, and Matthews\ncorrelation coefficient (MCC). In this document, we review the definition of\nthese and other metrics and compare them with the expected cost (EC), a metric\nintroduced in every statistical learning course but rarely used in the machine\nlearning literature. We show that both the standard and balanced error rates\nare special cases of the EC. Further, we show its relation with F-beta score\nand MCC and argue that EC is superior to these traditional metrics for being\nbased on first principles from statistics, and for being more general,\ninterpretable, and adaptable to any application scenario. The metrics mentioned\nabove measure the quality of hard decisions. Yet, most modern classification\nsystems output continuous scores for the classes which we may want to evaluate\ndirectly. Metrics for measuring the quality of system scores include the area\nunder the ROC curve, equal error rate, cross-entropy, Brier score, and Bayes EC\nor Bayes risk, among others. The last three metrics are special cases of a\nfamily of metrics given by the expected value of proper scoring rules (PSRs).\nWe review the theory behind these metrics, showing that they are a principled\nway to measure the quality of the posterior probabilities produced by a system.\nFinally, we show how to use these metrics to compute a system's calibration\nloss and compare this metric with the widely-used expected calibration error\n(ECE), arguing that calibration loss based on PSRs is superior to the ECE for\nbeing more interpretable, more general, and directly applicable to the\nmulti-class case, among other reasons.",

The central challenge is the\nsubstantial learning gap between seen and novel categories, as the model learns\nthe former faster due to accurate supervisory information. To address this, we\nintroduce 1) an adaptive margin loss based on estimated class distribution,\nwhich encourages a large negative margin for samples in seen classes, to\nsynchronize learning paces, and 2) pseudo-label contrastive clustering, which\npulls together samples which are likely from the same class in the output\nspace, to enhance novel class discovery. Our extensive evaluations on multiple\ndatasets demonstrate that existing models still hinder novel class learning,\nwhereas our approach strikingly balances both seen and novel classes, achieving\na remarkable 3% average accuracy increase on the ImageNet dataset compared to\nthe prior state-of-the-art.

This paper introduces two\ndeterministic approximation algorithms for the problem that competitively\nimprove the query complexity of existing algorithms.\n\nOur first algorithm, $\\LAA$, returns an approximation ratio of $1/19$ within\n$O(nk)$ query complexity. The second one, $\\RLA$, improves the approximation\nratio to $1/5-\\epsilon$ in $O(nk)$ queries, where $\\epsilon$ is an input\nparameter.\n\nOur algorithms are the first ones that provide constant approximation ratios\nwithin only $O(nk)$ query complexity for the non-monotone objective. They,\ntherefore, need fewer the number of queries than state-of-the-the-art ones by a\nfactor of $\\Omega(\\log n)$.\n\nBesides the theoretical analysis, we have evaluated our proposed ones with\nseveral experiments in some instances: Influence Maximization and Sensor\nPlacement for the problem.

          "description": "Disease progression simulation is a crucial area of research that has\nsignificant implications for clinical diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment. One\nmajor challenge in this field is the lack of continuous medical imaging\nmonitoring of individual patients over time. To address this issue, we develop\na novel framework termed Progressive Image Editing (PIE) that enables\ncontrolled manipulation of disease-related image features, facilitating precise\nand realistic disease progression simulation. Specifically, we leverage recent\nadvancements in text-to-image generative models to simulate disease progression\naccurately and personalize it for each patient. We theoretically analyze the\niterative refining process in our framework as a gradient descent with an\nexponentially decayed learning rate. To validate our framework, we conduct\nexperiments in three medical imaging domains. Our results demonstrate the\nsuperiority of PIE over existing methods such as Stable Diffusion Walk and\nStyle-Based Manifold Extrapolation based on CLIP score (Realism) and Disease\nClassification Confidence (Alignment). Our user study collected feedback from\n35 veteran physicians to assess the generated progressions. Remarkably, 76.2%\nof the feedback agrees with the fidelity of the generated progressions. To our\nbest knowledge, PIE is the first of its kind to generate disease progression\nimages meeting real-world standards.

          "description": "Adiabatic Quantum-Flux-Parametron (AQFP) is a superconducting logic with\nextremely high energy efficiency. By employing the distinct polarity of current\nto denote logic `0' and `1', AQFP devices serve as excellent carriers for\nbinary neural network (BNN) computations. Although recent research has made\ninitial strides toward developing an AQFP-based BNN accelerator, several\ncritical challenges remain, preventing the design from being a comprehensive\nsolution. In this paper, we propose SupeRBNN, an AQFP-based randomized BNN\nacceleration framework that leverages software-hardware co-optimization to\neventually make the AQFP devices a feasible solution for BNN acceleration.\nSpecifically, we investigate the randomized behavior of the AQFP devices and\nanalyze the impact of crossbar size on current attenuation, subsequently\nformulating the current amplitude into the values suitable for use in BNN\ncomputation. To tackle the accumulation problem and improve overall hardware\nperformance, we propose a stochastic computing-based accumulation module and a\nclocking scheme adjustment-based circuit optimization method. We validate our\nSupeRBNN framework across various datasets and network architectures, comparing\nit with implementations based on different technologies, including CMOS, ReRAM,\nand superconducting RSFQ/ERSFQ. Experimental results demonstrate that our\ndesign achieves an energy efficiency of approximately 7.8x10^4 times higher\nthan that of the ReRAM-based BNN framework while maintaining a similar level of\nmodel accuracy. Furthermore, when compared with superconductor-based\ncounterparts, our framework demonstrates at least two orders of magnitude\nhigher energy efficiency.",

BTLM-3B-8K was\ntrained on 627B tokens from the SlimPajama dataset with a mixture of 2,048 and\n8,192 context lengths. BTLM-3B-8K outperforms all existing 3B parameter models\nby 2-5.5% across downstream tasks. BTLM-3B-8K is even competitive with some 7B\nparameter models. Additionally, BTLM-3B-8K provides excellent long context\nperformance, outperforming MPT-7B-8K and XGen-7B-8K on tasks up to 8,192\ncontext length. We trained the model on a cleaned and deduplicated SlimPajama\ndataset; aggressively tuned the \\textmu P hyperparameters and schedule; used\nALiBi position embeddings; and adopted the SwiGLU nonlinearity.\n\nOn Hugging Face, the most popular models have 7B parameters, indicating that\nusers prefer the quality-size ratio of 7B models. Compacting the 7B parameter\nmodel to one with 3B parameters, with little performance impact, is an\nimportant milestone. BTLM-3B-8K needs only 3GB of memory with 4-bit precision\nand takes 2.5x less inference compute than 7B models, helping to open up access\nto a powerful language model on mobile and edge devices.

          "description": "A common formulation of constrained reinforcement learning involves multiple\nrewards that must individually accumulate to given thresholds. In this class of\nproblems, we show a simple example in which the desired optimal policy cannot\nbe induced by any weighted linear combination of rewards. Hence, there exist\nconstrained reinforcement learning problems for which neither regularized nor\nclassical primal-dual methods yield optimal policies. This work addresses this\nshortcoming by augmenting the state with Lagrange multipliers and\nreinterpreting primal-dual methods as the portion of the dynamics that drives\nthe multipliers evolution. This approach provides a systematic state\naugmentation procedure that is guaranteed to solve reinforcement learning\nproblems with constraints. Thus, as we illustrate by an example, while previous\nmethods can fail at finding optimal policies, running the dual dynamics while\nexecuting the augmented policy yields an algorithm that provably samples\nactions from the optimal policy.",

In the Offline Nanosatellite Task\nScheduling (ONTS) problem, the goal is to find the optimal schedule for tasks\nto be carried out in orbit while taking into account Quality-of-Service (QoS)\nconsiderations such as priority, minimum and maximum activation events,\nexecution time-frames, periods, and execution windows, as well as constraints\non the satellite's power resources and the complexity of energy harvesting and\nmanagement. The ONTS problem has been approached using conventional\nmathematical formulations and exact methods, but their applicability to\nchallenging cases of the problem is limited. This study examines the use of\nGNNs in this context, which has been effectively applied to optimization\nproblems such as the traveling salesman, scheduling, and facility placement\nproblems. More specifically, we investigate whether GNNs can learn the complex\nstructure of the ONTS problem with respect to feasibility and optimality of\ncandidate solutions. Furthermore, we evaluate using GNN-based heuristic\nsolutions to provide better solutions (w.r.t. the objective value) to the ONTS\nproblem and reduce the optimization cost. Our experiments show that GNNs are\nnot only able to learn feasibility and optimality for instances of the ONTS\nproblem, but they can generalize to harder instances than those seen during\ntraining. Furthermore, the GNN-based heuristics improved the expected objective\nvalue of the best solution found under the time limit in 45%, and reduced the\nexpected time to find a feasible solution in 35%, when compared to the SCIP\n(Solving Constraint Integer Programs) solver in its off-the-shelf configuration",

          "description": "Presentation attack (spoofing) detection (PAD) typically operates alongside\nbiometric verification to improve reliablity in the face of spoofing attacks.\nEven though the two sub-systems operate in tandem to solve the single task of\nreliable biometric verification, they address different detection tasks and are\nhence typically evaluated separately. Evidence shows that this approach is\nsuboptimal. We introduce a new metric for the joint evaluation of PAD solutions\noperating in situ with biometric verification. In contrast to the tandem\ndetection cost function proposed recently, the new tandem equal error rate\n(t-EER) is parameter free. The combination of two classifiers nonetheless leads\nto a \\emph{set} of operating points at which false alarm and miss rates are\nequal and also dependent upon the prevalence of attacks. We therefore introduce\nthe \\emph{concurrent} t-EER, a unique operating point which is invariable to\nthe prevalence of attacks. Using both modality (and even application) agnostic\nsimulated scores, as well as real scores for a voice biometrics application, we\ndemonstrate application of the t-EER to a wide range of biometric system\nevaluations under attack. The proposed approach is a strong candidate metric\nfor the tandem evaluation of PAD systems and biometric comparators.",

Given a single RGBD\nimage combined with a text prompt, ForceSight determines a target end-effector\npose in the camera frame (kinematic goal) and the associated forces (force\ngoal). Together, these two components form a visual-force goal. Prior work has\ndemonstrated that deep models outputting human-interpretable kinematic goals\ncan enable dexterous manipulation by real robots. Forces are critical to\nmanipulation, yet have typically been relegated to lower-level execution in\nthese systems.

In a separate experiment, relying exclusively on visual servoing\nand ignoring force goals dropped the success rate from 90% to 45%,\ndemonstrating that force goals can significantly enhance performance.

          "description": "Objective: The objective of the study is to efficiently increase the\nexpressivity of surface electromyography-based (sEMG) gesture recognition\nsystems. Approach: We use a problem transformation approach, in which actions\nwere subset into two biomechanically independent components - a set of wrist\ndirections and a set of finger modifiers. To maintain fast calibration time, we\ntrain models for each component using only individual gestures, and extrapolate\nto the full product space of combination gestures by generating synthetic data.\nWe collected a supervised dataset with high-confidence ground truth labels in\nwhich subjects performed combination gestures while holding a joystick, and\nconducted experiments to analyze the impact of model architectures, classifier\nalgorithms, and synthetic data generation strategies on the performance of the\nproposed approach. Main Results: We found that a problem transformation\napproach using a parallel model architecture in combination with a non-linear\nclassifier, along with restricted synthetic data generation, shows promise in\nincreasing the expressivity of sEMG-based gestures with a short calibration\ntime. Significance: sEMG-based gesture recognition has applications in\nhuman-computer interaction, virtual reality, and the control of robotic and\nprosthetic devices. Existing approaches require exhaustive model calibration.\nThe proposed approach increases expressivity without requiring users to\ndemonstrate all combination gesture classes.

          "description": "We present LongLoRA, an efficient fine-tuning approach that extends the\ncontext sizes of pre-trained large language models (LLMs), with limited\ncomputation cost. Typically, training LLMs with long context sizes is\ncomputationally expensive, requiring extensive training hours and GPU\nresources. For example, training on the context length of 8192 needs 16x\ncomputational costs in self-attention layers as that of 2048. In this paper, we\nspeed up the context extension of LLMs in two aspects. On the one hand,\nalthough dense global attention is needed during inference, fine-tuning the\nmodel can be effectively and efficiently done by sparse local attention. The\nproposed shift short attention effectively enables context extension, leading\nto non-trivial computation saving with similar performance to fine-tuning with\nvanilla attention. Particularly, it can be implemented with only two lines of\ncode in training, while being optional in inference. On the other hand, we\nrevisit the parameter-efficient fine-tuning regime for context expansion.\nNotably, we find that LoRA for context extension works well under the premise\nof trainable embedding and normalization. LongLoRA demonstrates strong\nempirical results on various tasks on LLaMA2 models from 7B/13B to 70B.\nLongLoRA adopts LLaMA2 7B from 4k context to 100k, or LLaMA2 70B to 32k on a\nsingle 8x A100 machine. LongLoRA extends models' context while retaining their\noriginal architectures, and is compatible with most existing techniques, like\nFlashAttention-2.

Semantic-aware transmission scheduling\nof a large system often involves a large decision-making space, and the optimal\npolicy cannot be obtained by existing algorithms effectively. In this paper, we\nfirst investigate the fundamental properties of the optimal semantic-aware\nscheduling policy and then develop advanced deep reinforcement learning (DRL)\nalgorithms by leveraging the theoretical guidelines.

          "description": "Autistic Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a neurological disease characterized by\ndifficulties with social interaction, communication, and repetitive activities.\nThe severity of these difficulties varies, and those with this diagnosis face\nunique challenges. While its primary origin lies in genetics, identifying and\naddressing it early can contribute to the enhancement of the condition. In\nrecent years, machine learning-driven intelligent diagnosis has emerged as a\nsupplement to conventional clinical approaches, aiming to address the potential\ndrawbacks of time-consuming and costly traditional methods. In this work, we\nutilize different machine learning algorithms to find the most significant\ntraits responsible for ASD and to automate the diagnostic process. We study six\nclassification models to see which model works best to identify ASD and also\nstudy five popular clustering methods to get a meaningful insight of these ASD\ndatasets. To find the best classifier for these binary datasets, we evaluate\nthe models using accuracy, precision, recall, specificity, F1-score, AUC, kappa\nand log loss metrics. Our evaluation demonstrates that five out of the six\nselected models perform exceptionally, achieving a 100% accuracy rate on the\nASD datasets when hyperparameters are meticulously tuned for each model. As\nalmost all classification models are able to get 100% accuracy, we become\ninterested in observing the underlying insights of the datasets by implementing\nsome popular clustering algorithms on these datasets. We calculate Normalized\nMutual Information (NMI), Adjusted Rand Index (ARI) & Silhouette Coefficient\n(SC) metrics to select the best clustering models.

          "description": "This paper studies the problem of traffic flow forecasting, which aims to\npredict future traffic conditions on the basis of road networks and traffic\nconditions in the past. The problem is typically solved by modeling complex\nspatio-temporal correlations in traffic data using spatio-temporal graph neural\nnetworks (GNNs). However, the performance of these methods is still far from\nsatisfactory since GNNs usually have limited representation capacity when it\ncomes to complex traffic networks. Graphs, by nature, fall short in capturing\nnon-pairwise relations. Even worse, existing methods follow the paradigm of\nmessage passing that aggregates neighborhood information linearly, which fails\nto capture complicated spatio-temporal high-order interactions. To tackle these\nissues, in this paper, we propose a novel model named Dynamic Hypergraph\nStructure Learning (DyHSL) for traffic flow prediction. To learn non-pairwise\nrelationships, our DyHSL extracts hypergraph structural information to model\ndynamics in the traffic networks, and updates each node representation by\naggregating messages from its associated hyperedges. Additionally, to capture\nhigh-order spatio-temporal relations in the road network, we introduce an\ninteractive graph convolution block, which further models the neighborhood\ninteraction for each node. Finally, we integrate these two views into a\nholistic multi-scale correlation extraction module, which conducts temporal\npooling with different scales to model different temporal patterns. Extensive\nexperiments on four popular traffic benchmark datasets demonstrate the\neffectiveness of our proposed DyHSL compared with a broad range of competing\nbaselines.",

One of the\nfundamental approaches toward this task is to learn a cross-modal embedding\nspace via deep neural networks that is able to connect short snippets of audio\nand sheet music. However, the scarcity of annotated data from real musical\ncontent affects the capability of such methods to generalize to real retrieval\nscenarios. In this work, we investigate whether we can mitigate this limitation\nwith self-supervised contrastive learning, by exposing a network to a large\namount of real music data as a pre-training step, by contrasting randomly\naugmented views of snippets of both modalities, namely audio and sheet images.\nThrough a number of experiments on synthetic and real piano data, we show that\npre-trained models are able to retrieve snippets with better precision in all\nscenarios and pre-training configurations. Encouraged by these results, we\nemploy the snippet embeddings in the higher-level task of cross-modal piece\nidentification and conduct more experiments on several retrieval\nconfigurations. In this task, we observe that the retrieval quality improves\nfrom 30% up to 100% when real music data is present. We then conclude by\narguing for the potential of self-supervised contrastive learning for\nalleviating the annotated data scarcity in multi-modal music retrieval models.",

          "description": "Audiovisual data is everywhere in this digital age, which raises higher\nrequirements for the deep learning models developed on them. To well handle the\ninformation of the multi-modal data is the key to a better audiovisual modal.\nWe observe that these audiovisual data naturally have temporal attributes, such\nas the time information for each frame in the video. More concretely, such data\nis inherently multi-modal according to both audio and visual cues, which\nproceed in a strict chronological order. It indicates that temporal information\nis important in multi-modal acoustic event modeling for both intra- and\ninter-modal. However, existing methods deal with each modal feature\nindependently and simply fuse them together, which neglects the mining of\ntemporal relation and thus leads to sub-optimal performance. With this\nmotivation, we propose a Temporal Multi-modal graph learning method for\nAcoustic event Classification, called TMac, by modeling such temporal\ninformation via graph learning techniques. In particular, we construct a\ntemporal graph for each acoustic event, dividing its audio data and video data\ninto multiple segments. Each segment can be considered as a node, and the\ntemporal relationships between nodes can be considered as timestamps on their\nedges. In this case, we can smoothly capture the dynamic information in\nintra-modal and inter-modal. Several experiments are conducted to demonstrate\nTMac outperforms other SOTA models in performance.

          "description": "Human drivers can seamlessly adapt their driving decisions across\ngeographical locations with diverse conditions and rules of the road, e.g.,\nleft vs. right-hand traffic. In contrast, existing models for autonomous\ndriving have been thus far only deployed within restricted operational domains,\ni.e., without accounting for varying driving behaviors across locations or\nmodel scalability. In this work, we propose AnyD, a single geographically-aware\nconditional imitation learning (CIL) model that can efficiently learn from\nheterogeneous and globally distributed data with dynamic environmental,\ntraffic, and social characteristics. Our key insight is to introduce a\nhigh-capacity geo-location-based channel attention mechanism that effectively\nadapts to local nuances while also flexibly modeling similarities among regions\nin a data-driven manner. By optimizing a contrastive imitation objective, our\nproposed approach can efficiently scale across inherently imbalanced data\ndistributions and location-dependent events. We demonstrate the benefits of our\nAnyD agent across multiple datasets, cities, and scalable deployment paradigms,\ni.e., centralized, semi-supervised, and distributed agent training.\nSpecifically, AnyD outperforms CIL baselines by over 14% in open-loop\nevaluation and 30% in closed-loop testing on CARLA.",

          "description": "Deep learning's immense capabilities are often constrained by the complexity\nof its models, leading to an increasing demand for effective sparsification\ntechniques. Bayesian sparsification for deep learning emerges as a crucial\napproach, facilitating the design of models that are both computationally\nefficient and competitive in terms of performance across various deep learning\napplications. The state-of-the-art -- in Bayesian sparsification of deep neural\nnetworks -- combines structural shrinkage priors on model weights with an\napproximate inference scheme based on black-box stochastic variational\ninference. However, model inversion of the full generative model is\nexceptionally computationally demanding, especially when compared to standard\ndeep learning of point estimates. In this context, we advocate for the use of\nBayesian model reduction (BMR) as a more efficient alternative for pruning of\nmodel weights. As a generalization of the Savage-Dickey ratio, BMR allows a\npost-hoc elimination of redundant model weights based on the posterior\nestimates under a straightforward (non-hierarchical) generative model. Our\ncomparative study highlights the computational efficiency and the pruning rate\nof the BMR method relative to the established stochastic variational inference\n(SVI) scheme, when applied to the full hierarchical generative model. We\nillustrate the potential of BMR to prune model parameters across various deep\nlearning architectures, from classical networks like LeNet to modern frameworks\nsuch as Vision Transformers and MLP-Mixers.",

          "description": "Surrogate-assisted evolutionary algorithms (SAEAs) hold significant\nimportance in resolving expensive optimization problems~(EOPs). Extensive\nefforts have been devoted to improving the efficacy of SAEAs through the\ndevelopment of proficient model-assisted selection methods. However, generating\nhigh-quality solutions is a prerequisite for selection. The fundamental\nparadigm of evaluating a limited number of solutions in each generation within\nSAEAs reduces the variance of adjacent populations, thus impacting the quality\nof offspring solutions. This is a frequently encountered issue, yet it has not\ngained widespread attention. This paper presents a framework using unevaluated\nsolutions to enhance the efficiency of SAEAs. The surrogate model is employed\nto identify high-quality solutions for direct generation of new solutions\nwithout evaluation. To ensure dependable selection, we have introduced two\ntailored relation models for the selection of the optimal solution and the\nunevaluated population. A comprehensive experimental analysis is performed on\ntwo test suites, which showcases the superiority of the relation model over\nregression and classification models in the selection phase. Furthermore, the\nsurrogate-selected unevaluated solutions with high potential have been shown to\nsignificantly enhance the efficiency of the algorithm.",

Most classical\ntechniques assume that the dataset is independent of the analyst's query and\nbreak down in the common setting where a dataset is reused for multiple,\nadaptively chosen, queries. This problem of \\emph{adaptive data analysis} was\nformalized in the seminal works of Dwork et al. (STOC, 2015) and Hardt and\nUllman (FOCS, 2014).\n\nWe identify a remarkably simple set of assumptions under which the queries\nwill continue to be representative even when chosen adaptively: The only\nrequirements are that each query takes as input a random subsample and outputs\nfew bits. This result shows that the noise inherent in subsampling is\nsufficient to guarantee that query responses generalize. The simplicity of this\nsubsampling-based framework allows it to model a variety of real-world\nscenarios not covered by prior work.\n\nIn addition to its simplicity, we demonstrate the utility of this framework\nby designing mechanisms for two foundational tasks, statistical queries and\nmedian finding. In particular, our mechanism for answering the broadly\napplicable class of statistical queries is both extremely simple and state of\nthe art in many parameter regimes.",

          "description": "Privacy-preserving learning of gradient boosting decision trees (GBDT) has\nthe potential for strong utility-privacy tradeoffs for tabular data, such as\ncensus data or medical meta data: classical GBDT learners can extract\nnon-linear patterns from small sized datasets. The state-of-the-art notion for\nprovable privacy-properties is differential privacy, which requires that the\nimpact of single data points is limited and deniable. We introduce a novel\ndifferentially private GBDT learner and utilize four main techniques to improve\nthe utility-privacy tradeoff. (1) We use an improved noise scaling approach\nwith tighter accounting of privacy leakage of a decision tree leaf compared to\nprior work, resulting in noise that in expectation scales with $O(1/n)$, for\n$n$ data points. (2) We integrate individual R\\'enyi filters to our method to\nlearn from data points that have been underutilized during an iterative\ntraining process, which -- potentially of independent interest -- results in a\nnatural yet effective insight to learning streams of non-i.i.d. data. (3) We\nincorporate the concept of random decision tree splits to concentrate privacy\nbudget on learning leaves. (4) We deploy subsampling for privacy amplification.\nOur evaluation shows for the Abalone dataset ($<4k$ training data points) a\n$R^2$-score of $0.39$ for $\\varepsilon=0.15$, which the closest prior work only\nachieved for $\\varepsilon=10.0$.

          "description": "Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is crucial to modern deep learning\napplications by identifying and alerting about the OOD samples that should not\nbe tested or used for making predictions. Current OOD detection methods have\nmade significant progress when in-distribution (ID) and OOD samples are drawn\nfrom static distributions. However, this can be unrealistic when applied to\nreal-world systems which often undergo continuous variations and shifts in ID\nand OOD distributions over time. Therefore, for an effective application in\nreal-world systems, the development of OOD detection methods that can adapt to\nthese dynamic and evolving distributions is essential. In this paper, we\npropose a novel and more realistic setting called continuously adaptive\nout-of-distribution (CAOOD) detection which targets on developing an OOD\ndetection model that enables dynamic and quick adaptation to a new arriving\ndistribution, with insufficient ID samples during deployment time. To address\nCAOOD, we develop meta OOD learning (MOL) by designing a learning-to-adapt\ndiagram such that a good initialized OOD detection model is learned during the\ntraining process. In the testing process, MOL ensures OOD detection performance\nover shifting distributions by quickly adapting to new distributions with a few\nadaptations. Extensive experiments on several OOD benchmarks endorse the\neffectiveness of our method in preserving both ID classification accuracy and\nOOD detection performance on continuously shifting distributions.",

          "description": "We expose a surprising failure of generalization in auto-regressive large\nlanguage models (LLMs). If a model is trained on a sentence of the form \"A is\nB\", it will not automatically generalize to the reverse direction \"B is A\".\nThis is the Reversal Curse. For instance, if a model is trained on \"Olaf Scholz\nwas the ninth Chancellor of Germany\", it will not automatically be able to\nanswer the question, \"Who was the ninth Chancellor of Germany?\". Moreover, the\nlikelihood of the correct answer (\"Olaf Scholz\") will not be higher than for a\nrandom name. Thus, models exhibit a basic failure of logical deduction and do\nnot generalize a prevalent pattern in their training set (i.e. if \"A is B''\noccurs, \"B is A\" is more likely to occur). We provide evidence for the Reversal\nCurse by finetuning GPT-3 and Llama-1 on fictitious statements such as \"Uriah\nHawthorne is the composer of 'Abyssal Melodies'\" and showing that they fail to\ncorrectly answer \"Who composed 'Abyssal Melodies?'\". The Reversal Curse is\nrobust across model sizes and model families and is not alleviated by data\naugmentation. We also evaluate ChatGPT (GPT-3.5 and GPT-4) on questions about\nreal-world celebrities, such as \"Who is Tom Cruise's mother? [A: Mary Lee\nPfeiffer]\" and the reverse \"Who is Mary Lee Pfeiffer's son?\". GPT-4 correctly\nanswers questions like the former 79% of the time, compared to 33% for the\nlatter.

To aggravate the issue, most CD methods do not\nprovide uncertainty estimates, making it hard for users to interpret results\nand improve the inference process. Surprisingly, while CD is a human-centered\naffair, no works have focused on building methods that both 1) output\nuncertainty estimates that can be verified by experts and 2) interact with\nthose experts to iteratively refine CD. To solve these issues, we start by\nproposing to sample (causal) ancestral graphs proportionally to a belief\ndistribution based on a score function, such as the Bayesian information\ncriterion (BIC), using generative flow networks. Then, we leverage the\ndiversity in candidate graphs and introduce an optimal experimental design to\niteratively probe the expert about the relations among variables, effectively\nreducing the uncertainty of our belief over ancestral graphs. Finally, we\nupdate our samples to incorporate human feedback via importance sampling.\nImportantly, our method does not require causal sufficiency (i.e., unobserved\nconfounders may exist).

A key challenge in this setting is the so-called\n\"catastrophic forgetting problem\", in which the performance of the learner in\nan \"old task\" decreases when subsequently trained on a \"new task\". Existing\ncontinual learning methods, such as Averaged Gradient Episodic Memory (A-GEM)\nand Orthogonal Gradient Descent (OGD), address catastrophic forgetting by\nminimizing the loss for the current task without increasing the loss for\nprevious tasks. However, these methods assume the learner knows when the task\nchanges, which is unrealistic in practice. In this paper, we alleviate the need\nto provide the algorithm with information about task changes by using an online\nclustering-based approach on a dynamically updated finite pool of samples or\ngradients. We thereby successfully counteract catastrophic forgetting in one of\nthe hardest settings, namely: domain-incremental learning, a setting for which\nthe problem was previously unsolved. We showcase the benefits of our approach\nby applying these ideas to projection-based methods, such as A-GEM and OGD,\nwhich lead to task-agnostic versions of them. Experiments on real datasets\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed strategy and its promising\nperformance compared to state-of-the-art methods.",

          "description": "New roads are being constructed all the time. However, the capabilities of\nprevious deep forecasting models to generalize to new roads not seen in the\ntraining data (unseen roads) are rarely explored. In this paper, we introduce a\nnovel setup called a spatio-temporal (ST) split to evaluate the models'\ncapabilities to generalize to unseen roads. In this setup, the models are\ntrained on data from a sample of roads, but tested on roads not seen in the\ntraining data. Moreover, we also present a novel framework called Spatial\nContrastive Pre-Training (SCPT) where we introduce a spatial encoder module to\nextract latent features from unseen roads during inference time. This spatial\nencoder is pre-trained using contrastive learning. During inference, the\nspatial encoder only requires two days of traffic data on the new roads and\ndoes not require any re-training. We also show that the output from the spatial\nencoder can be used effectively to infer latent node embeddings on unseen roads\nduring inference time. The SCPT framework also incorporates a new layer, named\nthe spatially gated addition (SGA) layer, to effectively combine the latent\nfeatures from the output of the spatial encoder to existing backbones.\nAdditionally, since there is limited data on the unseen roads, we argue that it\nis better to decouple traffic signals to trivial-to-capture periodic signals\nand difficult-to-capture Markovian signals, and for the spatial encoder to only\nlearn the Markovian signals. Finally, we empirically evaluated SCPT using the\nST split setup on four real-world datasets. The results showed that adding SCPT\nto a backbone consistently improves forecasting performance on unseen roads.\nMore importantly, the improvements are greater when forecasting further into\nthe future.

          "description": "There is a correlation between adjacent channels of electroencephalogram\n(EEG), and how to represent this correlation is an issue that is currently\nbeing explored. In addition, due to inter-individual differences in EEG\nsignals, this discrepancy results in new subjects need spend a amount of\ncalibration time for EEG-based motor imagery brain-computer interface. In order\nto solve the above problems, we propose a Dynamic Domain Adaptation Based Deep\nLearning Network (DADL-Net). First, the EEG data is mapped to the\nthree-dimensional geometric space and its temporal-spatial features are learned\nthrough the 3D convolution module, and then the spatial-channel attention\nmechanism is used to strengthen the features, and the final convolution module\ncan further learn the spatial-temporal information of the features. Finally, to\naccount for inter-subject and cross-sessions differences, we employ a dynamic\ndomain-adaptive strategy, the distance between features is reduced by\nintroducing a Maximum Mean Discrepancy loss function, and the classification\nlayer is fine-tuned by using part of the target domain data. We verify the\nperformance of the proposed method on BCI competition IV 2a and OpenBMI\ndatasets. Under the intra-subject experiment, the accuracy rates of 70.42% and\n73.91% were achieved on the OpenBMI and BCIC IV 2a datasets.",

Negligence of such self-interested behaviors can significantly affect\nthe learning efficiency and even the practical operability of federated bandit\nlearning. In light of this, we aim to spark new insights into this\nunder-explored research area by formally introducing an incentivized\ncommunication problem for federated bandits, where the server shall motivate\nclients to share data by providing incentives. Without loss of generality, we\ninstantiate this bandit problem with the contextual linear setting and propose\nthe first incentivized communication protocol, namely, Inc-FedUCB, that\nachieves near-optimal regret with provable communication and incentive cost\nguarantees.

          "description": "Federated learning is a distributed machine learning system that uses\nparticipants' data to train an improved global model. In federated learning,\nparticipants cooperatively train a global model, and they will receive the\nglobal model and payments. Rational participants try to maximize their\nindividual utility, and they will not input their high-quality data truthfully\nunless they are provided with satisfactory payments based on their data\nquality. Furthermore, federated learning benefits from the cooperative\ncontributions of participants. Accordingly, how to establish an incentive\nmechanism that both incentivizes inputting data truthfully and promotes stable\ncooperation has become an important issue to consider. In this paper, we\nintroduce a data sharing game model for federated learning and employ\ngame-theoretic approaches to design a core-selecting incentive mechanism by\nutilizing a popular concept in cooperative games, the core. In federated\nlearning, the core can be empty, resulting in the core-selecting mechanism\nbecoming infeasible. To address this, our core-selecting mechanism employs a\nrelaxation method and simultaneously minimizes the benefits of inputting false\ndata for all participants. However, this mechanism is computationally expensive\nbecause it requires aggregating exponential models for all possible coalitions,\nwhich is infeasible in federated learning. To address this, we propose an\nefficient core-selecting mechanism based on sampling approximation that only\naggregates models on sampled coalitions to approximate the exact result.\nExtensive experiments verify that the efficient core-selecting mechanism can\nincentivize inputting high-quality data and stable cooperation, while it\nreduces computational overhead compared to the core-selecting mechanism.",

Given the\npotential malicious nature in which these LLMs can be used to generate\ndisinformation at scale, it is important to build effective detectors for such\nAI-generated text. Given the surge in development of new LLMs, acquiring\nlabeled training data for supervised detectors is a bottleneck.

          "description": "Quantum machine learning is a promising programming paradigm for the\noptimization of quantum algorithms in the current era of noisy intermediate\nscale quantum (NISQ) computers. A fundamental challenge in quantum machine\nlearning is generalization, as the designer targets performance under testing\nconditions, while having access only to limited training data. Existing\ngeneralization analyses, while identifying important general trends and scaling\nlaws, cannot be used to assign reliable and informative \"error bars\" to the\ndecisions made by quantum models. In this article, we propose a general\nmethodology that can reliably quantify the uncertainty of quantum models,\nirrespective of the amount of training data, of the number of shots, of the\nansatz, of the training algorithm, and of the presence of quantum hardware\nnoise. The approach, which builds on probabilistic conformal prediction, turns\nan arbitrary, possibly small, number of shots from a pre-trained quantum model\ninto a set prediction, e.g., an interval, that provably contains the true\ntarget with any desired coverage level. Experimental results confirm the\ntheoretical calibration guarantees of the proposed framework, referred to as\nquantum conformal prediction.",

          "description": "Hierarchical reinforcement learning has been a compelling approach for\nachieving goal directed behavior over long sequences of actions. However, it\nhas been challenging to implement in realistic or open-ended environments. A\nmain challenge has been to find the right space of sub-goals over which to\ninstantiate a hierarchy. We present a novel approach where we use data from\nhumans solving these tasks to softly supervise the goal space for a set of long\nrange tasks in a 3D embodied environment. In particular, we use unconstrained\nnatural language to parameterize this space. This has two advantages: first, it\nis easy to generate this data from naive human participants; second, it is\nflexible enough to represent a vast range of sub-goals in human-relevant tasks.\nOur approach outperforms agents that clone expert behavior on these tasks, as\nwell as HRL from scratch without this supervised sub-goal space.

          "description": "Generalized Additive Models (GAMs) are widely used explainable-by-design\nmodels in various applications. GAMs assume that the output can be represented\nas a sum of univariate functions, referred to as components. However, this\nassumption fails in ML problems where the output depends on multiple features\nsimultaneously. In these cases, GAMs fail to capture the interaction terms of\nthe underlying function, leading to subpar accuracy. To (partially) address\nthis issue, we propose Regionally Additive Models (RAMs), a novel class of\nexplainable-by-design models. RAMs identify subregions within the feature space\nwhere interactions are minimized. Within these regions, it is more accurate to\nexpress the output as a sum of univariate functions (components). Consequently,\nRAMs fit one component per subregion of each feature instead of one component\nper feature. This approach yields a more expressive model compared to GAMs\nwhile retaining interpretability. The RAM framework consists of three steps.\nFirstly, we train a black-box model. Secondly, using Regional Effect Plots, we\nidentify subregions where the black-box model exhibits near-local additivity.\nLastly, we fit a GAM component for each identified subregion. We validate the\neffectiveness of RAMs through experiments on both synthetic and real-world\ndatasets. The results confirm that RAMs offer improved expressiveness compared\nto GAMs while maintaining interpretability.",

          "description": "The use of skills (a.k.a., options) can greatly accelerate exploration in\nreinforcement learning, especially when only sparse reward signals are\navailable. While option discovery methods have been proposed for individual\nagents, in multi-agent reinforcement learning settings, discovering\ncollaborative options that can coordinate the behavior of multiple agents and\nencourage them to visit the under-explored regions of their joint state space\nhas not been considered. In this case, we propose Multi-agent Deep Covering\nOption Discovery, which constructs the multi-agent options through minimizing\nthe expected cover time of the multiple agents' joint state space. Also, we\npropose a novel framework to adopt the multi-agent options in the MARL process.\nIn practice, a multi-agent task can usually be divided into some sub-tasks,\neach of which can be completed by a sub-group of the agents. Therefore, our\nalgorithm framework first leverages an attention mechanism to find\ncollaborative agent sub-groups that would benefit most from coordinated\nactions. Then, a hierarchical algorithm, namely HA-MSAC, is developed to learn\nthe multi-agent options for each sub-group to complete their sub-tasks first,\nand then to integrate them through a high-level policy as the solution of the\nwhole task. This hierarchical option construction allows our framework to\nstrike a balance between scalability and effective collaboration among the\nagents. The evaluation based on multi-agent collaborative tasks shows that the\nproposed algorithm can effectively capture the agent interactions with the\nattention mechanism, successfully identify multi-agent options, and\nsignificantly outperforms prior works using single-agent options or no options,\nin terms of both faster exploration and higher task rewards.",

          "description": "Designing reward functions is a longstanding challenge in reinforcement\nlearning (RL); it requires specialized knowledge or domain data, leading to\nhigh costs for development. To address this, we introduce Text2Reward, a\ndata-free framework that automates the generation of dense reward functions\nbased on large language models (LLMs). Given a goal described in natural\nlanguage, Text2Reward generates dense reward functions as an executable program\ngrounded in a compact representation of the environment. Unlike inverse RL and\nrecent work that uses LLMs to write sparse reward codes, Text2Reward produces\ninterpretable, free-form dense reward codes that cover a wide range of tasks,\nutilize existing packages, and allow iterative refinement with human feedback.\nWe evaluate Text2Reward on two robotic manipulation benchmarks (ManiSkill2,\nMetaWorld) and two locomotion environments of MuJoCo. On 13 of the 17\nmanipulation tasks, policies trained with generated reward codes achieve\nsimilar or better task success rates and convergence speed than expert-written\nreward codes. For locomotion tasks, our method learns six novel locomotion\nbehaviors with a success rate exceeding 94%. Furthermore, we show that the\npolicies trained in the simulator with our method can be deployed in the real\nworld. Finally, Text2Reward further improves the policies by refining their\nreward functions with human feedback. Video results are available at\nhttps://text-to-reward.github.io",

          "description": "Quantization of deep neural networks (DNN) has become a key element in the\nefforts of embedding such networks on end-user devices. However, current\nquantization methods usually suffer from costly accuracy degradation. In this\npaper, we propose a new method for Enhanced Post Training Quantization named\nEPTQ. The method is based on knowledge distillation with an adaptive weighting\nof layers. In addition, we introduce a new label-free technique for\napproximating the Hessian trace of the task loss, named Label-Free Hessian.\nThis technique removes the requirement of a labeled dataset for computing the\nHessian. The adaptive knowledge distillation uses the Label-Free Hessian\ntechnique to give greater attention to the sensitive parts of the model while\nperforming the optimization. Empirically, by employing EPTQ we achieve\nstate-of-the-art results on a wide variety of models, tasks, and datasets,\nincluding ImageNet classification, COCO object detection, and Pascal-VOC for\nsemantic segmentation. We demonstrate the performance and compatibility of EPTQ\non an extended set of architectures, including CNNs, Transformers, hybrid, and\nMLP-only models.",

          "description": "This paper introduces Bayesian Flow Networks (BFNs), a new class of\ngenerative model in which the parameters of a set of independent distributions\nare modified with Bayesian inference in the light of noisy data samples, then\npassed as input to a neural network that outputs a second, interdependent\ndistribution. Starting from a simple prior and iteratively updating the two\ndistributions yields a generative procedure similar to the reverse process of\ndiffusion models; however it is conceptually simpler in that no forward process\nis required. Discrete and continuous-time loss functions are derived for\ncontinuous, discretised and discrete data, along with sample generation\nprocedures. Notably, the network inputs for discrete data lie on the\nprobability simplex, and are therefore natively differentiable, paving the way\nfor gradient-based sample guidance and few-step generation in discrete domains\nsuch as language modelling. The loss function directly optimises data\ncompression and places no restrictions on the network architecture. In our\nexperiments BFNs achieve competitive log-likelihoods for image modelling on\ndynamically binarized MNIST and CIFAR-10, and outperform all known discrete\ndiffusion models on the text8 character-level language modelling task.",

To achieve this, the recommendation process must carefully\nconsider the region's natural, environmental, resource, and economic\ncharacteristics. However, current recommendation algorithms in the field of\ncomputer science fall short in adequately addressing the spatial heterogeneity\nrelated to environment and sparsity of regional historical interaction data,\nwhich limits their effectiveness in recommending sustainable development\npatterns. To overcome these challenges, this paper proposes a method called\nUser Graph after Pruning and Intent Graph (UGPIG). Firstly, we utilize the\nhigh-density linking capability of the pruned User Graph to address the issue\nof spatial heterogeneity neglect in recommendation algorithms. Secondly, we\nconstruct an Intent Graph by incorporating the intent network, which captures\nthe preferences for attributes including environmental elements of target\nregions. This approach effectively alleviates the problem of sparse historical\ninteraction data in the region. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate\nthat UGPIG outperforms state-of-the-art recommendation algorithms like KGCN,\nKGAT, and KGIN in sustainable development pattern recommendations, with a\nmaximum improvement of 9.61% in Top-3 recommendation performance.",

          "description": "We consider the problem of training private recommendation models with access\nto public item features. Training with Differential Privacy (DP) offers strong\nprivacy guarantees, at the expense of loss in recommendation quality. We show\nthat incorporating public item features during training can help mitigate this\nloss in quality. We propose a general approach based on collective matrix\nfactorization (CMF), that works by simultaneously factorizing two matrices: the\nuser feedback matrix (representing sensitive data) and an item feature matrix\nthat encodes publicly available (non-sensitive) item information.\n\nThe method is conceptually simple, easy to tune, and highly scalable. It can\nbe applied to different types of public item data, including: (1) categorical\nitem features; (2) item-item similarities learned from public sources; and (3)\npublicly available user feedback. Furthermore, these data modalities can be\ncollectively utilized to fully leverage public data.\n\nEvaluating our method on a standard DP recommendation benchmark, we find that\nusing public item features significantly narrows the quality gap between\nprivate models and their non-private counterparts. As privacy constraints\nbecome more stringent, models rely more heavily on public side features for\nrecommendation. This results in a smooth transition from collaborative\nfiltering to item-based contextual recommendations.",

          "description": "Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) that integrate text and other\nmodalities (especially vision) have achieved unprecedented performance in\nvarious multimodal tasks. However, due to the unsolved adversarial robustness\nproblem of vision models, MLLMs can have more severe safety and security risks\nby introducing the vision inputs. In this work, we study the adversarial\nrobustness of Google's Bard, a competitive chatbot to ChatGPT that released its\nmultimodal capability recently, to better understand the vulnerabilities of\ncommercial MLLMs. By attacking white-box surrogate vision encoders or MLLMs,\nthe generated adversarial examples can mislead Bard to output wrong image\ndescriptions with a 22% success rate based solely on the transferability. We\nshow that the adversarial examples can also attack other MLLMs, e.g., a 26%\nattack success rate against Bing Chat and a 86% attack success rate against\nERNIE bot. Moreover, we identify two defense mechanisms of Bard, including face\ndetection and toxicity detection of images. We design corresponding attacks to\nevade these defenses, demonstrating that the current defenses of Bard are also\nvulnerable. We hope this work can deepen our understanding on the robustness of\nMLLMs and facilitate future research on defenses. Our code is available at\nhttps://github.com/thu-ml/Attack-Bard.",

          "description": "Self-supervised representation learning has seen remarkable progress in the\nlast few years, with some of the recent methods being able to learn useful\nimage representations without labels. These methods are trained using\nbackpropagation, the de facto standard. Recently, Geoffrey Hinton proposed the\nforward-forward algorithm as an alternative training method. It utilizes two\nforward passes and a separate loss function for each layer to train the network\nwithout backpropagation.\n\nIn this study, for the first time, we study the performance of\nforward-forward vs. backpropagation for self-supervised representation learning\nand provide insights into the learned representation spaces. Our benchmark\nemploys four standard datasets, namely MNIST, F-MNIST, SVHN and CIFAR-10, and\nthree commonly used self-supervised representation learning techniques, namely\nrotation, flip and jigsaw.\n\nOur main finding is that while the forward-forward algorithm performs\ncomparably to backpropagation during (self-)supervised training, the transfer\nperformance is significantly lagging behind in all the studied settings. This\nmay be caused by a combination of factors, including having a loss function for\neach layer and the way the supervised training is realized in the\nforward-forward paradigm. In comparison to backpropagation, the forward-forward\nalgorithm focuses more on the boundaries and drops part of the information\nunnecessary for making decisions which harms the representation learning goal.\nFurther investigation and research are necessary to stabilize the\nforward-forward strategy for self-supervised learning, to work beyond the\ndatasets and configurations demonstrated by Geoffrey Hinton.",

          "description": "Many applications of cross-modal music retrieval are related to connecting\nsheet music images to audio recordings. A typical and recent approach to this\nis to learn, via deep neural networks, a joint embedding space that correlates\nshort fixed-size snippets of audio and sheet music by means of an appropriate\nsimilarity structure. However, two challenges that arise out of this strategy\nare the requirement of strongly aligned data to train the networks, and the\ninherent discrepancies of musical content between audio and sheet music\nsnippets caused by local and global tempo differences. In this paper, we\naddress these two shortcomings by designing a cross-modal recurrent network\nthat learns joint embeddings that can summarize longer passages of\ncorresponding audio and sheet music. The benefits of our method are that it\nonly requires weakly aligned audio-sheet music pairs, as well as that the\nrecurrent network handles the non-linearities caused by tempo variations\nbetween audio and sheet music. We conduct a number of experiments on synthetic\nand real piano data and scores, showing that our proposed recurrent method\nleads to more accurate retrieval in all possible configurations.",

          "description": "While training fair machine learning models has been studied extensively in\nrecent years, most developed methods rely on the assumption that the training\nand test data have similar distributions.

Moreover, existing algorithms require full access to data and cannot\nbe used when small batches are used (stochastic/batch implementation).

          "description": "Ad-load balancing is a critical challenge in online advertising systems,\nparticularly in the context of social media platforms, where the goal is to\nmaximize user engagement and revenue while maintaining a satisfactory user\nexperience. This requires the optimization of conflicting objectives, such as\nuser satisfaction and ads revenue. Traditional approaches to ad-load balancing\nrely on static allocation policies, which fail to adapt to changing user\npreferences and contextual factors. In this paper, we present an approach that\nleverages off-policy learning and evaluation from logged bandit feedback. We\nstart by presenting a motivating analysis of the ad-load balancing problem,\nhighlighting the conflicting objectives between user satisfaction and ads\nrevenue. We emphasize the nuances that arise due to user heterogeneity and the\ndependence on the user's position within a session. Based on this analysis, we\ndefine the problem as determining the optimal ad-load for a particular feed\nfetch. To tackle this problem, we propose an off-policy learning framework that\nleverages unbiased estimators such as Inverse Propensity Scoring (IPS) and\nDoubly Robust (DR) to learn and estimate the policy values using offline\ncollected stochastic data. We present insights from online A/B experiments\ndeployed at scale across over 80 million users generating over 200 million\nsessions, where we find statistically significant improvements in both user\nsatisfaction metrics and ads revenue for the platform.",

          "description": "With increasing frequency of high-profile privacy breaches in various online\nplatforms, users are becoming more concerned about their privacy. And\nrecommender system is the core component of online platforms for providing\npersonalized service, consequently, its privacy preservation has attracted\ngreat attention. As the gold standard of privacy protection, differential\nprivacy has been widely adopted to preserve privacy in recommender systems.\nHowever, existing differentially private recommender systems only consider\nstatic and independent interactions, so they cannot apply to sequential\nrecommendation where behaviors are dynamic and dependent. Meanwhile, little\nattention has been paid on the privacy risk of sensitive user features, most of\nthem only protect user feedbacks. In this work, we propose a novel\nDIfferentially Private Sequential recommendation framework with a noisy Graph\nNeural Network approach (denoted as DIPSGNN) to address these limitations. To\nthe best of our knowledge, we are the first to achieve differential privacy in\nsequential recommendation with dependent interactions. Specifically, in\nDIPSGNN, we first leverage piecewise mechanism to protect sensitive user\nfeatures. Then, we innovatively add calibrated noise into aggregation step of\ngraph neural network based on aggregation perturbation mechanism. And this\nnoisy graph neural network can protect sequentially dependent interactions and\ncapture user preferences simultaneously. Extensive experiments demonstrate the\nsuperiority of our method over state-of-the-art differentially private\nrecommender systems in terms of better balance between privacy and accuracy.",

Our work presents\nquantitative results that support the structural performance of the generated\ndesigns and the variability in potential candidate designs. Furthermore, we\nprovide evidence of the scalability of our framework by operating over voxel\ndomains with resolutions varying from $32^3$ to $128^3$.

On the other hand, these steps are\nbecoming ever increasingly delicate due to the extensive rise in the number,\ndiversity, and distributedness of machine learning resources. Multi-agent\nsystems, when applied to the design of machine learning platforms, bring about\nseveral distinctive characteristics such as scalability, flexibility, and\nrobustness, just to name a few. This paper proposes a fully automatic and\ncollaborative agent-based mechanism for selecting distributedly organized\nmachine learning algorithms and simultaneously tuning their hyperparameters.\nOur method builds upon an existing agent-based hierarchical machine-learning\nplatform and augments its query structure to support the aforementioned\nfunctionalities without being limited to specific learning, selection, and\ntuning mechanisms. We have conducted theoretical assessments, formal\nverification, and analytical study to demonstrate the correctness, resource\nutilization, and computational efficiency of our technique. According to the\nresults, our solution is totally correct and exhibits linear time and space\ncomplexity in relation to the size of available resources. To provide concrete\nexamples of how the proposed methodologies can effectively adapt and perform\nacross a range of algorithmic options and datasets, we have also conducted a\nseries of experiments using a system comprised of 24 algorithms and 9 datasets.",

          "description": "Traffic prediction is a crucial topic because of its broad scope of\napplications in the transportation domain. Recently, various studies have\nachieved promising results. However, most studies assume the prediction\nlocations have complete or at least partial historical records and cannot be\nextended to non-historical recorded locations. In real-life scenarios, the\ndeployment of sensors could be limited due to budget limitations and\ninstallation availability, which makes most current models not applicable.\nThough few pieces of literature tried to impute traffic states at the missing\nlocations, these methods need the data simultaneously observed at the locations\nwith sensors, making them not applicable to prediction tasks. Another drawback\nis the lack of measurement of uncertainty in prediction, making prior works\nunsuitable for risk-sensitive tasks or involving decision-making. To fill the\ngap, inspired by the previous inductive graph neural network, this work\nproposed an uncertainty-aware framework with the ability to 1) extend\nprediction to missing locations with no historical records and significantly\nextend spatial coverage of prediction locations while reducing deployment of\nsensors and 2) generate probabilistic prediction with uncertainty\nquantification to help the management of risk and decision making in the\ndown-stream tasks. Through extensive experiments on real-life datasets, the\nresult shows our method achieved promising results on prediction tasks, and the\nuncertainty quantification gives consistent results which highly correlated\nwith the locations with and without historical data. We also show that our\nmodel could help support sensor deployment tasks in the transportation field to\nachieve higher accuracy with a limited sensor deployment budget.",

          "description": "As recently demonstrated, Deep Neural Networks (DNN), usually trained using\nsingle precision IEEE 754 floating point numbers (binary32), can also work\nusing lower precision. Therefore, 16-bit and 8-bit compressed format have\nattracted considerable attention. In this paper, we focused on two families of\nformats that have already achieved interesting results in compressing binary32\nnumbers in machine learning applications, without sensible degradation of the\naccuracy: bfloat and posit. Even if 16-bit and 8-bit bfloat/posit are routinely\nused for reducing the storage of the weights/biases of trained DNNs, the\ninference still often happens on the 32-bit FPU of the CPU (especially if GPUs\nare not available).

          "description": "Since Large Language Models or LLMs have demonstrated high-quality\nperformance on many complex language tasks, there is a great interest in\nbringing these LLMs to mobile devices for faster responses and better privacy\nprotection. However, the size of LLMs (i.e., billions of parameters) requires\nhighly effective compression to fit into storage-limited devices. Among many\ncompression techniques, weight-clustering, a form of non-linear quantization,\nis one of the leading candidates for LLM compression, and supported by modern\nsmartphones. Yet, its training overhead is prohibitively significant for LLM\nfine-tuning. Especially, Differentiable KMeans Clustering, or DKM, has shown\nthe state-of-the-art trade-off between compression ratio and accuracy\nregression, but its large memory complexity makes it nearly impossible to apply\nto train-time LLM compression. In this paper, we propose a memory-efficient DKM\nimplementation, eDKM powered by novel techniques to reduce the memory footprint\nof DKM by orders of magnitudes. For a given tensor to be saved on CPU for the\nbackward pass of DKM, we compressed the tensor by applying uniquification and\nsharding after checking if there is no duplicated tensor previously copied to\nCPU. Our experimental results demonstrate that \\prjname can fine-tune and\ncompress a pretrained LLaMA 7B model from 12.6 GB to 2.5 GB (3bit/weight) with\nthe Alpaca dataset by reducing the train-time memory footprint of a decoder\nlayer by 130$\\times$, while delivering good accuracy on broader LLM benchmarks\n(i.e., 77.7% for PIQA, 66.1% for Winograde, and so on).",

The graph neural fingerprint\nmodels yield high prediction accuracy on docking scores with the mean squared\nerror lower than $0.21$ kcal/mol for most of the docking targets, showing\nsignificant improvement over conventional circular fingerprint methods. To make\nthe neural fingerprints transferable for unknown targets, we also propose a\ntransferable graph neural fingerprint method trained on multiple targets.

          "description": "Grasping inhomogeneous objects in real-world applications remains a\nchallenging task due to the unknown physical properties such as mass\ndistribution and coefficient of friction. In this study, we propose a\nmeta-learning algorithm called ConDex, which incorporates Conditional Neural\nProcesses (CNP) with DexNet-2.0 to autonomously discern the underlying physical\nproperties of objects using depth images. ConDex efficiently acquires physical\nembeddings from limited trials, enabling precise grasping point estimation.\nFurthermore, ConDex is capable of updating the predicted grasping quality\niteratively from new trials in an online fashion. To the best of our knowledge,\nwe are the first who generate two object datasets focusing on inhomogeneous\nphysical properties with varying mass distributions and friction coefficients.\nExtensive evaluations in simulation demonstrate ConDex's superior performance\nover DexNet-2.0 and existing meta-learning-based grasping pipelines.\nFurthermore, ConDex shows robust generalization to previously unseen real-world\nobjects despite training solely in the simulation. The synthetic and real-world\ndatasets will be published as well.",

          "description": "Spatial-temporal data contains rich information and has been widely studied\nin recent years due to the rapid development of relevant applications in many\nfields. For instance, medical institutions often use electrodes attached to\ndifferent parts of a patient to analyse the electorencephal data rich with\nspatial and temporal features for health assessment and disease diagnosis.\nExisting research has mainly used deep learning techniques such as\nconvolutional neural network (CNN) or recurrent neural network (RNN) to extract\nhidden spatial-temporal features. Yet, it is challenging to incorporate both\ninter-dependencies spatial information and dynamic temporal changes\nsimultaneously. In reality, for a model that leverages these spatial-temporal\nfeatures to fulfil complex prediction tasks, it often requires a colossal\namount of training data in order to obtain satisfactory model performance.\nConsidering the above-mentioned challenges, we propose an adaptive federated\nrelevance framework, namely FedRel, for spatial-temporal graph learning in this\npaper. After transforming the raw spatial-temporal data into high quality\nfeatures, the core Dynamic Inter-Intra Graph (DIIG) module in the framework is\nable to use these features to generate the spatial-temporal graphs capable of\ncapturing the hidden topological and long-term temporal correlation information\nin these graphs.

We then aggregate these potentially\nnoisy labels using weak supervision in order to predict content veracity. We\ndemonstrate that our approach, which combines zero-shot LLM credibility signal\nlabeling and weak supervision, outperforms state-of-the-art classifiers on two\nmisinformation datasets without using any ground-truth labels for training. We\nalso analyse the contribution of the individual credibility signals towards\npredicting content veracity, which provides new valuable insights into their\nrole in misinformation detection.",

          "description": "Despite the many successful applications of deep learning models for\nmultidimensional signal and image processing, most traditional neural networks\nprocess data represented by (multidimensional) arrays of real numbers. The\nintercorrelation between feature channels is usually expected to be learned\nfrom the training data, requiring numerous parameters and careful training. In\ncontrast, vector-valued neural networks are conceived to process arrays of\nvectors and naturally consider the intercorrelation between feature channels.\nConsequently, they usually have fewer parameters and often undergo more robust\ntraining than traditional neural networks. This paper aims to present a broad\nframework for vector-valued neural networks, referred to as V-nets. In this\ncontext, hypercomplex-valued neural networks are regarded as vector-valued\nmodels with additional algebraic properties. Furthermore, this paper explains\nthe relationship between vector-valued and traditional neural networks.\nPrecisely, a vector-valued neural network can be obtained by placing\nrestrictions on a real-valued model to consider the intercorrelation between\nfeature channels. Finally, we show how V-nets, including hypercomplex-valued\nneural networks, can be implemented in current deep-learning libraries as\nreal-valued networks.",

We\nalso investigated different combinations of signal frequency ranges and EEG\nchannels to accurately diagnose PD. Finally, with a fewer number of features\n(11 features), we achieved a maximum classification accuracy (ARKF) of ~99.9%.\nThe most prominent frequency range of EEG signals has been identified, and we\nhave found that high classification accuracy depends on low-frequency signal\ncomponents (0-4 Hz). Moreover, the most informative signals were mainly\nreceived from the right hemisphere of the head (F8, P8, T8, FC6). Furthermore,\nwe assessed the accuracy of the diagnosis of PD using three different lengths\nof EEG data (150-1000 samples).

          "description": "Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is a progressive disease preceded by Mild Cognitive\nImpairment (MCI). Early detection of AD is crucial for making treatment\ndecisions. However, most of the literature on computer-assisted detection of AD\nfocuses on classifying brain images into one of three major categories:\nhealthy, MCI, and AD; or categorizing MCI patients into (1) progressive: those\nwho progress from MCI to AD at a future examination time, and (2) stable: those\nwho stay as MCI and never progress to AD. This misses the opportunity to\naccurately identify the trajectory of progressive MCI patients. In this paper,\nwe revisit the brain image classification task for AD identification and\nre-frame it as an ordinal classification task to predict how close a patient is\nto the severe AD stage. To this end, we select progressive MCI patients from\nthe Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset and construct an\nordinal dataset with a prediction target that indicates the time to progression\nto AD. We train a Siamese network model to predict the time to onset of AD\nbased on MRI brain images. We also propose a Weighted variety of Siamese\nnetwork and compare its performance to a baseline model. Our evaluations show\nthat incorporating a weighting factor to Siamese networks brings considerable\nperformance gain at predicting how close input brain MRI images are to\nprogressing to AD. Moreover, we complement our results with an interpretation\nof the learned embedding space of the Siamese networks using a model\nexplainability technique.",

          "description": "Reinforcement Learning views the maximization of rewards and avoidance of\npunishments as central to explaining goal-directed behavior. However, over a\nlife, organisms will need to learn about many different aspects of the world's\nstructure: the states of the world and state-vector transition dynamics. The\nnumber of combinations of states grows exponentially as an agent incorporates\nnew knowledge, and there is no obvious weighted combination of pre-existing\nrewards or costs defined for a given combination of states, as such a weighting\nwould need to encode information about good and bad combinations prior to an\nagent's experience in the world. Therefore, we must develop more naturalistic\naccounts of behavior and motivation in large state-spaces. We show that it is\npossible to use only the intrinsic motivation metric of empowerment, which\nmeasures the agent's capacity to realize many possible futures under a\ntransition operator. We propose to scale empowerment to hierarchical\nstate-spaces by using Operator Bellman Equations. These equations produce\nstate-time feasibility functions, which are compositional hierarchical\nstate-time transition operators that map an initial state and time when an\nagent begins a policy to the final states and times of completing a goal.\nBecause these functions are hierarchical operators we can define hierarchical\nempowerment measures on them. An agent can then optimize plans to distant\nstates and times to maximize its hierarchical empowerment-gain, allowing it to\ndiscover goals that bring about a more favorable coupling of its internal\nstructure (physiological states) to its external environment (world structure &\nspatial state). Life-long agents could therefore be primarily animated by\nprinciples of compositionality and empowerment, exhibiting self-concern for the\ngrowth & maintenance of their own structural integrity without recourse to\nreward-maximization.",

[Nature Communications\nhttps://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-023-36363-w (2023)], the authors present a deep\nreinforced learning approach to augment combinatorial optimization heuristics.\nIn particular, they present results for several spin glass ground state\nproblems, for which instances on non-planar networks are generally NP-hard, in\ncomparison with several Monte Carlo based methods, such as simulated annealing\n(SA) or parallel tempering (PT). Indeed, those results demonstrate that the\nreinforced learning improves the results over those obtained with SA or PT, or\nat least allows for reduced runtimes for the heuristics before results of\ncomparable quality have been obtained relative to those other methods. To\nfacilitate the conclusion that their method is ''superior'', the authors pursue\ntwo basic strategies: (1) A commercial GUROBI solver is called on to procure a\nsample of exact ground states as a testbed to compare with, and (2) a\nhead-to-head comparison between the heuristics is given for a sample of larger\ninstances where exact ground states are hard to ascertain. Here, we put these\nstudies into a larger context, showing that the claimed superiority is at best\nmarginal for smaller samples and becomes essentially irrelevant with respect to\nany sensible approximation of true ground states in the larger samples. For\nexample, this method becomes irrelevant as a means to determine stiffness\nexponents $\\theta$ in $d>2$, as mentioned by the authors, where the problem is\nnot only NP-hard but requires the subtraction of two almost equal ground-state\nenergies and systemic errors in each of $\\approx 1\\%$ found here are\nunacceptable.

          "description": "The marketplace system connecting demands and supplies has been explored to\ndevelop unbiased decision-making in valuing properties. Real estate appraisal\nserves as one of the high-cost property valuation tasks for financial\ninstitutions since it requires domain experts to appraise the estimation based\non the corresponding knowledge and the judgment of the market. Existing\nautomated valuation models reducing the subjectivity of domain experts require\na large number of transactions for effective evaluation, which is predominantly\nlimited to not only the labeling efforts of transactions but also the\ngeneralizability of new developing and rural areas. To learn representations\nfrom unlabeled real estate sets, existing self-supervised learning (SSL) for\ntabular data neglects various important features, and fails to incorporate\ndomain knowledge. In this paper, we propose DoRA, a Domain-based\nself-supervised learning framework for low-resource Real estate Appraisal. DoRA\nis pre-trained with an intra-sample geographic prediction as the pretext task\nbased on the metadata of the real estate for equipping the real estate\nrepresentations with prior domain knowledge. Furthermore, inter-sample\ncontrastive learning is employed to generalize the representations to be robust\nfor limited transactions of downstream tasks. Our benchmark results on three\nproperty types of real-world transactions show that DoRA significantly\noutperforms the SSL baselines for tabular data, the graph-based methods, and\nthe supervised approaches in the few-shot scenarios by at least 7.6% for MAPE,\n11.59% for MAE, and 3.34% for HR10%. We expect DoRA to be useful to other\nfinancial practitioners with similar marketplace applications who need general\nmodels for properties that are newly built and have limited records.

Until recently,\nmost of research works focused on API-based attacks that consider a ML model as\na pure algorithmic abstraction. However, new implementation-based threats have\nbeen revealed, emphasizing the urgency to propose both practical and\nsimulation-based methods to properly evaluate the robustness of models. A major\nconcern is parameter-based attacks (such as the Bit-Flip Attack, BFA) that\nhighlight the lack of robustness of typical deep neural network models when\nconfronted by accurate and optimal alterations of their internal parameters\nstored in memory. Setting in a security testing purpose, this work practically\nreports, for the first time, a successful variant of the BFA on a 32-bit\nCortex-M microcontroller using laser fault injection. It is a standard fault\ninjection means for security evaluation, that enables to inject spatially and\ntemporally accurate faults. To avoid unrealistic brute-force strategies, we\nshow how simulations help selecting the most sensitive set of bits from the\nparameters taking into account the laser fault model.",

However, if local variables have direct and indirect\ndependence simultaneously, the global optimization on score functions misses\nedges between variables with indirect dependent relationship, of which scores\nare smaller than those with direct dependent relationship. In this paper, we\npresent an identifiability condition based on a determined subset of parents to\nidentify the underlying DAG. By the identifiability condition, we develop a\ntwo-phase algorithm namely optimal-tuning (OT) algorithm to locally amend the\nglobal optimization. In the optimal phase, an optimization problem based on\nfirst-order Hilbert-Schmidt independence criterion (HSIC) gives an estimated\nskeleton as the initial determined parents subset. In the tuning phase, the\nskeleton is locally tuned by deletion, addition and DAG-formalization\nstrategies using the theoretically proved incremental properties of high-order\nHSIC. Numerical experiments for different synthetic datasets and real-world\ndatasets show that the OT algorithm outperforms existing methods.

          "description": "Focus in Explainable AI is shifting from explanations defined in terms of\nlow-level elements, such as input features, to explanations encoded in terms of\ninterpretable concepts learned from data. How to reliably acquire such concepts\nis, however, still fundamentally unclear. An agreed-upon notion of concept\ninterpretability is missing, with the result that concepts used by both\npost-hoc explainers and concept-based neural networks are acquired through a\nvariety of mutually incompatible strategies. Critically, most of these neglect\nthe human side of the problem: a representation is understandable only insofar\nas it can be understood by the human at the receiving end. The key challenge in\nHuman-interpretable Representation Learning (HRL) is how to model and\noperationalize this human element. In this work, we propose a mathematical\nframework for acquiring interpretable representations suitable for both\npost-hoc explainers and concept-based neural networks. Our formalization of HRL\nbuilds on recent advances in causal representation learning and explicitly\nmodels a human stakeholder as an external observer. This allows us to derive a\nprincipled notion of alignment between the machine representation and the\nvocabulary of concepts understood by the human. In doing so, we link alignment\nand interpretability through a simple and intuitive name transfer game, and\nclarify the relationship between alignment and a well-known property of\nrepresentations, namely disentanglment. We also show that alignment is linked\nto the issue of undesirable correlations among concepts, also known as concept\nleakage, and to content-style separation, all through a general\ninformation-theoretic reformulation of these properties. Our conceptualization\naims to bridge the gap between the human and algorithmic sides of\ninterpretability and establish a stepping stone for new research on\nhuman-interpretable representations.",

These newly defined quantities capture changes in the entropy of a\nvariable resulting from interventions on other variables. Fundamental results\nconnecting these quantities to the existence of causal effects are derived.

The\nresults show that the proposed method achieves higher decoding accuracy than\nthe state-of-the-art (SOTA) method (94.4% compared to XANet's 90.6%) with\n1-second decision window for the widely used KULeuven (KUL) dataset, and the\ncode to implement our work is available on Github:\n\nhttps://github.com/xuxiran/ASAD_DenseNet",

In this paper, we endeavor to design strategies to achieve\nuniversal adversarial robustness. To achieve this, we first investigate the\nrelatively less-explored realm of spatial robustness. Then, we integrate the\nexisting spatial robustness methods by incorporating both local and global\nspatial vulnerability into a unified spatial attack and adversarial training\napproach. Furthermore, we present a comprehensive relationship between natural\naccuracy, sensitivity-based robustness, and spatial robustness, supported by\nstrong evidence from the perspective of robust representation. Crucially, to\nreconcile the interplay between the mutual impacts of various robustness\ncomponents into one unified framework, we incorporate the \\textit{Pareto\ncriterion} into the adversarial robustness analysis, yielding a novel strategy\ncalled Pareto Adversarial Training for achieving universal robustness. The\nresulting Pareto front, which delineates the set of optimal solutions, provides\nan optimal balance between natural accuracy and various adversarial robustness.\nThis sheds light on solutions for achieving universal robustness in the future.\nTo the best of our knowledge, we are the first to consider universal\nadversarial robustness via multi-objective optimization.",

          "description": "Open-ended learning benefits immensely from the use of symbolic methods for\ngoal representation as they offer ways to structure knowledge for efficient and\ntransferable learning. However, the existing Hierarchical Reinforcement\nLearning (HRL) approaches relying on symbolic reasoning are often limited as\nthey require a manual goal representation. The challenge in autonomously\ndiscovering a symbolic goal representation is that it must preserve critical\ninformation, such as the environment dynamics. In this paper, we propose a\ndevelopmental mechanism for goal discovery via an emergent representation that\nabstracts (i.e., groups together) sets of environment states that have similar\nroles in the task. We introduce a Feudal HRL algorithm that concurrently learns\nboth the goal representation and a hierarchical policy. The algorithm uses\nsymbolic reachability analysis for neural networks to approximate the\ntransition relation among sets of states and to refine the goal representation.\nWe evaluate our approach on complex navigation tasks, showing the learned\nrepresentation is interpretable, transferrable and results in data efficient\nlearning.",

To this end,\nsemi-supervised domain adaptation (SSDA) on graphs aims to leverage the\nknowledge of a labeled source graph to aid in node classification on a target\ngraph with limited labels. SSDA tasks need to overcome the domain gap between\nthe source and target graphs. However, to date, this challenging research\nproblem has yet to be formally considered by the existing approaches designed\nfor cross-graph node classification. To tackle the SSDA problem on graphs, a\nnovel method called SemiGCL is proposed, which benefits from graph contrastive\nlearning and minimax entropy training. SemiGCL generates informative node\nrepresentations by contrasting the representations learned from a graph's local\nand global views. Additionally, SemiGCL is adversarially optimized with the\nentropy loss of unlabeled target nodes to reduce domain divergence.\nExperimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate that SemiGCL outperforms\nthe state-of-the-art baselines on the SSDA tasks.",

We demonstrate that the proposed KLUBs\nare more effective for optimizing beta diffusion compared to negative ELBOs,\nwhich can also be derived as the KLUBs of the same KL divergence with its two\narguments swapped. The loss function of beta diffusion, expressed in terms of\nBregman divergence, further supports the efficacy of KLUBs for optimization.\nExperimental results on both synthetic data and natural images demonstrate the\nunique capabilities of beta diffusion in generative modeling of range-bounded\ndata and validate the effectiveness of KLUBs in optimizing diffusion models,\nthereby making them valuable additions to the family of diffusion-based\ngenerative models and the optimization techniques used to train them.",

          "description": "UCI WorldTour races, the premier men's elite road cycling tour, are grueling\nevents that put physical fitness and endurance of riders to the test. The\ncoaches of Team Jumbo-Visma have long been responsible for predicting the\nenergy needs of each rider of the Dutch team for every race on the calendar.\nThose must be estimated to ensure riders have the energy and resources\nnecessary to maintain a high level of performance throughout a race. This task,\nhowever, is both time-consuming and challenging, as it requires precise\nestimates of race speed and power output. Traditionally, the approach to\npredicting energy needs has relied on judgement and experience of coaches, but\nthis method has its limitations and often leads to inaccurate predictions. In\nthis paper, we propose a new, more effective approach to predicting energy\nneeds for cycling races. By predicting the speed and power with regression\nmodels, we provide the coaches with calorie needs estimates for each individual\nrider per stage instantly. In addition, we compare methods to quantify\nuncertainty using conformal prediction. The empirical analysis of the\njackknife+, jackknife-minmax, jackknife-minmax-after-bootstrap, CV+, CV-minmax,\nconformalized quantile regression, and inductive conformal prediction methods\nin conformal prediction reveals that all methods achieve valid prediction\nintervals. All but minmax-based methods also produce sufficiently narrow\nprediction intervals for decision-making. Furthermore, methods computing\nprediction intervals of fixed size produce tighter intervals for low\nsignificance values. Among the methods computing intervals of varying length\nacross the input space, inductive conformal prediction computes narrower\nprediction intervals at larger significance level.",

          "description": "Purpose: Common to most MRSI techniques, the spatial resolution and the\nminimal scan duration of Deuterium Metabolic Imaging (DMI) are limited by the\nachievable SNR. This work presents a deep learning method for sensitivity\nenhancement of DMI.\n\nMethods: A convolutional neural network (CNN) was designed to estimate the\n2H-labeled metabolite concentrations from low SNR and distorted DMI FIDs. The\nCNN was trained with synthetic data that represent a range of SNR levels\ntypically encountered in vivo. The estimation precision was further improved by\nfine-tuning the CNN with MRI-based edge-preserving regularization for each DMI\ndataset. The proposed processing method, PReserved Edge ConvolutIonal neural\nnetwork for Sensitivity Enhanced DMI (PRECISE-DMI), was applied to simulation\nstudies and in vivo experiments to evaluate the anticipated improvements in SNR\nand investigate the potential for inaccuracies.\n\nResults: PRECISE-DMI visually improved the metabolic maps of low SNR\ndatasets, and quantitatively provided higher precision than the standard\nFourier reconstruction. Processing of DMI data acquired in rat brain tumor\nmodels resulted in more precise determination of 2H-labeled lactate and\nglutamate + glutamine levels, at increased spatial resolution (from >8 to 2\n$\\mu$L) or shortened scan time (from 32 to 4 min) compared to standard\nacquisitions. However, rigorous SD-bias analyses showed that overuse of the\nedge-preserving regularization can compromise the accuracy of the results.\n\nConclusion: PRECISE-DMI allows a flexible trade-off between enhancing the\nsensitivity of DMI and minimizing the inaccuracies. With typical settings, the\nDMI sensitivity can be improved by 3-fold while retaining the capability to\ndetect local signal variations.",

We assume the data comes from well-separated class-conditional\nlog-concave distributions and allow for a constant fraction of the training\nlabels to be corrupted by an adversary. We show that in this setting, neural\nnetworks exhibit benign overfitting: they can be driven to zero training error,\nperfectly fitting any noisy training labels, and simultaneously achieve minimax\noptimal test error. In contrast to previous work on benign overfitting that\nrequire linear or kernel-based predictors, our analysis holds in a setting\nwhere both the model and learning dynamics are fundamentally nonlinear.",

          "description": "Tens of thousands of simultaneous hypothesis tests are routinely performed in\ngenomic studies to identify differentially expressed genes. However, due to\nunmeasured confounders, many standard statistical approaches may be\nsubstantially biased. This paper investigates the large-scale hypothesis\ntesting problem for multivariate generalized linear models in the presence of\nconfounding effects. Under arbitrary confounding mechanisms, we propose a\nunified statistical estimation and inference framework that harnesses\northogonal structures and integrates linear projections into three key stages.\nIt first leverages multivariate responses to separate marginal and uncorrelated\nconfounding effects, recovering the confounding coefficients' column space.\nSubsequently, latent factors and primary effects are jointly estimated,\nutilizing $\\ell_1$-regularization for sparsity while imposing orthogonality\nonto confounding coefficients. Finally, we incorporate projected and weighted\nbias-correction steps for hypothesis testing. Theoretically, we establish\nvarious effects' identification conditions and non-asymptotic error bounds. We\nshow effective Type-I error control of asymptotic $z$-tests as sample and\nresponse sizes approach infinity. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the\nproposed method controls the false discovery rate by the Benjamini-Hochberg\nprocedure and is more powerful than alternative methods. By comparing\nsingle-cell RNA-seq counts from two groups of samples, we demonstrate the\nsuitability of adjusting confounding effects when significant covariates are\nabsent from the model.",

          "description": "Auditory Attention Detection (AAD) aims to detect target speaker from brain\nsignals in a multi-speaker environment. Although EEG-based AAD methods have\nshown promising results in recent years, current approaches primarily rely on\ntraditional convolutional neural network designed for processing Euclidean data\nlike images. This makes it challenging to handle EEG signals, which possess\nnon-Euclidean characteristics. In order to address this problem, this paper\nproposes a dynamical graph self-distillation (DGSD) approach for AAD, which\ndoes not require speech stimuli as input. Specifically, to effectively\nrepresent the non-Euclidean properties of EEG signals, dynamical graph\nconvolutional networks are applied to represent the graph structure of EEG\nsignals, which can also extract crucial features related to auditory spatial\nattention in EEG signals. In addition, to further improve AAD detection\nperformance, self-distillation, consisting of feature distillation and\nhierarchical distillation strategies at each layer, is integrated. These\nstrategies leverage features and classification results from the deepest\nnetwork layers to guide the learning of shallow layers. Our experiments are\nconducted on two publicly available datasets, KUL and DTU. Under a 1-second\ntime window, we achieve results of 90.0\\% and 79.6\\% accuracy on KUL and DTU,\nrespectively. We compare our DGSD method with competitive baselines, and the\nexperimental results indicate that the detection performance of our proposed\nDGSD method is not only superior to the best reproducible baseline but also\nsignificantly reduces the number of trainable parameters by approximately 100\ntimes.",

The focus of the article is\ntwofold: identify the disparate experimental paradigms used for reliably\neliciting discreet and quantifiable levels of cognitive load and the specific\nnature and representational structure of the commonly used input formulations\nin deep neural networks (DNNs) used for signal classification. The analysis\nrevealed a number of studies using EEG signals in its native representation of\na two-dimensional matrix for offline classification of CWL. However, only a few\nstudies adopted an online or pseudo-online classification strategy for\nreal-time CWL estimation. Further, only a couple of interpretable DNNs and a\nsingle generative model were employed for cognitive load detection till date\nduring this review. More often than not, researchers were using DNNs as\nblack-box type models. In conclusion, DNNs prove to be valuable tools for\nclassifying EEG signals, primarily due to the substantial modeling power\nprovided by the depth of their network architecture. It is further suggested\nthat interpretable and explainable DNN models must be employed for cognitive\nworkload estimation since existing methods are limited in the face of the\nnon-stationary nature of the signal.",

Exploratory research can be\nrestricted if software and hardware are co-evolving, making it even harder to\nstray away from mainstream ideas that work well with popular tooling stacks.\nWhile this friction increasingly impacts the rate of innovation in machine\nlearning, to our knowledge the lack of portability in tooling has not been\nquantified. In this work, we ask: How portable are popular ML software\nframeworks? We conduct a large-scale study of the portability of mainstream ML\nframeworks across different hardware types. Our findings paint an uncomfortable\npicture -- frameworks can lose more than 40% of their key functions when ported\nto other hardware. Worse, even when functions are portable, the slowdown in\ntheir performance can be extreme and render performance untenable.\nCollectively, our results reveal how costly straying from a narrow set of\nhardware-software combinations can be - and suggest that specialization of\nhardware impedes innovation in machine learning research.",

However, to establish ML as a\nreliable tool in clinical practice, adherence to best practices regarding data\nhandling, experimental design, and model evaluation is crucial. This work\nsummarizes and strictly observes such practices to ensure reproducible and\nreliable ML. Specifically, we focus on Alzheimer's Disease (AD) detection,\nwhich serves as a paradigmatic example of challenging problem in healthcare. We\ninvestigate the impact of different data augmentation techniques and model\ncomplexity on the overall performance. We consider MRI data from ADNI dataset\nto address a classification problem employing 3D Convolutional Neural Network\n(CNN). The experiments are designed to compensate for data scarcity and initial\nrandom parameters by utilizing cross-validation and multiple training trials.\nWithin this framework, we train 15 predictive models, considering three\ndifferent data augmentation strategies and five distinct 3D CNN architectures,\neach varying in the number of convolutional layers. Specifically, the\naugmentation strategies are based on affine transformations, such as zoom,\nshift, and rotation, applied concurrently or separately. The combined effect of\ndata augmentation and model complexity leads to a variation in prediction\nperformance up to 10% of accuracy. When affine transformation are applied\nseparately, the model is more accurate, independently from the adopted\narchitecture. For all strategies, the model accuracy followed a concave\nbehavior at increasing number of convolutional layers, peaking at an\nintermediate value of layers.

However, to attain\noptimal performance, the manual selection of prompts is necessary to improve\nalignment between the downstream image distribution and the textual class\ndescriptions. This manual prompt engineering is the major challenge for\ndeploying such models in practice since it requires domain expertise and is\nextremely time-consuming. To avoid non-trivial prompt engineering, recent work\nContext Optimization (CoOp) introduced the concept of prompt learning to the\nvision domain using learnable textual tokens. While CoOp can achieve\nsubstantial improvements over manual prompts, its learned context is worse\ngeneralizable to wider unseen classes within the same dataset. In this work, we\npresent Prompt Learning with Reparameterization Encoder (PRE) - a simple and\nefficient method that enhances the generalization ability of the learnable\nprompt to unseen classes while maintaining the capacity to learn Base classes.\nInstead of directly optimizing the prompts, PRE employs a prompt encoder to\nreparameterize the input prompt embeddings, enhancing the exploration of\ntask-specific knowledge from few-shot samples. Experiments and extensive\nablation studies on 8 benchmarks demonstrate that our approach is an efficient\nmethod for prompt learning. Specifically, PRE achieves a notable enhancement of\n5.60% in average accuracy on New classes and 3% in Harmonic mean compared to\nCoOp in the 16-shot setting, all achieved within a good training time.",

Introducing Distilled Encoding\nBeyond Similarities (DEBS), this paper pioneers an SSL approach that transcends\nmere similarities by integrating dissimilarities among positive pairs. The\nframework is applied to electrocardiogram (ECG) signals, leading to a notable\nenhancement of +10\\% in the detection accuracy of Atrial Fibrillation (AFib)\nacross diverse subjects.

          "description": "The main premise of federated learning (FL) is that machine learning model\nupdates are computed locally to preserve user data privacy. This approach\navoids by design user data to ever leave the perimeter of their device. Once\nthe updates aggregated, the model is broadcast to all nodes in the federation.\nHowever, without proper defenses, compromised nodes can probe the model inside\ntheir local memory in search for adversarial examples, which can lead to\ndangerous real-world scenarios. For instance, in image-based applications,\nadversarial examples consist of images slightly perturbed to the human eye\ngetting misclassified by the local model. These adversarial images are then\nlater presented to a victim node's counterpart model to replay the attack.\nTypical examples harness dissemination strategies such as altered traffic signs\n(patch attacks) no longer recognized by autonomous vehicles or seemingly\nunaltered samples that poison the local dataset of the FL scheme to undermine\nits robustness. Pelta is a novel shielding mechanism leveraging Trusted\nExecution Environments (TEEs) that reduce the ability of attackers to craft\nadversarial samples. Pelta masks inside the TEE the first part of the\nback-propagation chain rule, typically exploited by attackers to craft the\nmalicious samples. We evaluate Pelta on state-of-the-art accurate models using\nthree well-established datasets: CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100 and ImageNet. We show the\neffectiveness of Pelta in mitigating six white-box state-of-the-art adversarial\nattacks, such as Projected Gradient Descent, Momentum Iterative Method, Auto\nProjected Gradient Descent, the Carlini & Wagner attack. In particular, Pelta\nconstitutes the first attempt at defending an ensemble model against the\nSelf-Attention Gradient attack to the best of our knowledge.

          "description": "Unsupervised contrastive learning methods have recently seen significant\nimprovements, particularly through data augmentation strategies that aim to\nproduce robust and generalizable representations.

This dependence often\ncompromises their effectiveness and efficiency. Furthermore, the applicability\nof most existing data augmentation strategies is limited when transitioning to\nother research domains, especially science-related data. This limitation stems\nfrom the paucity of prior knowledge and labeled data available in these\ndomains. To address these challenges, we introduce DiffAug-a novel and\nefficient Diffusion-based data Augmentation technique.

Uniquely, unlike traditional methods, DiffAug\nfirst mines sufficient prior semantic knowledge about the neighborhood. This\nprovides a constraint to guide the diffusion steps, eliminating the need for\nlabels, external data/models, or prior knowledge. Designed as an\narchitecture-agnostic framework, DiffAug provides consistent improvements.\nSpecifically, it improves image classification and clustering accuracy by\n1.6%~4.5%.

          "description": "Decoding visual representations from human brain activity has emerged as a\nthriving research domain, particularly in the context of brain-computer\ninterfaces. Our study presents an innovative method that employs to classify\nand reconstruct images from the ImageNet dataset using electroencephalography\n(EEG) data from subjects that had viewed the images themselves (i.e. \"brain\ndecoding\"). We analyzed EEG recordings from 6 participants, each exposed to 50\nimages spanning 40 unique semantic categories. These EEG readings were\nconverted into spectrograms, which were then used to train a convolutional\nneural network (CNN), integrated with a knowledge distillation procedure based\non a pre-trained Contrastive Language-Image Pre-Training (CLIP)-based image\nclassification teacher network. This strategy allowed our model to attain a\ntop-5 accuracy of 80%, significantly outperforming a standard CNN and various\nRNN-based benchmarks. Additionally, we incorporated an image reconstruction\nmechanism based on pre-trained latent diffusion models, which allowed us to\ngenerate an estimate of the images which had elicited EEG activity. Therefore,\nour architecture not only decodes images from neural activity but also offers a\ncredible image reconstruction from EEG only, paving the way for e.g. swift,\nindividualized feedback experiments. Our research represents a significant step\nforward in connecting neural signals with visual cognition.",

          "description": "Quantile Regression (QR) can be used to estimate aleatoric uncertainty in\ndeep neural networks and can generate prediction intervals. Quantifying\nuncertainty is particularly important in critical applications such as clinical\ndiagnosis, where a realistic assessment of uncertainty is essential in\ndetermining disease status and planning the appropriate treatment. The most\ncommon application of quantile regression models is in cases where the\nparametric likelihood cannot be specified. Although quantile regression is\nquite robust to outlier response observations, it can be sensitive to outlier\ncovariate observations (features). Outlier features can compromise the\nperformance of deep learning regression problems such as style translation,\nimage reconstruction, and deep anomaly detection, potentially leading to\nmisleading conclusions. To address this problem, we propose a robust solution\nfor quantile regression that incorporates concepts from robust divergence. We\ncompare the performance of our proposed method with (i) least trimmed quantile\nregression and (ii) robust regression based on the regularization of\ncase-specific parameters in a simple real dataset in the presence of outlier.\nThese methods have not been applied in a deep learning framework.

          "description": "A major challenge in imaging genetics and similar fields is to link\nhigh-dimensional data in one domain, e.g., genetic data, to high dimensional\ndata in a second domain, e.g., brain imaging data. The standard approach in the\narea are mass univariate analyses across genetic factors and imaging\nphenotypes. That entails executing one genome-wide association study (GWAS) for\neach pre-defined imaging measure. Although this approach has been tremendously\nsuccessful, one shortcoming is that phenotypes must be pre-defined.\nConsequently, effects that are not confined to pre-selected regions of interest\nor that reflect larger brain-wide patterns can easily be missed. In this work\nwe introduce a Partial Least Squares (PLS)-based framework, which we term\nCluster-Bootstrap PLS (CLUB-PLS), that can work with large input dimensions in\nboth domains as well as with large sample sizes. One key factor of the\nframework is to use cluster bootstrap to provide robust statistics for single\ninput features in both domains. We applied CLUB-PLS to investigating the\ngenetic basis of surface area and cortical thickness in a sample of 33,000\nsubjects from the UK Biobank. We found 107 genome-wide significant\nlocus-phenotype pairs that are linked to 386 different genes. We found that a\nvast majority of these loci could be technically validated at a high rate:\nusing classic GWAS or Genome-Wide Inferred Statistics (GWIS) we found that 85\nlocus-phenotype pairs exceeded the genome-wide suggestive (P<1e-05) threshold.",

          "description": "Artistic authoring of 3D environments is a laborious enterprise that also\nrequires skilled content creators. There have been impressive improvements in\nusing machine learning to address different aspects of generating 3D content,\nsuch as generating meshes, arranging geometry, synthesizing textures, etc. In\nthis paper we develop a model to generate Bidirectional Reflectance\nDistribution Functions (BRDFs) from descriptive textual prompts. BRDFs are four\ndimensional probability distributions that characterize the interaction of\nlight with surface materials. They are either represented parametrically, or by\ntabulating the probability density associated with every pair of incident and\noutgoing angles. The former lends itself to artistic editing while the latter\nis used when measuring the appearance of real materials. Numerous works have\nfocused on hypothesizing BRDF models from images of materials. We learn a\nmapping from textual descriptions of materials to parametric BRDFs. Our model\nis first trained using a semi-supervised approach before being tuned via an\nunsupervised scheme. Although our model is general, in this paper we\nspecifically generate parameters for MDL materials, conditioned on natural\nlanguage descriptions, within NVIDIA's Omniverse platform. This enables use\ncases such as real-time text prompts to change materials of objects in 3D\nenvironments such as \"dull plastic\" or \"shiny iron\". Since the output of our\nmodel is a parametric BRDF, rather than an image of the material, it may be\nused to render materials using any shape under arbitrarily specified viewing\nand lighting conditions.",

          "description": "In data-rich domains such as vision, language, and speech, deep learning\nprevails to deliver high-performance task-specific models and can even learn\ngeneral task-agnostic representations for efficient finetuning to downstream\ntasks. However, deep learning in resource-limited domains still faces multiple\nchallenges including (i) limited data, (ii) constrained model development cost,\nand (iii) lack of adequate pre-trained models for effective finetuning. This\npaper provides an overview of model reprogramming to bridge this gap. Model\nreprogramming enables resource-efficient cross-domain machine learning by\nrepurposing and reusing a well-developed pre-trained model from a source domain\nto solve tasks in a target domain without model finetuning, where the source\nand target domains can be vastly different. In many applications, model\nreprogramming outperforms transfer learning and training from scratch. This\npaper elucidates the methodology of model reprogramming, summarizes existing\nuse cases, provides a theoretical explanation of the success of model\nreprogramming, and concludes with a discussion on open-ended research questions\nand opportunities. A list of model reprogramming studies is actively maintained\nand updated at https://github.com/IBM/model-reprogramming.",

          "description": "The discovery of governing equations from data has been an active field of\nresearch for decades. One widely used methodology for this purpose is sparse\nregression for nonlinear dynamics, known as SINDy. Despite several attempts,\nnoisy and scarce data still pose a severe challenge to the success of the SINDy\napproach. In this work, we discuss a robust method to discover nonlinear\ngoverning equations from noisy and scarce data. To do this, we make use of\nneural networks to learn an implicit representation based on measurement data\nso that not only it produces the output in the vicinity of the measurements but\nalso the time-evolution of output can be described by a dynamical system.\nAdditionally, we learn such a dynamic system in the spirit of the SINDy\nframework. Leveraging the implicit representation using neural networks, we\nobtain the derivative information -- required for SINDy -- using an automatic\ndifferentiation tool. To enhance the robustness of our methodology, we further\nincorporate an integral condition on the output of the implicit networks.\nFurthermore, we extend our methodology to handle data collected from multiple\ninitial conditions. We demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed methodology\nto discover governing equations under noisy and scarce data regimes by means of\nseveral examples and compare its performance with existing methods.",

          "description": "Spiking neural networks (SNNs) process time-series data via internal\nevent-driven neural dynamics whose energy consumption depends on the number of\nspikes exchanged between neurons over the course of the input presentation. In\ntypical implementations of an SNN classifier, decisions are produced after the\nentire input sequence has been processed, resulting in latency and energy\nconsumption levels that are fairly uniform across inputs. Recently introduced\ndelay-adaptive SNNs tailor the inference latency -- and, with it, the energy\nconsumption -- to the difficulty of each example, by producing an early\ndecision when the SNN model is sufficiently ``confident''. In this paper, we\nstart by observing that, as an SNN processes input samples, its classification\ndecisions tend to be first under-confident and then over-confident with respect\nto the decision's ground-truth, unknown, test accuracy. This makes it difficult\nto determine a stopping time that ensures a desired level of accuracy. To\naddress this problem, we introduce a novel delay-adaptive SNN-based inference\nmethodology that, wrapping around any pre-trained SNN classifier, provides\nguaranteed reliability for the decisions produced at input-dependent stopping\ntimes. The approach entails minimal added complexity as compared to the\nunderlying SNN, requiring only thresholding and counting operations at run\ntime, and it leverages tools from conformal prediction (CP).",

Addressing\nthis pivotal gap, we introduce the Tree of Uncertain Thoughts (TouT) - a\nreasoning framework tailored for LLMs. Our TouT effectively leverages Monte\nCarlo Dropout to quantify uncertainty scores associated with LLMs' diverse\nlocal responses at these intermediate steps. By marrying this local uncertainty\nquantification with global search algorithms, TouT enhances the model's\nprecision in response generation. We substantiate our approach with rigorous\nexperiments on two demanding planning tasks: Game of 24 and Mini Crosswords.\nThe empirical evidence underscores TouT's superiority over both ToT and\nchain-of-thought prompting methods.",

To achieve this, we propose to learn a dynamics model and check if it is\nequivariant with respect to a fixed type of transformation, namely translations\nin the state space. We then use an entropy regularizer to increase the\nequivariant set and augment the dataset with the resulting transformed samples.\nFinally, we learn a new policy offline based on the augmented dataset, with an\noff-the-shelf offline RL algorithm.

          "description": "Adversarial defenses protect machine learning models from adversarial\nattacks, but are often tailored to one type of model or attack. The lack of\ninformation on unknown potential attacks makes detecting adversarial examples\nchallenging. Additionally, attackers do not need to follow the rules made by\nthe defender. To address this problem, we take inspiration from the concept of\nApplicability Domain in cheminformatics. Cheminformatics models struggle to\nmake accurate predictions because only a limited number of compounds are known\nand available for training. Applicability Domain defines a domain based on the\nknown compounds and rejects any unknown compound that falls outside the domain.\nSimilarly, adversarial examples start as harmless inputs, but can be\nmanipulated to evade reliable classification by moving outside the domain of\nthe classifier. We are the first to identify the similarity between\nApplicability Domain and adversarial detection. Instead of focusing on unknown\nattacks, we focus on what is known, the training data. We propose a simple yet\nrobust triple-stage data-driven framework that checks the input globally and\nlocally, and confirms that they are coherent with the model's output. This\nframework can be applied to any classification model and is not limited to\nspecific attacks. We demonstrate these three stages work as one unit,\neffectively detecting various attacks, even for a white-box scenario.",

In this\npaper, we propose a stealth and practical ViT-specific backdoor attack\n$TrojViT$. Rather than an area-wise trigger used by CNN-specific backdoor\nattacks, TrojViT generates a patch-wise trigger designed to build a Trojan\ncomposed of some vulnerable bits on the parameters of a ViT stored in DRAM\nmemory through patch salience ranking and attention-target loss. TrojViT\nfurther uses minimum-tuned parameter update to reduce the bit number of the\nTrojan. Once the attacker inserts the Trojan into the ViT model by flipping the\nvulnerable bits, the ViT model still produces normal inference accuracy with\nbenign inputs. But when the attacker embeds a trigger into an input, the ViT\nmodel is forced to classify the input to a predefined target class. We show\nthat flipping only few vulnerable bits identified by TrojViT on a ViT model\nusing the well-known RowHammer can transform the model into a backdoored one.\nWe perform extensive experiments of multiple datasets on various ViT models.\nTrojViT can classify $99.64\\%$ of test images to a target class by flipping\n$345$ bits on a ViT for ImageNet.Our codes are available at\nhttps://github.com/mxzheng/TrojViT",

          "description": "The open radio access network (O-RAN) architecture supports intelligent\nnetwork control algorithms as one of its core capabilities. Data-driven\napplications incorporate such algorithms to optimize radio access network (RAN)\nfunctions via RAN intelligent controllers (RICs). Deep reinforcement learning\n(DRL) algorithms are among the main approaches adopted in the O-RAN literature\nto solve dynamic radio resource management problems. However, despite the\nbenefits introduced by the O-RAN RICs, the practical adoption of DRL algorithms\nin real network deployments falls behind. This is primarily due to the slow\nconvergence and unstable performance exhibited by DRL agents upon deployment\nand when facing previously unseen network conditions. In this paper, we address\nthese challenges by proposing transfer learning (TL) as a core component of the\ntraining and deployment workflows for the DRL-based closed-loop control of\nO-RAN functionalities. To this end, we propose and design a hybrid TL-aided\napproach that leverages the advantages of both policy reuse and distillation TL\nmethods to provide safe and accelerated convergence in DRL-based O-RAN slicing.\nWe conduct a thorough experiment that accommodates multiple services, including\nreal VR gaming traffic to reflect practical scenarios of O-RAN slicing. We also\npropose and implement policy reuse and distillation-aided DRL and non-TL-aided\nDRL as three separate baselines. The proposed hybrid approach shows at least:\n7.7% and 20.7% improvements in the average initial reward value and the\npercentage of converged scenarios, and a 64.6% decrease in reward variance\nwhile maintaining fast convergence and enhancing the generalizability compared\nwith the baselines.",

During the training\nphase, our method unmixes the input into the separate encoding spaces of the\nmulti-encoder network and then remixes these representations within the decoder\nfor a reconstruction of the input. Then to perform source inference, we\nintroduce a novel encoding masking technique whereby masking out all but one of\nthe encodings enables the decoder to estimate a source signal. To this end, we\nalso introduce a so-called pathway separation loss that encourages sparsity\nbetween the unmixed encoding spaces throughout the decoder's layers and a\nso-called zero reconstruction loss on the decoder for coherent source\nestimations.

          "description": "In the Variational Autoencoder (VAE), the variational posterior often aligns\nclosely with the prior, which is known as posterior collapse and hinders the\nquality of representation learning. To mitigate this problem, an adjustable\nhyperparameter beta has been introduced in the VAE. This paper presents a\nclosed-form expression to assess the relationship between the beta in VAE, the\ndataset size, the posterior collapse, and the rate-distortion curve by\nanalyzing a minimal VAE in a high-dimensional limit. These results clarify that\na long plateau in the generalization error emerges with a relatively larger\nbeta. As the beta increases, the length of the plateau extends and then becomes\ninfinite beyond a certain beta threshold. This implies that the choice of beta,\nunlike the usual regularization parameters, can induce posterior collapse\nregardless of the dataset size. Thus, beta is a risky parameter that requires\ncareful tuning. Furthermore, considering the dataset-size dependence on the\nrate-distortion curve, a relatively large dataset is required to obtain a\nrate-distortion curve with high rates.

          "description": "Accelerating the learning of Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) from\nexperimental data will speed up the pace of scientific discovery. Previous\nrandomized algorithms exploit sparsity in PDE updates for acceleration. However\nsuch methods are applicable to a limited class of decomposable PDEs, which have\nsparse features in the value domain. We propose Reel, which accelerates the\nlearning of PDEs via random projection and has much broader applicability. Reel\nexploits the sparsity by decomposing dense updates into sparse ones in both the\nvalue and frequency domains. This decomposition enables efficient learning when\nthe source of the updates consists of gradually changing terms across large\nareas (sparse in the frequency domain) in addition to a few rapid updates\nconcentrated in a small set of \"interfacial\" regions (sparse in the value\ndomain). Random projection is then applied to compress the sparse signals for\nlearning. To expand the model applicability, Taylor series expansion is used in\nReel to approximate the nonlinear PDE updates with polynomials in the\ndecomposable form. Theoretically, we derive a constant factor approximation\nbetween the projected loss function and the original one with poly-logarithmic\nnumber of projected dimensions. Experimentally, we provide empirical evidence\nthat our proposed Reel can lead to faster learning of PDE models (70-98%\nreduction in training time when the data is compressed to 1% of its original\nsize) with comparable quality as the non-compressed models.",

Existing methods usually\nresort to analyzing the relationship of various seen classes residing in a\nsample from the dimension of spatial or semantic characteristics, and transfer\nthe learned model to unseen ones. But they ignore the effective integration of\nlocal and global features. That is, in the process of inferring unseen classes,\nglobal features represent the principal direction of the image in the feature\nspace, while local features should maintain uniqueness within a certain range.\nThis integrated neglect will make the model lose its grasp of the main\ncomponents of the image.

We extend JAX automatic differentiation library with an\ninterface to Firedrake finite element library. High-level symbolic\nrepresentation of PDEs allows bypassing differentiating through low-level\npossibly many iterations of the underlying nonlinear solvers. Differentiating\nthrough Firedrake solvers is done using tangent-linear and adjoint equations.\nThis enables the efficient composition of finite element solvers with arbitrary\ndifferentiable programs.

In this work, we introduce EmbodiedGPT, an end-to-end\nmulti-modal foundation model for embodied AI, empowering embodied agents with\nmulti-modal understanding and execution capabilities. To achieve this, we have\nmade the following efforts: (i) We craft a large-scale embodied planning\ndataset, termed EgoCOT. The dataset consists of carefully selected videos from\nthe Ego4D dataset, along with corresponding high-quality language instructions.\nSpecifically, we generate a sequence of sub-goals with the \"Chain of Thoughts\"\nmode for effective embodied planning. (ii) We introduce an efficient training\napproach to EmbodiedGPT for high-quality plan generation, by adapting a 7B\nlarge language model (LLM) to the EgoCOT dataset via prefix tuning. (iii) We\nintroduce a paradigm for extracting task-related features from LLM-generated\nplanning queries to form a closed loop between high-level planning and\nlow-level control. Extensive experiments show the effectiveness of EmbodiedGPT\non embodied tasks, including embodied planning, embodied control, visual\ncaptioning, and visual question answering. Notably, EmbodiedGPT significantly\nenhances the success rate of the embodied control task by extracting more\neffective features.

          "description": "Epilepsy is a prevalent neurological disorder that affects millions of\nindividuals globally, and continuous monitoring coupled with automated seizure\ndetection appears as a necessity for effective patient treatment. To enable\nlong-term care in daily-life conditions, comfortable and smart wearable devices\nwith long battery life are required, which in turn set the demand for\nresource-constrained and energy-efficient computing solutions. In this context,\nthe development of machine learning algorithms for seizure detection faces the\nchallenge of heavily imbalanced datasets. This paper introduces EpiDeNet, a new\nlightweight seizure detection network, and Sensitivity-Specificity Weighted\nCross-Entropy (SSWCE), a new loss function that incorporates sensitivity and\nspecificity, to address the challenge of heavily unbalanced datasets. The\nproposed EpiDeNet-SSWCE approach demonstrates the successful detection of\n91.16% and 92.00% seizure events on two different datasets (CHB-MIT and\nPEDESITE, respectively), with only four EEG channels. A three-window majority\nvoting-based smoothing scheme combined with the SSWCE loss achieves 3x\nreduction of false positives to 1.18 FP/h. EpiDeNet is well suited for\nimplementation on low-power embedded platforms, and we evaluate its performance\non two ARM Cortex-based platforms (M4F/M7) and two parallel ultra-low power\n(PULP) systems (GAP8, GAP9). The most efficient implementation (GAP9) achieves\nan energy efficiency of 40 GMAC/s/W, with an energy consumption per inference\nof only 0.051 mJ at high performance (726.46 MMAC/s), outperforming the best\nARM Cortex-based solutions by approximately 160x in energy efficiency.

          "description": "In many randomized experiments, the treatment effect of the long-term metric\n(i.e. the primary outcome of interest) is often difficult or infeasible to\nmeasure. Such long-term metrics are often slow to react to changes and\nsufficiently noisy they are challenging to faithfully estimate in short-horizon\nexperiments. A common alternative is to measure several short-term proxy\nmetrics in the hope they closely track the long-term metric -- so they can be\nused to effectively guide decision-making in the near-term. We introduce a new\nstatistical framework to both define and construct an optimal proxy metric for\nuse in a homogeneous population of randomized experiments. Our procedure first\nreduces the construction of an optimal proxy metric in a given experiment to a\nportfolio optimization problem which depends on the true latent treatment\neffects and noise level of experiment under consideration. We then denoise the\nobserved treatment effects of the long-term metric and a set of proxies in a\nhistorical corpus of randomized experiments to extract estimates of the latent\ntreatment effects for use in the optimization problem. One key insight derived\nfrom our approach is that the optimal proxy metric for a given experiment is\nnot apriori fixed; rather it should depend on the sample size (or effective\nnoise level) of the randomized experiment for which it is deployed. To\ninstantiate and evaluate our framework, we employ our methodology in a large\ncorpus of randomized experiments from an industrial recommendation system and\nconstruct proxy metrics that perform favorably relative to several baselines.",

          "description": "In consequential domains, it is often impossible to compel individuals to\ntake treatment, so that optimal policy rules are merely suggestions in the\npresence of human non-adherence to treatment recommendations. In these same\ndomains, there may be heterogeneity both in who responds in taking-up\ntreatment, and heterogeneity in treatment efficacy. While optimal treatment\nrules can maximize causal outcomes across the population, access parity\nconstraints or other fairness considerations can be relevant in the case of\nencouragement. For example, in social services, a persistent puzzle is the gap\nin take-up of beneficial services among those who may benefit from them the\nmost. When in addition the decision-maker has distributional preferences over\nboth access and average outcomes, the optimal decision rule changes. We study\ncausal identification, statistical variance-reduced estimation, and robust\nestimation of optimal treatment rules, including under potential violations of\npositivity. We consider fairness constraints such as demographic parity in\ntreatment take-up, and other constraints, via constrained optimization. Our\nframework can be extended to handle algorithmic recommendations under an\noften-reasonable covariate-conditional exclusion restriction, using our\nrobustness checks for lack of positivity in the recommendation.

          "description": "Clustering high-dimensional spatiotemporal data using an unsupervised\napproach is a challenging problem for many data-driven applications. Existing\nstate-of-the-art methods for unsupervised clustering use different similarity\nand distance functions but focus on either spatial or temporal features of the\ndata. Concentrating on joint deep representation learning of spatial and\ntemporal features, we propose Deep Spatiotemporal Clustering (DSC), a novel\nalgorithm for the temporal clustering of high-dimensional spatiotemporal data\nusing an unsupervised deep learning method. Inspired by the U-net architecture,\nDSC utilizes an autoencoder integrating CNN-RNN layers to learn latent\nrepresentations of the spatiotemporal data. DSC also includes a unique layer\nfor cluster assignment on latent representations that uses the Student's\nt-distribution. By optimizing the clustering loss and data reconstruction loss\nsimultaneously, the algorithm gradually improves clustering assignments and the\nnonlinear mapping between low-dimensional latent feature space and\nhigh-dimensional original data space. A multivariate spatiotemporal climate\ndataset is used to evaluate the efficacy of the proposed method. Our extensive\nexperiments show our approach outperforms both conventional and deep\nlearning-based unsupervised clustering algorithms. Additionally, we compared\nthe proposed model with its various variants (CNN encoder, CNN autoencoder,\nCNN-RNN encoder, CNN-RNN autoencoder, etc.) to get insight into using both the\nCNN and RNN layers in the autoencoder, and our proposed technique outperforms\nthese variants in terms of clustering results.",

          "description": "In deep learning, the load data with non-temporal factors are difficult to\nprocess by sequence models. This problem results in insufficient precision of\nthe prediction. Therefore, a short-term load forecasting method based on\nconvolutional neural network (CNN), self-attention encoder-decoder network\n(SAEDN) and residual-refinement (Res) is proposed. In this method, feature\nextraction module is composed of a two-dimensional convolutional neural\nnetwork, which is used to mine the local correlation between data and obtain\nhigh-dimensional data features. The initial load fore-casting module consists\nof a self-attention encoder-decoder network and a feedforward neural network\n(FFN). The module utilizes self-attention mechanisms to encode high-dimensional\nfeatures. This operation can obtain the global correlation between data.\nTherefore, the model is able to retain important information based on the\ncoupling relationship between the data in data mixed with non-time series\nfactors. Then, self-attention decoding is per-formed and the feedforward neural\nnetwork is used to regression initial load. This paper introduces the residual\nmechanism to build the load optimization module. The module generates residual\nload values to optimize the initial load. The simulation results show that the\nproposed load forecasting method has advantages in terms of prediction accuracy\nand prediction stability.",

          "description": "Basecalling is an essential step in nanopore sequencing analysis where the\nraw signals of nanopore sequencers are converted into nucleotide sequences,\ni.e., reads. State-of-the-art basecallers employ complex deep learning models\nto achieve high basecalling accuracy. This makes basecalling\ncomputationally-inefficient and memory-hungry; bottlenecking the entire genome\nanalysis pipeline. However, for many applications, the majority of reads do no\nmatch the reference genome of interest (i.e., target reference) and thus are\ndiscarded in later steps in the genomics pipeline, wasting the basecalling\ncomputation. To overcome this issue, we propose TargetCall, the first\npre-basecalling filter to eliminate the wasted computation in basecalling.\nTargetCall's key idea is to discard reads that will not match the target\nreference (i.e., off-target reads) prior to basecalling. TargetCall consists of\ntwo main components: (1) LightCall, a lightweight neural network basecaller\nthat produces noisy reads; and (2) Similarity Check, which labels each of these\nnoisy reads as on-target or off-target by matching them to the target\nreference. TargetCall aims to filter out all off-target reads before\nbasecalling. The highly-accurate but slow basecalling is performed only on the\nraw signals whose noisy reads are labeled as on-target. Our thorough\nexperimental evaluations using both real and simulated data show that\nTargetCall 1) improves the end-to-end basecalling performance while maintaining\nhigh sensitivity in keeping on-target reads, 2) maintains high accuracy in\ndownstream analysis, 3) precisely filters out up to 94.71% of off-target reads,\nand 4) achieves better performance, throughput, sensitivity, precision, and\ngenerality compared to prior works. We open-source TargetCall at\nhttps://github.com/CMU-SAFARI/TargetCall",

          "description": "Masked Image Modeling (MIM) methods, like Masked Autoencoders (MAE),\nefficiently learn a rich representation of the input. However, for adapting to\ndownstream tasks, they require a sufficient amount of labeled data since their\nrich features code not only objects but also less relevant image background. In\ncontrast, Instance Discrimination (ID) methods focus on objects. In this work,\nwe study how to combine the efficiency and scalability of MIM with the ability\nof ID to perform downstream classification in the absence of large amounts of\nlabeled data. To this end, we introduce Masked Autoencoder Contrastive Tuning\n(MAE-CT), a sequential approach that utilizes the implicit clustering of the\nNearest Neighbor Contrastive Learning (NNCLR) objective to induce abstraction\nin the topmost layers of a pre-trained MAE. MAE-CT tunes the rich features such\nthat they form semantic clusters of objects without using any labels. Notably,\nMAE-CT does not rely on hand-crafted augmentations and frequently achieves its\nbest performances while using only minimal augmentations (crop & flip).\nFurther, MAE-CT is compute efficient as it requires at most 10% overhead\ncompared to MAE re-training. Applied to large and huge Vision Transformer (ViT)\nmodels, MAE-CT excels over previous self-supervised methods trained on ImageNet\nin linear probing, k-NN and low-shot classification accuracy as well as in\nunsupervised clustering accuracy. With ViT-H/16 MAE-CT achieves a new\nstate-of-the-art in linear probing of 82.2%.",

          "description": "Variational algorithms require architectures that naturally constrain the\noptimisation space to run efficiently. In geometric quantum machine learning,\none achieves this by encoding group structure into parameterised quantum\ncircuits to include the symmetries of a problem as an inductive bias. However,\nconstructing such circuits is challenging as a concrete guiding principle has\nyet to emerge. In this paper, we propose the use of spin networks, a form of\ndirected tensor network invariant under a group transformation, to devise SU(2)\nequivariant quantum circuit ans\\\"atze -- circuits possessing spin rotation\nsymmetry. By changing to the basis that block diagonalises SU(2) group action,\nthese networks provide a natural building block for constructing parameterised\nequivariant quantum circuits. We prove that our construction is mathematically\nequivalent to other known constructions, such as those based on twirling and\ngeneralised permutations, but more direct to implement on quantum hardware. The\nefficacy of our constructed circuits is tested by solving the ground state\nproblem of SU(2) symmetric Heisenberg models on the one-dimensional triangular\nlattice and on the Kagome lattice. Our results highlight that our equivariant\ncircuits boost the performance of quantum variational algorithms, indicating\nbroader applicability to other real-world problems.",

          "description": "Meteorological radar reflectivity data (i.e. radar echo) significantly\ninfluences precipitation prediction. It can facilitate accurate and expeditious\nforecasting of short-term heavy rainfall bypassing the need for complex\nNumerical Weather Prediction (NWP) models. In comparison to conventional\nmodels, Deep Learning (DL)-based radar echo extrapolation algorithms exhibit\nhigher effectiveness and efficiency. Nevertheless, the development of reliable\nand generalized echo extrapolation algorithm is impeded by three primary\nchallenges: cumulative error spreading, imprecise representation of sparsely\ndistributed echoes, and inaccurate description of non-stationary motion\nprocesses. To tackle these challenges, this paper proposes a novel radar echo\nextrapolation algorithm called Temporal-Spatial Parallel Transformer, referred\nto as TempEE. TempEE avoids using auto-regression and instead employs a\none-step forward strategy to prevent cumulative error spreading during the\nextrapolation process. Additionally, we propose the incorporation of a\nMulti-level Temporal-Spatial Attention mechanism to improve the algorithm's\ncapability of capturing both global and local information while emphasizing\ntask-related regions, including sparse echo representations, in an efficient\nmanner. Furthermore, the algorithm extracts spatio-temporal representations\nfrom continuous echo images using a parallel encoder to model the\nnon-stationary motion process for echo extrapolation. The superiority of our\nTempEE has been demonstrated in the context of the classic radar echo\nextrapolation task, utilizing a real-world dataset. Extensive experiments have\nfurther validated the efficacy and indispensability of various components\nwithin TempEE.",

We therefore propose a study of the Beran estimator when the\ncensoring indicators are generic random variables and discuss necessary\nconditions for the efficiency of the Beran estimator. From this, we provide a\nnew estimator for the conditional survival function with missing not at random\n(MNAR) censoring indicators based on a conditional copula model for the\nmissingness mechanism.

Such recurrence solving is a bottleneck in current tools: many of the\nrecurrences that arise during the analysis cannot be solved with current\nsolvers, such as Computer Algebra Systems (CASs), so that specific methods for\ndifferent classes of recurrences need to be developed. We address such a\nchallenge by developing a novel, general approach for solving arbitrary,\nconstrained recurrence relations, that uses machine-learning sparse regression\ntechniques to guess a candidate closed-form function, and a combination of an\nSMT-solver and a CAS to check whether such function is actually a solution of\nthe recurrence.

          "description": "Historically, much of machine learning research has focused on the\nperformance of the algorithm alone, but recently more attention has been\nfocused on optimizing joint human-algorithm performance. Here, we analyze a\nspecific type of human-algorithm collaboration where the algorithm has access\nto a set of $n$ items, and presents a subset of size $k$ to the human, who\nselects a final item from among those $k$. This scenario could model content\nrecommendation, route planning, or any type of labeling task. Because both the\nhuman and algorithm have imperfect, noisy information about the true ordering\nof items, the key question is: which value of $k$ maximizes the probability\nthat the best item will be ultimately selected? For $k=1$, performance is\noptimized by the algorithm acting alone, and for $k=n$ it is optimized by the\nhuman acting alone. Surprisingly, we show that for multiple of noise models, it\nis optimal to set $k \\in [2, n-1]$ - that is, there are strict benefits to\ncollaborating, even when the human and algorithm have equal accuracy\nseparately. We demonstrate this theoretically for the Mallows model and\nexperimentally for the Random Utilities models of noisy permutations. However,\nwe show this pattern is reversed when the human is anchored on the algorithm's\npresented ordering - the joint system always has strictly worse performance. We\nextend these results to the case where the human and algorithm differ in their\naccuracy levels, showing that there always exist regimes where a more accurate\nagent would strictly benefit from collaborating with a less accurate one, but\nthese regimes are asymmetric between the human and the algorithm's accuracy.",

          "description": "Ball bearings find widespread use in various manufacturing and mechanical\ndomains, and methods based on machine learning have been widely adopted in the\nfield to monitor wear and spot defects before they lead to failures. Few\nstudies, however, have addressed the problem of censored data, in which failure\nis not observed. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to predict the time\nto failure in ball bearings using survival analysis. First, we analyze bearing\ndata in the frequency domain and annotate when a bearing fails by comparing the\nKullback-Leibler divergence and the standard deviation between its break-in\nfrequency bins and its break-out frequency bins. Second, we train several\nsurvival models to estimate the time to failure based on the annotated data and\ncovariates extracted from the time domain, such as skewness, kurtosis and\nentropy. The models give a probabilistic prediction of risk over time and allow\nus to compare the survival function between groups of bearings. We demonstrate\nour approach on the XJTU and PRONOSTIA datasets. On XJTU, the best result is a\n0.70 concordance-index and 0.21 integrated Brier score. On PRONOSTIA, the best\nis a 0.76 concordance-index and 0.19 integrated Brier score. Our work motivates\nfurther work on incorporating censored data in models for predictive\nmaintenance.",

          "description": "The recipe behind the success of deep learning has been the combination of\nneural networks and gradient-based optimization. Understanding the behavior of\ngradient descent however, and particularly its instability, has lagged behind\nits empirical success. To add to the theoretical tools available to study\ngradient descent we propose the principal flow (PF), a continuous time flow\nthat approximates gradient descent dynamics. To our knowledge, the PF is the\nonly continuous flow that captures the divergent and oscillatory behaviors of\ngradient descent, including escaping local minima and saddle points. Through\nits dependence on the eigendecomposition of the Hessian the PF sheds light on\nthe recently observed edge of stability phenomena in deep learning. Using our\nnew understanding of instability we propose a learning rate adaptation method\nwhich enables us to control the trade-off between training stability and test\nset evaluation performance.",

Existing methods often focus on isolated segments\nof the interaction process and rely on data-driven techniques that may result\nin artifacts. In contrast, our proposed method embraces reinforcement learning\n(RL) and physics simulation to mitigate the limitations of data-driven\napproaches. Through a hierarchical framework, we first learn skill priors for\nboth body and hand movements in a decoupled setting. The generic skill priors\nlearn to decode a latent skill embedding into the motion of the underlying\npart. A high-level policy then controls hand-object interactions in these\npretrained latent spaces, guided by task objectives of grasping and 3D target\ntrajectory following. It is trained using a novel reward function that combines\nan adversarial style term with a task reward, encouraging natural motions while\nfulfilling the task incentives.

Such systems could also be used for the monitoring of the\nhoneybee colonies and for the inspection of their health state, which could\nidentify potentially dangerous states before the situation is critical, or to\nbetter plan periodic bee colony inspections and therefore save significant\ncosts.

In this paper, we propose a\ngeneral estimator that provides a sharp lower bound of the policy value. It can\nbe shown that our estimator contains the recently proposed sharp estimator by\nDorn and Guo (2022) as a special case, and our method enables a novel extension\nof the classical marginal sensitivity model using f-divergence.

Our scheme\nencapsulates two key components: drift estimation and drift regularization.\nSpecifically, LfD first estimates how different the local model is from the\nglobal model (i.e., drift). The local model is then regularized such that it\ndoes not fall in the direction of the estimated drift. In the experiment, we\nevaluate each method through the lens of the five aspects of federated\nlearning, i.e., Generalization, Heterogeneity, Scalability, Forgetting, and\nEfficiency. Comprehensive evaluation results clearly support the superiority of\nLfD in federated learning with Non-IID data.",

          "description": "A growing body of research has focused on the Reinforcement Learning (RL)\nmethods which allow the agent to learn from trial-and-error experiences\ngathered during the interaction with the environment. Recently, offline RL\nbecomes a popular RL paradigm because it saves the interactions with\nenvironments. In offline RL, data providers share large pre-collected datasets,\nand others can train high-quality agents without interacting with the\nenvironments. This paradigm has demonstrated effectiveness in critical tasks\nlike robot control, autonomous driving, etc. However, less attention is paid to\ninvestigating the security threats to the offline RL system. This paper focuses\non backdoor attacks, where some perturbations are added to the data\n(observations) such that given normal observations, the agent takes\nhigh-rewards actions, and low-reward actions on observations injected with\ntriggers. In this paper, we propose Baffle (Backdoor Attack for Offline\nReinforcement Learning), an approach that automatically implants backdoors to\nRL agents by poisoning the offline RL dataset, and evaluate how different\noffline RL algorithms react to this attack. Our experiments conducted on four\ntasks and four offline RL algorithms expose a disquieting fact: none of the\nexisting offline RL algorithms is immune to such a backdoor attack. Baffle\nmodifies $10\\%$ of the datasets for four tasks. Agents trained on the poisoned\ndatasets perform well in normal settings. However, when triggers are presented,\nthe agents' performance decreases drastically by $63.2\\%$, $53.9\\%$, $64.7\\%$,\nand $47.4\\%$ in the four tasks on average. The backdoor still persists after\nfine-tuning poisoned agents on clean datasets. We further show that the\ninserted backdoor is also hard to be detected by a popular defensive method.\nThis paper calls attention to developing more effective protection for the\nopen-source offline RL dataset.",

Service robotics plays a predominant role in this evolution by\ndeploying autonomous agents that can navigate fields while performing tasks\nwithout human intervention, such as monitoring, spraying, and harvesting. To\nexecute these precise actions, mobile robots need a real-time perception system\nthat understands their surroundings and identifies their targets in the wild.\nGeneralizing to new crops and environmental conditions is critical for\npractical applications, as labeled samples are rarely available.

These critical\nsteps are challenging to identify with traditional reinforcement learning (RL)\nmethods that rely on the Bellman equation for credit assignment. Here, we\npresent a new RL algorithm that uses offline contrastive learning to hone in on\ncritical steps. This algorithm, which we call contrastive introspection\n(ConSpec), can be added to any existing RL algorithm. ConSpec learns a set of\nprototypes for the critical steps in a task by a novel contrastive loss and\ndelivers an intrinsic reward when the current state matches one of these\nprototypes. The prototypes in ConSpec provide two key benefits for credit\nassignment: (1) They enable rapid identification of all the critical steps. (2)\nThey do so in a readily interpretable manner, enabling out-of-distribution\ngeneralization when sensory features are altered. Distinct from other\ncontemporary RL approaches to credit assignment, ConSpec takes advantage of the\nfact that it is easier to retrospectively identify the small set of steps that\nsuccess is contingent upon than it is to prospectively predict reward at every\nstep taken in the environment. Altogether, ConSpec improves learning in a\ndiverse set of RL tasks, including both those with explicit, discrete critical\nsteps and those with complex, continuous critical steps.",

The $X, Y \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d \\times d}$ are variables we want to\nlearn. $B \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n \\times d}$ and $b_{j_0,i_0} \\in \\mathbb{R}$ is one\nentry at $j_0$-th row and $i_0$-th column of $B$, $Y_{*,i_0} \\in \\mathbb{R}^d$\nis the $i_0$-column vector of $Y$, and $x \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d^2}$ is the\nvectorization of $X$.\n\nIn a multi-layer LLM network, the matrix $B \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n \\times d}$ can\nbe viewed as the output of a layer, and $A_1= A_2 = A_3 \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n\n\\times d}$ can be viewed as the input of a layer. The matrix version of $x$ can\nbe viewed as $QK^\\top$ and $Y$ can be viewed as $V$. We provide an iterative\ngreedy algorithm to train loss function $L(X,Y)$ up $\\epsilon$ that runs in\n$\\widetilde{O}( ({\\cal T}_{\\mathrm{mat}}(n,n,d) + {\\cal\nT}_{\\mathrm{mat}}(n,d,d) + d^{2\\omega}) \\log(1/\\epsilon) )$ time. Here ${\\cal\nT}_{\\mathrm{mat}}(a,b,c)$ denotes the time of multiplying $a \\times b$ matrix\nanother $b \\times c$ matrix, and $\\omega\\approx 2.37$ denotes the exponent of\nmatrix multiplication.",

The degree of generalization is a realization of the proximity scale\nin the data space. Specifically, the scale is not clear if the dataset is\ncomplicated. Here we consider a network for the distribution estimation of the\ndataset. We show the estimation is unstable and the instability depends on the\ndata density and training duration. We derive the kernel-balanced equation,\nwhich gives a short phenomenological description of the solution. The equation\ntells us the reason for the instability and the mechanism of the scale. The\nnetwork outputs a local average of the dataset as a prediction and the scale of\naveraging is determined along the equation. The scale gradually decreases along\ntraining and finally results in instability in our case.",

Rather than leveraging approximate models with\nbounded uncertainty to find a (robust) invariant set contained in the ROA, we\npropose to learn sets that satisfy a more relaxed notion of containment known\nas recurrence. We define a set to be $\\tau$-recurrent (resp. $k$-recurrent) if\nevery trajectory that starts within the set, returns to it after at most $\\tau$\nseconds (resp. $k$ steps). We show that under mild assumptions a\n$\\tau$-recurrent set containing a stable equilibrium must be a subset of its\nROA. We then leverage this property to develop algorithms that compute inner\napproximations of the ROA using counter-examples of recurrence that are\nobtained by sampling finite-length trajectories. Our algorithms process samples\nsequentially, which allow them to continue being executed even after an initial\noffline training stage. We further provide an upper bound on the number of\ncounter-examples used by the algorithm, and almost sure convergence guarantees.",

          "description": "Recent advances in learning reusable motion priors have demonstrated their\neffectiveness in generating naturalistic behaviors. In this paper, we propose a\nnew learning framework in this paradigm for controlling physics-based\ncharacters with significantly improved motion quality and diversity over\nexisting state-of-the-art methods. The proposed method uses reinforcement\nlearning (RL) to initially track and imitate life-like movements from\nunstructured motion clips using the discrete information bottleneck, as adopted\nin the Vector Quantized Variational AutoEncoder (VQ-VAE). This structure\ncompresses the most relevant information from the motion clips into a compact\nyet informative latent space, i.e., a discrete space over vector quantized\ncodes. By sampling codes in the space from a trained categorical prior\ndistribution, high-quality life-like behaviors can be generated, similar to the\nusage of VQ-VAE in computer vision. Although this prior distribution can be\ntrained with the supervision of the encoder's output, it follows the original\nmotion clip distribution in the dataset and could lead to imbalanced behaviors\nin our setting. To address the issue, we further propose a technique named\nprior shifting to adjust the prior distribution using curiosity-driven RL. The\noutcome distribution is demonstrated to offer sufficient behavioral diversity\nand significantly facilitates upper-level policy learning for downstream tasks.\nWe conduct comprehensive experiments using humanoid characters on two\nchallenging downstream tasks, sword-shield striking and two-player boxing game.\nOur results demonstrate that the proposed framework is capable of controlling\nthe character to perform considerably high-quality movements in terms of\nbehavioral strategies, diversity, and realism.

The cloud types of interest are: clear sky, thin cirrus,\ncirrus, rainy anvil, and convection core.\n\nWe describe multi-step use of Machine Learning and Digital Twin of the\nEarth's atmosphere to derive such a classifier.

A K-means\nclustering over the scientific hidden variables was utilized by human experts\nto generate an automatic labelling of the data - mapping each physical data\npoint to cloud types by scientists informed by mean/centroids of hidden\nvariables of the clusters. Next, classifiers were trained with the inputs of\nthe simulated radiometer data and its corresponding label. The classifiers of a\nrandom decision forest (RDF), support vector machine (SVM), Gaussian na\\\"ive\nbayes, feed forward artificial neural network (ANN), and a convolutional neural\nnetwork (CNN) were trained.

          "description": "Transformers have significantly advanced the field of natural language\nprocessing, but comprehending their internal mechanisms remains a challenge. In\nthis paper, we introduce a novel geometric perspective that elucidates the\ninner mechanisms of transformer operations. Our primary contribution is\nillustrating how layer normalization confines the latent features to a\nhyper-sphere, subsequently enabling attention to mold the semantic\nrepresentation of words on this surface. This geometric viewpoint seamlessly\nconnects established properties such as iterative refinement and contextual\nembeddings. We validate our insights by probing a pre-trained 124M parameter\nGPT-2 model. Our findings reveal clear query-key attention patterns in early\nlayers and build upon prior observations regarding the subject-specific nature\nof attention heads at deeper layers. Harnessing these geometric insights, we\npresent an intuitive understanding of transformers, depicting them as processes\nthat model the trajectory of word particles along the hyper-sphere.",

          "description": "Data is the cornerstone of deep learning. This paper reveals that the\nrecently developed Diffusion Model is a scalable data engine for object\ndetection. Existing methods for scaling up detection-oriented data often\nrequire manual collection or generative models to obtain target images,\nfollowed by data augmentation and labeling to produce training pairs, which are\ncostly, complex, or lacking diversity. To address these issues, we\npresentDiffusionEngine (DE), a data scaling-up engine that provides\nhigh-quality detection-oriented training pairs in a single stage. DE consists\nof a pre-trained diffusion model and an effective Detection-Adapter,\ncontributing to generating scalable, diverse and generalizable detection data\nin a plug-and-play manner. Detection-Adapter is learned to align the implicit\nsemantic and location knowledge in off-the-shelf diffusion models with\ndetection-aware signals to make better bounding-box predictions. Additionally,\nwe contribute two datasets, i.e., COCO-DE and VOC-DE, to scale up existing\ndetection benchmarks for facilitating follow-up research. Extensive experiments\ndemonstrate that data scaling-up via DE can achieve significant improvements in\ndiverse scenarios, such as various detection algorithms, self-supervised\npre-training, data-sparse, label-scarce, cross-domain, and semi-supervised\nlearning. For example, when using DE with a DINO-based adapter to scale up\ndata, mAP is improved by 3.1% on COCO, 7.6% on VOC, and 11.5% on Clipart.",

In order to make better use of the power of\ngraph model, some researchs also combine split learning(SL). However, there are\nstill several issues left unattended: 1) Clients might not be able to access\nthe server during inference phase; 2) The graph of clients designed manually in\nthe server model may not reveal the proper relationship between clients. This\npaper proposes a new GNN-oriented split federated learning method, named node\n{\\bfseries M}asking and {\\bfseries M}ulti-granularity {\\bfseries M}essage\npassing-based Federated Graph Model (M$^3$FGM) for the above issues. For the\nfirst issue, the server model of M$^3$FGM employs a MaskNode layer to simulate\nthe case of clients being offline. We also redesign the decoder of the client\nmodel using a dual-sub-decoders structure so that each client model can use its\nlocal data to predict independently when offline. As for the second issue, a\nnew GNN layer named Multi-Granularity Message Passing (MGMP) layer enables each\nclient node to perceive global and local information. We conducted extensive\nexperiments in two different scenarios on two real traffic datasets.

To address this,\nwe propose using link local differential privacy over decentralized nodes,\nenabling collaboration with an untrusted server to train GNNs without revealing\nthe existence of any link. Our approach spends the privacy budget separately on\nlinks and degrees of the graph for the server to better denoise the graph\ntopology using Bayesian estimation, alleviating the negative impact of LDP on\nthe accuracy of the trained GNNs. We bound the mean absolute error of the\ninferred link probabilities against the ground truth graph topology. We then\npropose two variants of our LDP mechanism complementing each other in different\nprivacy settings, one of which estimates fewer links under lower privacy\nbudgets to avoid false positive link estimates when the uncertainty is high,\nwhile the other utilizes more information and performs better given relatively\nhigher privacy budgets.

          "description": "The atmosphere affects humans in a multitude of ways, from loss of life due\nto adverse weather effects to long-term social and economic impacts on\nsocieties. Computer simulations of atmospheric dynamics are, therefore, of\ngreat importance for the well-being of our and future generations. Here, we\npropose AtmoRep, a novel, task-independent stochastic computer model of\natmospheric dynamics that can provide skillful results for a wide range of\napplications. AtmoRep uses large-scale representation learning from artificial\nintelligence to determine a general description of the highly complex,\nstochastic dynamics of the atmosphere from the best available estimate of the\nsystem's historical trajectory as constrained by observations. This is enabled\nby a novel self-supervised learning objective and a unique ensemble that\nsamples from the stochastic model with a variability informed by the one in the\nhistorical record. The task-independent nature of AtmoRep enables skillful\nresults for a diverse set of applications without specifically training for\nthem and we demonstrate this for nowcasting, temporal interpolation, model\ncorrection, and counterfactuals. We also show that AtmoRep can be improved with\nadditional data, for example radar observations, and that it can be extended to\ntasks such as downscaling.

          "description": "With the increasing importance of data privacy protection, various\nprivacy-preserving machine learning methods have been proposed. In the\nclustering domain, various algorithms with a federated learning framework\n(i.e., federated clustering) have been actively studied and showed high\nclustering performance while preserving data privacy. However, most of the base\nclusterers (i.e., clustering algorithms) used in existing federated clustering\nalgorithms need to specify the number of clusters in advance. These algorithms,\ntherefore, are unable to deal with data whose distributions are unknown or\ncontinually changing. To tackle this problem, this paper proposes a\nprivacy-preserving continual federated clustering algorithm. In the proposed\nalgorithm, an adaptive resonance theory-based clustering algorithm capable of\ncontinual learning is used as a base clusterer. Therefore, the proposed\nalgorithm inherits the ability of continual learning. Experimental results with\nsynthetic and real-world datasets show that the proposed algorithm has superior\nclustering performance to state-of-the-art federated clustering algorithms\nwhile realizing data privacy protection and continual learning ability.

We aim to shed light on this problem by comparing\ninitialization on ImageNet and RadImageNet on seven medical classification\ntasks. Our work includes a replication study, which yields results contrary to\npreviously published findings. In our experiments, ResNet50 models pre-trained\non ImageNet tend to outperform those trained on RadImageNet. To gain further\ninsights, we investigate the learned representations using Canonical\nCorrelation Analysis (CCA) and compare the predictions of the different models.\nOur results indicate that, contrary to intuition, ImageNet and RadImageNet may\nconverge to distinct intermediate representations, which appear to diverge\nfurther during fine-tuning. Despite these distinct representations, the\npredictions of the models remain similar. Our findings show that the similarity\nbetween networks before and after fine-tuning does not correlate with\nperformance gains, suggesting that the advantages of transfer learning might\nnot solely originate from the reuse of features in the early layers of a\nconvolutional neural network.",

There are many\ndifferent clustering quality measures, which try to provide a general measure\nto validate clustering results. A very popular measure is the Silhouette. We\ndiscuss the efficient medoid-based variant of the Silhouette, perform a\ntheoretical analysis of its properties, provide two fast versions for the\ndirect optimization, and discuss the use to choose the optimal number of\nclusters. We combine ideas from the original Silhouette with the well-known PAM\nalgorithm and its latest improvements FasterPAM. One of the versions guarantees\nequal results to the original variant and provides a run speedup of $O(k^2)$.\nIn experiments on real data with 30000 samples and $k$=100, we observed a\n10464$\\times$ speedup compared to the original PAMMEDSIL algorithm.\nAdditionally, we provide a variant to choose the optimal number of clusters\ndirectly.",

          "description": "Typical technique in knowledge distillation (KD) is regularizing the learning\nof a limited capacity model (student) by pushing its responses to match a\npowerful model's (teacher). Albeit useful especially in the penultimate layer\nand beyond, its action on student's feature transform is rather implicit,\nlimiting its practice in the intermediate layers. To explicitly embed the\nteacher's knowledge in feature transform, we propose a learnable KD layer for\nthe student which improves KD with two distinct abilities: i) learning how to\nleverage the teacher's knowledge, enabling to discard nuisance information, and\nii) feeding forward the transferred knowledge deeper. Thus, the student enjoys\nthe teacher's knowledge during the inference besides training. Formally, we\nrepurpose 1x1-BN-ReLU-1x1 convolution block to assign a semantic vector to each\nlocal region according to the template (supervised by the teacher) that the\ncorresponding region of the student matches. To facilitate template learning in\nthe intermediate layers, we propose a novel form of supervision based on the\nteacher's decisions. Through rigorous experimentation, we demonstrate the\neffectiveness of our approach on 3 popular classification benchmarks. Code is\navailable at: https://github.com/adagorgun/letKD-framework",

In 1) LLMs can\naid in generating training data, extracting entities and synonyms,\nlocalization, and persona design. In 2) LLMs can assist in contextualization,\nintent classification to prevent conversational breakdown and handle\nout-of-scope questions, auto-correcting utterances, rephrasing responses,\nformulating disambiguation questions, summarization, and enabling closed\nquestion-answering capabilities. We conducted informal experiments with GPT-4\nin the private banking domain to demonstrate the scenarios above with a\npractical example. Companies may be hesitant to replace their pipeline-based\nagents with LLMs entirely due to privacy concerns and the need for deep\nintegration within their existing ecosystems.

          "description": "Decisions made by machine learning models may have lasting impacts over time,\nmaking long-term fairness a crucial consideration. It has been shown that when\nignoring the long-term effect, naively imposing fairness criterion in static\nsettings can actually exacerbate bias over time. To explicitly address biases\nin sequential decision-making, recent works formulate long-term fairness\nnotions in Markov Decision Process (MDP) framework. They define the long-term\nbias to be the sum of static bias over each time step. However, we demonstrate\nthat naively summing up the step-wise bias can cause a false sense of fairness\nsince it fails to consider the importance difference of different time steps\nduring transition. In this work, we introduce a long-term fairness notion\ncalled Equal Long-term Benefit Rate (ELBERT), which explicitly considers\nvarying temporal importance and adapts static fairness principles to the\nsequential setting. Moreover, we show that the policy gradient of Long-term\nBenefit Rate can be analytically reduced to standard policy gradient. This\nmakes standard policy optimization methods applicable for reducing the bias,\nleading to our proposed bias mitigation method ELBERT-PO. Experiments on three\nsequential decision making environments show that ELBERT-PO significantly\nreduces bias and maintains high utility.

The issue is that using small ranks increases the risk of significant\naccuracy drop after decomposition. In this paper, we propose two techniques for\naccelerating low rank decomposed models without requiring to use small ranks\nfor decomposition. These methods include rank optimization and sequential\nfreezing of decomposed layers. We perform experiments on both convolutional and\ntransformer-based models.

Here, we show how deep learning can be powerfully\nleveraged to address Occam's razor.

Timely discernment of\nsuch cognitive distortions and suicidal risks is crucial to effectively\nintervene and potentially avert dire circumstances.

Using supervised\nlearning as a baseline, we examined and contrasted the efficacy of large\nlanguage models via three distinct strategies: zero-shot, few-shot, and\nfine-tuning. Our findings revealed a discernible performance gap between the\nlarge language models and traditional supervised learning approaches, primarily\nattributed to the models' inability to fully grasp subtle categories. Notably,\nwhile GPT-4 outperforms its counterparts in multiple scenarios, GPT-3.5 shows\nsignificant enhancement in suicide risk classification after fine-tuning.

Automated PWMLs segmentation from infant brain MR images is\nchallenging, considering that the lesions are typically small and low-contrast,\nand the number of lesions may dramatically change across subjects. Existing\nlearning-based methods directly apply general network architectures to this\nchallenging task, which may fail to capture detailed positional information of\nPWMLs, potentially leading to severe under-segmentations.

          "description": "Early detection of cardiac dysfunction through routine screening is vital for\ndiagnosing cardiovascular diseases. An important metric of cardiac function is\nthe left ventricular ejection fraction (EF), where lower EF is associated with\ncardiomyopathy. Echocardiography is a popular diagnostic tool in cardiology,\nwith ultrasound being a low-cost, real-time, and non-ionizing technology.\nHowever, human assessment of echocardiograms for calculating EF is\ntime-consuming and expertise-demanding, raising the need for an automated\napproach. In this work, we propose using the M(otion)-mode of echocardiograms\nfor estimating the EF and classifying cardiomyopathy. We generate multiple\nartificial M-mode images from a single echocardiogram and combine them using\noff-the-shelf model architectures. Additionally, we extend contrastive learning\n(CL) to cardiac imaging to learn meaningful representations from exploiting\nstructures in unlabeled data allowing the model to achieve high accuracy, even\nwith limited annotations. Our experiments show that the supervised setting\nconverges with only ten modes and is comparable to the baseline method while\nbypassing its cumbersome training process and being computationally much more\nefficient. Furthermore, CL using M-mode images is helpful for limited data\nscenarios, such as having labels for only 200 patients, which is common in\nmedical applications.",

          "description": "Dexterous manipulation tasks involving contact-rich interactions pose a\nsignificant challenge for both model-based control systems and imitation\nlearning algorithms. The complexity arises from the need for multi-fingered\nrobotic hands to dynamically establish and break contacts, balance\nnon-prehensile forces, and control large degrees of freedom. Reinforcement\nlearning (RL) offers a promising approach due to its general applicability and\ncapacity to autonomously acquire optimal manipulation strategies. However, its\nreal-world application is often hindered by the necessity to generate a large\nnumber of samples, reset the environment, and obtain reward signals. In this\nwork, we introduce an efficient system for learning dexterous manipulation\nskills with RL to alleviate these challenges. The main idea of our approach is\nthe integration of recent advances in sample-efficient RL and replay buffer\nbootstrapping. This combination allows us to utilize data from different tasks\nor objects as a starting point for training new tasks, significantly improving\nlearning efficiency. Additionally, our system completes the real-world training\ncycle by incorporating learned resets via an imitation-based pickup policy as\nwell as learned reward functions, eliminating the need for manual resets and\nreward engineering. We demonstrate the benefits of reusing past data as replay\nbuffer initialization for new tasks, for instance, the fast acquisition of\nintricate manipulation skills in the real world on a four-fingered robotic\nhand.

          "description": "Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) has become increasingly significant\nfor improving the interpretability and trustworthiness of machine learning\nmodels. While saliency maps have stolen the show for the last few years in the\nXAI field, their ability to reflect models' internal processes has been\nquestioned. Although less in the spotlight, example-based XAI methods have\ncontinued to improve. It encompasses methods that use examples as explanations\nfor a machine learning model's predictions. This aligns with the psychological\nmechanisms of human reasoning and makes example-based explanations natural and\nintuitive for users to understand. Indeed, humans learn and reason by forming\nmental representations of concepts based on examples.\n\nThis paper provides an overview of the state-of-the-art in natural\nexample-based XAI, describing the pros and cons of each approach. A \"natural\"\nexample simply means that it is directly drawn from the training data without\ninvolving any generative process. The exclusion of methods that require\ngenerating examples is justified by the need for plausibility which is in some\nregards required to gain a user's trust. Consequently, this paper will explore\nthe following family of methods: similar examples, counterfactual and\nsemi-factual, influential instances, prototypes, and concepts. In particular,\nit will compare their semantic definition, their cognitive impact, and added\nvalues. We hope it will encourage and facilitate future work on natural\nexample-based XAI.",

          "description": "Adversarial examples, inputs designed to induce worst-case behavior in\nmachine learning models, have been extensively studied over the past decade.\nYet, our understanding of this phenomenon stems from a rather fragmented pool\nof knowledge; at present, there are a handful of attacks, each with disparate\nassumptions in threat models and incomparable definitions of optimality. In\nthis paper, we propose a systematic approach to characterize worst-case (i.e.,\noptimal) adversaries. We first introduce an extensible decomposition of attacks\nin adversarial machine learning by atomizing attack components into surfaces\nand travelers. With our decomposition, we enumerate over components to create\n576 attacks (568 of which were previously unexplored). Next, we propose the\nPareto Ensemble Attack (PEA): a theoretical attack that upper-bounds attack\nperformance. With our new attacks, we measure performance relative to the PEA\non: both robust and non-robust models, seven datasets, and three extended\nlp-based threat models incorporating compute costs, formalizing the Space of\nAdversarial Strategies. From our evaluation we find that attack performance to\nbe highly contextual: the domain, model robustness, and threat model can have a\nprofound influence on attack efficacy. Our investigation suggests that future\nstudies measuring the security of machine learning should: (1) be\ncontextualized to the domain & threat models, and (2) go beyond the handful of\nknown attacks used today.",

Despite\nthis importance, due to the limitations of urban sensing techniques, the data\nquality from most sources is inadequate for monitoring crowd flow at each POI.\nThis renders the inference of accurate crowd flow from low-quality data a\ncritical and challenging task. The complexity is heightened by three key\nfactors: 1) \\emph{The scarcity and rarity of labeled data}, 2) \\emph{The\nintricate spatio-temporal dependencies among POIs}, and 3) \\emph{The myriad\ncorrelations between precise crowd flow and GPS reports}.\n\nTo address these challenges, we recast the crowd flow inference problem as a\nself-supervised attributed graph representation learning task and introduce a\nnovel \\underline{C}ontrastive \\underline{S}elf-learning framework for\n\\underline{S}patio-\\underline{T}emporal data (\\model). Our approach initiates\nwith the construction of a spatial adjacency graph founded on the POIs and\ntheir respective distances. We then employ a contrastive learning technique to\nexploit large volumes of unlabeled spatio-temporal data. We adopt a swapped\nprediction approach to anticipate the representation of the target subgraph\nfrom similar instances. Following the pre-training phase, the model is\nfine-tuned with accurate crowd flow data.

In many applications classification\nalone is not enough, we often need to classify but also understand what the\nmodel learns (e.g., why was a prediction given, based on what information in\nthe data). The main focus of this paper is on analysing and evaluating\nexplanation methods tailored to Multivariate Time Series Classification (MTSC).\nWe focus on saliency-based explanation methods that can point out the most\nrelevant channels and time series points for the classification decision. We\nanalyse two popular and accurate multivariate time series classifiers, ROCKET\nand dResNet, as well as two popular explanation methods, SHAP and dCAM. We\nstudy these methods on 3 synthetic datasets and 2 real-world datasets and\nprovide a quantitative and qualitative analysis of the explanations provided.\nWe find that flattening the multivariate datasets by concatenating the channels\nworks as well as using multivariate classifiers directly and adaptations of\nSHAP for MTSC work quite well. Additionally, we also find that the popular\nsynthetic datasets we used are not suitable for time series analysis.",

          "description": "Employing a forward diffusion chain to gradually map the data to a noise\ndistribution, diffusion-based generative models learn how to generate the data\nby inferring a reverse diffusion chain. However, this approach is slow and\ncostly because it needs many forward and reverse steps. We propose a faster and\ncheaper approach that adds noise not until the data become pure random noise,\nbut until they reach a hidden noisy data distribution that we can confidently\nlearn. Then, we use fewer reverse steps to generate data by starting from this\nhidden distribution that is made similar to the noisy data. We reveal that the\nproposed model can be cast as an adversarial auto-encoder empowered by both the\ndiffusion process and a learnable implicit prior. Experimental results show\neven with a significantly smaller number of reverse diffusion steps, the\nproposed truncated diffusion probabilistic models can provide consistent\nimprovements over the non-truncated ones in terms of performance in both\nunconditional and text-guided image generations.",

          "description": "Bootstrapping is behind much of the successes of deep Reinforcement Learning.\nHowever, learning the value function via bootstrapping often leads to unstable\ntraining due to fast-changing target values. Target Networks are employed to\nstabilize training by using an additional set of lagging parameters to estimate\nthe target values. Despite the popularity of Target Networks, their effect on\nthe optimization is still misunderstood. In this work, we show that they act as\nan implicit regularizer which can be beneficial in some cases, but also have\ndisadvantages such as being inflexible and can result in instabilities, even\nwhen vanilla TD(0) converges. To overcome these issues, we propose an explicit\nFunctional Regularization alternative that is flexible and a convex regularizer\nin function space and we theoretically study its convergence. We conduct an\nexperimental study across a range of environments, discount factors, and\noff-policiness data collections to investigate the effectiveness of the\nregularization induced by Target Networks and Functional Regularization in\nterms of performance, accuracy, and stability. Our findings emphasize that\nFunctional Regularization can be used as a drop-in replacement for Target\nNetworks and result in performance improvement.

          "description": "We present ArtiGrasp, a novel method to synthesize bi-manual hand-object\ninteractions that include grasping and articulation. This task is challenging\ndue to the diversity of the global wrist motions and the precise finger control\nthat are necessary to articulate objects. ArtiGrasp leverages reinforcement\nlearning and physics simulations to train a policy that controls the global and\nlocal hand pose. Our framework unifies grasping and articulation within a\nsingle policy guided by a single hand pose reference. Moreover, to facilitate\nthe training of the precise finger control required for articulation, we\npresent a learning curriculum with increasing difficulty. It starts with\nsingle-hand manipulation of stationary objects and continues with multi-agent\ntraining including both hands and non-stationary objects. To evaluate our\nmethod, we introduce Dynamic Object Grasping and Articulation, a task that\ninvolves bringing an object into a target articulated pose. This task requires\ngrasping, relocation, and articulation. We show our method's efficacy towards\nthis task. We further demonstrate that our method can generate motions with\nnoisy hand-object pose estimates from an off-the-shelf image-based regressor.",

          "description": "Performance metrics for medical image segmentation models are used to measure\nthe agreement between the reference annotation and the predicted segmentation.\nUsually, overlap metrics, such as the Dice, are used as a metric to evaluate\nthe performance of these models in order for results to be comparable. However,\nthere is a mismatch between the distributions of cases and difficulty level of\nsegmentation tasks in public data sets compared to clinical practice. Common\nmetrics fail to measure the impact of this mismatch, especially for clinical\ndata sets that include low signal pathologies, a difficult segmentation task,\nand uncertain, small, or empty reference annotations. This limitation may\nresult in ineffective research of machine learning practitioners in designing\nand optimizing models. Dimensions of evaluating clinical value include\nconsideration of the uncertainty of reference annotations, independence from\nreference annotation volume size, and evaluation of classification of empty\nreference annotations. We study how uncertain, small, and empty reference\nannotations influence the value of metrics for medical image segmentation on an\nin-house data set regardless of the model. We examine metrics behavior on the\npredictions of a standard deep learning framework in order to identify metrics\nwith clinical value. We compare to a public benchmark data set (BraTS 2019)\nwith a high-signal pathology and certain, larger, and no empty reference\nannotations. We may show machine learning practitioners, how uncertain, small,\nor empty reference annotations require a rethinking of the evaluation and\noptimizing procedures.

          "description": "Learning for Demonstration (LfD) enables robots to acquire new skills by\nimitating expert demonstrations, allowing users to communicate their\ninstructions in an intuitive manner. Recent progress in LfD often relies on\nkinesthetic teaching or teleoperation as the medium for users to specify the\ndemonstrations. Kinesthetic teaching requires physical handling of the robot,\nwhile teleoperation demands proficiency with additional hardware. This paper\nintroduces an alternative paradigm for LfD called Diagrammatic Teaching.\nDiagrammatic Teaching aims to teach robots novel skills by prompting the user\nto sketch out demonstration trajectories on 2D images of the scene, these are\nthen synthesised as a generative model of motion trajectories in 3D task space.\nAdditionally, we present the Ray-tracing Probabilistic Trajectory Learning\n(RPTL) framework for Diagrammatic Teaching. RPTL extracts time-varying\nprobability densities from the 2D sketches, applies ray-tracing to find\ncorresponding regions in 3D Cartesian space, and fits a probabilistic model of\nmotion trajectories to these regions. New motion trajectories, which mimic\nthose sketched by the user, can then be generated from the probabilistic model.\nWe empirically validate our framework both in simulation and on real robots,\nwhich include a fixed-base manipulator and a quadruped-mounted manipulator.",

          "description": "As an essential component part of the Intelligent Transportation System\n(ITS), the Internet of Vehicles (IoV) plays a vital role in alleviating traffic\nissues. Object detection is one of the key technologies in the IoV, which has\nbeen widely used to provide traffic management services by analyzing timely and\nsensitive vehicle-related information. However, the current object detection\nmethods are mostly based on centralized deep training, that is, the sensitive\ndata obtained by edge devices need to be uploaded to the server, which raises\nprivacy concerns. To mitigate such privacy leakage, we first propose a\nfederated learning-based framework, where well-trained local models are shared\nin the central server. However, since edge devices usually have limited\ncomputing power, plus a strict requirement of low latency in IoVs, we further\npropose a sparse training process on edge devices, which can effectively\nlighten the model, and ensure its training efficiency on edge devices, thereby\nreducing communication overheads. In addition, due to the diverse computing\ncapabilities and dynamic environment, different sparsity rates are applied to\nedge devices. To further guarantee the performance, we propose, FedWeg, an\nimproved aggregation scheme based on FedAvg, which is designed by the inverse\nratio of sparsity rates. Experiments on the real-life dataset using YOLO show\nthat the proposed scheme can achieve the required object detection rate while\nsaving considerable communication costs.",

          "description": "Instruction-tuned Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently showcased\nremarkable ability to generate fitting responses to natural language\ninstructions. However, an open research question concerns the inherent biases\nof trained models and their responses. For instance, if the data used to tune\nan LLM is dominantly written by persons with a specific political bias, we\nmight expect generated answers to share this bias. Current research work seeks\nto de-bias such models, or suppress potentially biased answers. With this\ndemonstration, we take a different view on biases in instruction-tuning: Rather\nthan aiming to suppress them, we aim to make them explicit and transparent. To\nthis end, we present OpinionGPT, a web demo in which users can ask questions\nand select all biases they wish to investigate. The demo will answer this\nquestion using a model fine-tuned on text representing each of the selected\nbiases, allowing side-by-side comparison. To train the underlying model, we\nidentified 11 different biases (political, geographic, gender, age) and derived\nan instruction-tuning corpus in which each answer was written by members of one\nof these demographics.

Existing works mainly focus on language\nand image instruction tuning, different from which, our ImageBind-LLM can\nrespond to multi-modality conditions, including audio, 3D point clouds, video,\nand their embedding-space arithmetic by only image-text alignment training.\nDuring training, we adopt a learnable bind network to align the embedding space\nbetween LLaMA and ImageBind's image encoder. Then, the image features\ntransformed by the bind network are added to word tokens of all layers in\nLLaMA, which progressively injects visual instructions via an attention-free\nand zero-initialized gating mechanism. Aided by the joint embedding of\nImageBind, the simple image-text training enables our model to exhibit superior\nmulti-modality instruction-following capabilities. During inference, the\nmulti-modality inputs are fed into the corresponding ImageBind encoders, and\nprocessed by a proposed visual cache model for further cross-modal embedding\nenhancement. The training-free cache model retrieves from three million image\nfeatures extracted by ImageBind, which effectively mitigates the\ntraining-inference modality discrepancy.

          "description": "Hyperparameter optimization (HPO) is important to leverage the full potential\nof machine learning (ML). In practice, users are often interested in\nmulti-objective (MO) problems, i.e., optimizing potentially conflicting\nobjectives, like accuracy and energy consumption. To tackle this, the vast\nmajority of MO-ML algorithms return a Pareto front of non-dominated machine\nlearning models to the user. Optimizing the hyperparameters of such algorithms\nis non-trivial as evaluating a hyperparameter configuration entails evaluating\nthe quality of the resulting Pareto front. In literature, there are known\nindicators that assess the quality of a Pareto front (e.g., hypervolume, R2) by\nquantifying different properties (e.g., volume, proximity to a reference\npoint). However, choosing the indicator that leads to the desired Pareto front\nmight be a hard task for a user. In this paper, we propose a human-centered\ninteractive HPO approach tailored towards multi-objective ML leveraging\npreference learning to extract desiderata from users that guide the\noptimization. Instead of relying on the user guessing the most suitable\nindicator for their needs, our approach automatically learns an appropriate\nindicator. Concretely, we leverage pairwise comparisons of distinct Pareto\nfronts to learn such an appropriate quality indicator. Then, we optimize the\nhyperparameters of the underlying MO-ML algorithm towards this learned\nindicator using a state-of-the-art HPO approach. In an experimental study\ntargeting the environmental impact of ML, we demonstrate that our approach\nleads to substantially better Pareto fronts compared to optimizing based on a\nwrong indicator pre-selected by the user, and performs comparable in the case\nof an advanced user knowing which indicator to pick.",

          "description": "The Lipschitz bound, a technique from robust statistics, can limit the\nmaximum changes in the output concerning the input, taking into account\nassociated irrelevant biased factors. It is an efficient and provable method\nfor examining the output stability of machine learning models without incurring\nadditional computation costs. Recently, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), which\noperate on non-Euclidean data, have gained significant attention. However, no\nprevious research has investigated the GNN Lipschitz bounds to shed light on\nstabilizing model outputs, especially when working on non-Euclidean data with\ninherent biases. Given the inherent biases in common graph data used for GNN\ntraining, it poses a serious challenge to constraining the GNN output\nperturbations induced by input biases, thereby safeguarding fairness during\ntraining. Recently, despite the Lipschitz constant's use in controlling the\nstability of Euclideanneural networks, the calculation of the precise Lipschitz\nconstant remains elusive for non-Euclidean neural networks like GNNs,\nespecially within fairness contexts. To narrow this gap, we begin with the\ngeneral GNNs operating on an attributed graph, and formulate a Lipschitz bound\nto limit the changes in the output regarding biases associated with the input.\nAdditionally, we theoretically analyze how the Lipschitz constant of a GNN\nmodel could constrain the output perturbations induced by biases learned from\ndata for fairness training. We experimentally validate the Lipschitz bound's\neffectiveness in limiting biases of the model output. Finally, from a training\ndynamics perspective, we demonstrate why the theoretical Lipschitz bound can\neffectively guide the GNN training to better trade-off between accuracy and\nfairness.",

State-of-the-art PU learning methods have\nresulted in the development of various risk estimators, yet they neglect the\ndifferences among distinct populations. To address this issue, we present a\nnovel Positive-Unlabeled Learning Tree (PUtree) algorithm. PUtree is designed\nto take into account communities such as different age or income brackets, in\ntasks of chronic disease prediction. We propose a novel approach for binary\ndecision-making, which hierarchically builds community-based PU models and then\naggregates their deliverables. Our method can explicate each PU model on the\ntree for the optimized non-leaf PU node splitting. Furthermore, a mask-recovery\ndata augmentation strategy enables sufficient training of the model in\nindividual communities. Additionally, the proposed approach includes an\nadversarial PU risk estimator to capture hierarchical PU-relationships, and a\nmodel fusion network that integrates data from each tree path, resulting in\nrobust binary classification results.

However, in times of threats to\nits supply, it is also a critical element that guarantees the supply of this\nraw material to meet individual consumers' needs, ensuring society's energy\nsecurity. This article introduces a novel multistep ahead forecasting of\nnatural gas consumption with change point detection integration for model\ncollection selection with continual learning capabilities using data stream\nprocessing. The performance of the forecasting models based on the proposed\napproach is evaluated in a complex real-world use case of natural gas\nconsumption forecasting. We employed Hoeffding tree predictors as forecasting\nmodels and the Pruned Exact Linear Time (PELT) algorithm for the change point\ndetection procedure. The change point detection integration enables selecting a\ndifferent model collection for successive time frames. Thus, three model\ncollection selection procedures (with and without an error feedback loop) are\ndefined and evaluated for forecasting scenarios with various densities of\ndetected change points. These models were compared with change point agnostic\nbaseline approaches. Our experiments show that fewer change points result in a\nlower forecasting error regardless of the model collection selection procedure\nemployed. Also, simpler model collection selection procedures omitting\nforecasting error feedback leads to more robust forecasting models suitable for\ncontinual learning tasks.",

Non-contrast CT (NCCT) examinations from 232 acute ischemic\nstroke patients who were enrolled in the DEFUSE 3 trial were included in this\nstudy. Three experienced neuroradiologists independently segmented hypodensity\nthat reflected the ischemic core on each scan. The neuroradiologist with the\nmost experience (expert A) served as the ground truth for deep learning model\ntraining. Two additional neuroradiologists (experts B and C) segmentations were\nused for data testing. The 232 studies were randomly split into training and\ntest sets. The training set was further randomly divided into 5 folds with\ntraining and validation sets. A 3-dimensional CNN architecture was trained and\noptimized to predict the segmentations of expert A from NCCT. The performance\nof the model was assessed using a set of volume, overlap, and distance metrics\nusing non-inferiority thresholds of 20%, 3ml, and 3mm. The optimized model\ntrained on expert A was compared to test experts B and C. We used a one-sided\nWilcoxon signed-rank test to test for the non-inferiority of the model-expert\ncompared to the inter-expert agreement.

          "description": "Drift in machine learning refers to the phenomenon where the statistical\nproperties of data or context, in which the model operates, change over time\nleading to a decrease in its performance. Therefore, maintaining a constant\nmonitoring process for machine learning model performance is crucial in order\nto proactively prevent any potential performance regression. However,\nsupervised drift detection methods require human annotation and consequently\nlead to a longer time to detect and mitigate the drift. In our proposed\nunsupervised drift detection method, we follow a two step process. Our first\nstep involves encoding a sample of production data as the target distribution,\nand the model training data as the reference distribution. In the second step,\nwe employ a kernel-based statistical test that utilizes the maximum mean\ndiscrepancy (MMD) distance metric to compare the reference and target\ndistributions and estimate any potential drift. Our method also identifies the\nsubset of production data that is the root cause of the drift. The models\nretrained using these identified high drift samples show improved performance\non online customer experience quality metrics.",

          "description": "Current machine learning methods struggle to solve Bongard problems, which\nare a type of IQ test that requires deriving an abstract \"concept\" from a set\nof positive and negative \"support\" images, and then classifying whether or not\na new query image depicts the key concept. On Bongard-HOI, a benchmark for\nnatural-image Bongard problems, existing methods have only reached 66% accuracy\n(where chance is 50%). Low accuracy is often attributed to neural nets' lack of\nability to find human-like symbolic rules. In this work, we point out that many\nexisting methods are forfeiting accuracy due to a much simpler problem: they do\nnot incorporate information contained in the support set as a whole, and rely\ninstead on information extracted from individual supports. This is a critical\nissue, because unlike in few-shot learning tasks concerning object\nclassification, the \"key concept\" in a typical Bongard problem can only be\ndistinguished using multiple positives and multiple negatives. We explore a\nvariety of simple methods to take this cross-image context into account, and\ndemonstrate substantial gains over prior methods, leading to new\nstate-of-the-art performance on Bongard-LOGO (75.3%) and Bongard-HOI (72.45%)\nand strong performance on the original Bongard problem set (60.84%).",

Typically, such a policy must be derived from\nobservational data, which introduces several challenges. While the problem of\n``endogeneity'' is prominently studied in the established pricing literature,\nthe problem of selection bias (or, more precisely, bid selection bias) is not.\nWe take a step towards understanding the effects of selection bias by posing\npricing as a problem of causal inference. Specifically, we consider the\nreaction of a customer to price a treatment effect. In our experiments, we\nsimulate varying levels of selection bias on a semi-synthetic dataset on\nmortgage loan applications in Belgium. We investigate the potential of\nparametric and nonparametric methods for the identification of individual\nbid-response functions.

We use Neural\nOperators, a resolution invariant architecture that guarantees that the model\ntraining is independent of the data sampling frequency. We first present the\nconditional ground-motion synthesis algorithm (referred to heretofore as\ncGM-GANO) and discuss its advantages compared to previous work. Next, we verify\nthe cGM-GANO framework using simulated ground motions generated with the\nSouthern California Earthquake Center (SCEC) Broadband Platform (BBP). We\nlastly train cGM-GANO on a KiK-net dataset from Japan, showing that the\nframework can recover the magnitude, distance, and $V_{S30}$ scaling of Fourier\namplitude and pseudo-spectral accelerations. We evaluate cGM-GANO through\nresidual analysis with the empirical dataset as well as by comparison with\nconventional Ground Motion Models (GMMs) for selected ground motion scenarios.\nResults show that cGM-GANO produces consistent median scaling with the GMMs for\nthe corresponding tectonic environments. The largest misfit is observed at\nshort distances due to the scarcity of training data. With the exception of\nshort distances, the aleatory variability of the response spectral ordinates is\nalso well captured, especially for subduction events due to the adequacy of\ntraining data.

          "description": "With the fast-growing and evolving omics data, the demand for streamlined and\nadaptable tools to handle the analysis continues to grow. In response to this\nneed, we introduce Auto Bioinformatics Analysis (AutoBA), an autonomous AI\nagent based on a large language model designed explicitly for conventional\nomics data analysis. AutoBA simplifies the analytical process by requiring\nminimal user input while delivering detailed step-by-step plans for various\nbioinformatics tasks. Through rigorous validation by expert bioinformaticians,\nAutoBA's robustness and adaptability are affirmed across a diverse range of\nomics analysis cases, including whole genome sequencing (WGS), RNA sequencing\n(RNA-seq), single-cell RNA-seq, ChIP-seq, and spatial transcriptomics. AutoBA's\nunique capacity to self-design analysis processes based on input data\nvariations further underscores its versatility. Compared with online\nbioinformatic services, AutoBA deploys the analysis locally, preserving data\nprivacy. Moreover, different from the predefined pipeline, AutoBA has\nadaptability in sync with emerging bioinformatics tools. Overall, AutoBA\nrepresents a convenient tool, offering robustness and adaptability for complex\nomics data analysis.",

This paper provides an instance space analysis for sports\ntimetabling, resulting in powerful insights into the strengths and weaknesses\nof eight state-of-the-art algorithms. Based on machine learning techniques, we\npropose an algorithm selection system that predicts which algorithm is likely\nto perform best when given the characteristics of a sports timetabling problem\ninstance. Furthermore, we identify which characteristics are important in\nmaking that prediction, providing insights in the performance of the\nalgorithms, and suggestions to further improve them. Finally, we assess the\nempirical hardness of the instances.

          "description": "Joint Embedding Architecture-based self-supervised learning methods have\nattributed the composition of data augmentations as a crucial factor for their\nstrong representation learning capabilities. While regional dropout strategies\nhave proven to guide models to focus on lesser indicative parts of the objects\nin supervised methods, it hasn't been adopted by self-supervised methods for\ngenerating positive pairs. This is because the regional dropout methods are not\nsuitable for the input sampling process of the self-supervised methodology.\nWhereas dropping informative pixels from the positive pairs can result in\ninefficient training, replacing patches of a specific object with a different\none can steer the model from maximizing the agreement between different\npositive pairs. Moreover, joint embedding representation learning methods have\nnot made robustness their primary training outcome. To this end, we propose the\nViewMix augmentation policy, specially designed for self-supervised learning,\nupon generating different views of the same image, patches are cut and pasted\nfrom one view to another. By leveraging the different views created by this\naugmentation strategy, multiple joint embedding-based self-supervised\nmethodologies obtained better localization capability and consistently\noutperformed their corresponding baseline methods. It is also demonstrated that\nincorporating ViewMix augmentation policy promotes robustness of the\nrepresentations in the state-of-the-art methods.

In our research we identify 25\nproposed distillation loss terms from 14 publications in the last 4 years.\nUnfortunately, a comparison of terms based on published results is often\nimpossible, because of differences in training configurations. A good\nillustration of this problem is the comparison of two publications from 2022.\nUsing the same models and dataset, Structural and Statistical Texture\nDistillation (SSTKD) reports an increase of student mIoU of 4.54 and a final\nperformance of 29.19, while Adaptive Perspective Distillation (APD) only\nimproves student performance by 2.06 percentage points, but achieves a final\nperformance of 39.25. The reason for such extreme differences is often a\nsuboptimal choice of hyperparameters and a resulting underperformance of the\nstudent model used as reference point. In our work, we reveal problems of\ninsufficient hyperparameter tuning by showing that distillation improvements of\ntwo widely accepted frameworks, SKD and IFVD, vanish when hyperparameters are\noptimized sufficiently. To improve comparability of future research in the\nfield, we establish a solid baseline for three datasets and two student models\nand provide extensive information on hyperparameter tuning.

          "description": "The analysis of Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imagery is an important step\nin remote sensing applications, and it is a challenging problem due to its\ninherent speckle noise. One typical solution is to model the data using the\n$G_I^0$ distribution and extract its roughness information, which in turn can\nbe used in posterior imaging tasks, such as segmentation, classification and\ninterpretation. This leads to the need of quick and reliable estimation of the\nroughness parameter from SAR data, especially with high resolution images.\nUnfortunately, traditional parameter estimation procedures are slow and prone\nto estimation failures. In this work, we proposed a neural network-based\nestimation framework that first learns how to predict underlying parameters of\n$G_I^0$ samples and then can be used to estimate the roughness of unseen data.\nWe show that this approach leads to an estimator that is quicker, yields less\nestimation error and is less prone to failures than the traditional estimation\nprocedures for this problem, even when we use a simple network. More\nimportantly, we show that this same methodology can be generalized to handle\nimage inputs and, even if trained on purely synthetic data for a few seconds,\nis able to perform real time pixel-wise roughness estimation for high\nresolution real SAR imagery.",

The training of an efficacious deep learning model requires large\ndata with diverse styles and qualities. The diversity of data often comes from\nthe use of various scanners of vendors. But, in practice, it is impractical to\ncollect a sufficient amount of diverse data for training. To this end, a novel\ncontrastive learning is developed to equip the deep learning models with better\nstyle generalization capability. Specifically, the multi-style and multi-view\nunsupervised self-learning scheme is carried out to seek robust feature\nembedding against style diversity as a pretrained model. Afterward, the\npretrained network is further fine-tuned to the downstream tasks, e.g., mass\ndetection, matching, BI-RADS rating, and breast density classification. The\nproposed method has been evaluated extensively and rigorously with mammograms\nfrom various vendor style domains and several public datasets. The experimental\nresults suggest that the proposed domain generalization method can effectively\nimprove performance of four mammographic image tasks on the data from both seen\nand unseen domains, and outperform many state-of-the-art (SOTA) generalization\nmethods.",

We use these as tools to enhance adversarial robustness by\nmaximizing the expected loss over a neighborhood of distributions, a technique\nknown as distributionally robust optimization.

We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on\nmalware detection and image recognition applications and find that, to our\nknowledge, it outperforms existing methods at enhancing the robustness against\nadversarial attacks. $ARMOR_D$ yields the robustified accuracy of $98.29\\%$\nagainst $FGSM$ and $98.18\\%$ against $PGD^{40}$ on the MNIST dataset, reducing\nthe error rate by more than $19.7\\%$ and $37.2\\%$ respectively compared to\nprior methods.

          "description": "Estimating the effects of treatments with an associated dose on an instance's\noutcome, the \"dose response\", is relevant in a variety of domains, from\nhealthcare to business, economics, and beyond. Such effects, also known as\ncontinuous-valued treatment effects, are typically estimated from observational\ndata, which may be subject to dose selection bias. This means that the\nallocation of doses depends on pre-treatment covariates. Previous studies have\nshown that conventional machine learning approaches fail to learn accurate\nindividual estimates of dose responses under the presence of dose selection\nbias. In this work, we propose CBRNet, a causal machine learning approach to\nestimate an individual dose response from observational data. CBRNet adopts the\nNeyman-Rubin potential outcome framework and extends the concept of balanced\nrepresentation learning for overcoming selection bias to continuous-valued\ntreatments. Our work is the first to apply representation balancing in a\ncontinuous-valued treatment setting. We evaluate our method on a newly proposed\nbenchmark.

However, the distribution shift\ninduced by novel data typically results in degraded performance on past data.\nTaking a step towards efficient continual pre-training, in this work, we\nexamine the effect of different warm-up strategies. Our hypothesis is that the\nlearning rate must be re-increased to improve compute efficiency when training\non a new dataset. We study the warmup phase of models pre-trained on the Pile\n(upstream data, 300B tokens) as we continue to pre-train on SlimPajama\n(downstream data, 297B tokens), following a linear warmup and cosine decay\nschedule. We conduct all experiments on the Pythia 410M language model\narchitecture and evaluate performance through validation perplexity. We\nexperiment with different pre-training checkpoints, various maximum learning\nrates, and various warmup lengths. Our results show that while rewarming models\nfirst increases the loss on upstream and downstream data, in the longer run it\nimproves the downstream performance, outperforming models trained from\nscratch$\\unicode{x2013}$even for a large downstream dataset.",

Unlike other approaches, the Trinary decision tree does not assume\nthat missing values contain any information about the response. Both\ntheoretical calculations on estimator bias and numerical illustrations using\nreal data sets are presented to compare its performance with established\nalgorithms in different missing data scenarios (Missing Completely at Random\n(MCAR), and Informative Missingness (IM)). Notably, the Trinary tree\noutperforms its peers in MCAR settings, especially when data is only missing\nout-of-sample, while lacking behind in IM settings. A hybrid model, the\nTrinaryMIA tree, which combines the Trinary tree and the Missing In Attributes\n(MIA) approach, shows robust performance in all types of missingness.

          "description": "Graph classification is a crucial task in many real-world multimedia\napplications, where graphs can represent various multimedia data types such as\nimages, videos, and social networks. Previous efforts have applied graph neural\nnetworks (GNNs) in balanced situations where the class distribution is\nbalanced. However, real-world data typically exhibit long-tailed class\ndistributions, resulting in a bias towards the head classes when using GNNs and\nlimited generalization ability over the tail classes. Recent approaches mainly\nfocus on re-balancing different classes during model training, which fails to\nexplicitly introduce new knowledge and sacrifices the performance of the head\nclasses. To address these drawbacks, we propose a novel framework called\nRetrieval Augmented Hybrid Network (RAHNet) to jointly learn a robust feature\nextractor and an unbiased classifier in a decoupled manner. In the feature\nextractor training stage, we develop a graph retrieval module to search for\nrelevant graphs that directly enrich the intra-class diversity for the tail\nclasses. Moreover, we innovatively optimize a category-centered supervised\ncontrastive loss to obtain discriminative representations, which is more\nsuitable for long-tailed scenarios. In the classifier fine-tuning stage, we\nbalance the classifier weights with two weight regularization techniques, i.e.,\nMax-norm and weight decay. Experiments on various popular benchmarks verify the\nsuperiority of the proposed method against state-of-the-art approaches.",

In\neach step, they adequately tune the interaction of biomechanical muscle\ndynamics and neuronal signals to be robust against uncertainties in ground\nconditions. However, it is still not fully understood how the nervous system\nresolves the musculoskeletal redundancy to solve the multi-objective control\nproblem considering stability, robustness, and energy efficiency. In computer\nsimulations, energy minimization has been shown to be a successful optimization\ntarget, reproducing natural walking with trajectory optimization or\nreflex-based control methods.

In robotics, reinforcement learning~(RL) methods recently\nachieved highly stable (and efficient) locomotion on quadruped systems, but the\ngeneration of human-like walking with bipedal biomechanical models has required\nextensive use of expert data sets. This strong reliance on demonstrations often\nresults in brittle policies and limits the application to new behaviors,\nespecially considering the potential variety of movements for high-dimensional\nmusculoskeletal models in 3D.

          "description": "Over the last decades, Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) has been intensively\nstudied by the Machine Learning community. Despite its versatility and\nexcellent performance, the optimization of large models via SGD still is a\ntime-consuming task. To reduce training time, it is common to distribute the\ntraining process across multiple devices. Recently, it has been shown that the\nconvergence of asynchronous SGD (ASGD) will always be faster than mini-batch\nSGD. However, despite these improvements in the theoretical bounds, most ASGD\nconvergence-rate proofs still rely on a centralized parameter server, which is\nprone to become a bottleneck when scaling out the gradient computations across\nmany distributed processes.\n\nIn this paper, we present a novel convergence-rate analysis for decentralized\nand asynchronous SGD (DASGD) which does not require partial synchronization\namong nodes nor restrictive network topologies. Specifically, we provide a\nbound of $\\mathcal{O}(\\sigma\\epsilon^{-2}) +\n\\mathcal{O}(QS_{avg}\\epsilon^{-3/2}) + \\mathcal{O}(S_{avg}\\epsilon^{-1})$ for\nthe convergence rate of DASGD, where $S_{avg}$ is the average staleness between\nmodels, $Q$ is a constant that bounds the norm of the gradients, and $\\epsilon$\nis a (small) error that is allowed within the bound. Furthermore, when\ngradients are not bounded, we prove the convergence rate of DASGD to be\n$\\mathcal{O}(\\sigma\\epsilon^{-2}) +\n\\mathcal{O}(\\sqrt{\\hat{S}_{avg}\\hat{S}_{max}}\\epsilon^{-1})$, with\n$\\hat{S}_{max}$ and $\\hat{S}_{avg}$ representing a loose version of the average\nand maximum staleness, respectively. Our convergence proof holds for a fixed\nstepsize and any non-convex, homogeneous, and L-smooth objective function. We\nanticipate that our results will be of high relevance for the adoption of DASGD\nby a broad community of researchers and developers.",

We propose a simple decoding strategy for reducing\nhallucinations with pretrained LLMs that does not require conditioning on\nretrieved external knowledge nor additional fine-tuning. Our approach obtains\nthe next-token distribution by contrasting the differences in logits obtained\nfrom projecting the later layers versus earlier layers to the vocabulary space,\nexploiting the fact that factual knowledge in an LLMs has generally been shown\nto be localized to particular transformer layers.

          "description": "Interpolators are unstable. For example, the mininum $\\ell_2$ norm least\nsquare interpolator exhibits unbounded test errors when dealing with noisy\ndata. In this paper, we study how ensemble stabilizes and thus improves the\ngeneralization performance, measured by the out-of-sample prediction risk, of\nan individual interpolator. We focus on bagged linear interpolators, as bagging\nis a popular randomization-based ensemble method that can be implemented in\nparallel. We introduce the multiplier-bootstrap-based bagged least square\nestimator, which can then be formulated as an average of the sketched least\nsquare estimators. The proposed multiplier bootstrap encompasses the classical\nbootstrap with replacement as a special case, along with a more intriguing\nvariant which we call the Bernoulli bootstrap.\n\nFocusing on the proportional regime where the sample size scales\nproportionally with the feature dimensionality, we investigate the\nout-of-sample prediction risks of the sketched and bagged least square\nestimators in both underparametrized and overparameterized regimes. Our results\nreveal the statistical roles of sketching and bagging. In particular, sketching\nmodifies the aspect ratio and shifts the interpolation threshold of the minimum\n$\\ell_2$ norm estimator. However, the risk of the sketched estimator continues\nto be unbounded around the interpolation threshold due to excessive variance.\nIn stark contrast, bagging effectively mitigates this variance, leading to a\nbounded limiting out-of-sample prediction risk. To further understand this\nstability improvement property, we establish that bagging acts as a form of\nimplicit regularization, substantiated by the equivalence of the bagged\nestimator with its explicitly regularized counterpart.

          "description": "Deep neural networks employing error back-propagation for learning can suffer\nfrom exploding and vanishing gradient problems. Numerous solutions have been\nproposed such as normalisation techniques or limiting activation functions to\nlinear rectifying units. In this work we follow a different approach which is\nparticularly applicable to closed-loop learning of forward models where\nback-propagation makes exclusive use of the sign of the error signal to prime\nthe learning, whilst a global relevance signal modulates the rate of learning.\nThis is inspired by the interaction between local plasticity and a global\nneuromodulation. For example, whilst driving on an empty road, one can allow\nfor slow step-wise optimisation of actions, whereas, at a busy junction, an\nerror must be corrected at once. Hence, the error is the priming signal and the\nintensity of the experience is a modulating factor in the weight change. The\nadvantages of this Prime and Modulate paradigm is twofold: it is free from\nnormalisation and it makes use of relevant cues from the environment to enrich\nthe learning. We present a mathematical derivation of the learning rule in\nz-space and demonstrate the real-time performance with a robotic platform.

We\npresent Blended-NeRF, a robust and flexible framework for editing a specific\nregion of interest in an existing NeRF scene, based on text prompts, along with\na 3D ROI box. Our method leverages a pretrained language-image model to steer\nthe synthesis towards a user-provided text prompt, along with a 3D MLP model\ninitialized on an existing NeRF scene to generate the object and blend it into\na specified region in the original scene. We allow local editing by localizing\na 3D ROI box in the input scene, and blend the content synthesized inside the\nROI with the existing scene using a novel volumetric blending technique.

          "description": "With the overwhelming trend of mask image modeling led by MAE, generative\npre-training has shown a remarkable potential to boost the performance of\nfundamental models in 2D vision. However, in 3D vision, the over-reliance on\nTransformer-based backbones and the unordered nature of point clouds have\nrestricted the further development of generative pre-training. In this paper,\nwe propose a novel 3D-to-2D generative pre-training method that is adaptable to\nany point cloud model. We propose to generate view images from different\ninstructed poses via the cross-attention mechanism as the pre-training scheme.\nGenerating view images has more precise supervision than its point cloud\ncounterpart, thus assisting 3D backbones to have a finer comprehension of the\ngeometrical structure and stereoscopic relations of the point cloud.\nExperimental results have proved the superiority of our proposed 3D-to-2D\ngenerative pre-training over previous pre-training methods. Our method is also\neffective in boosting the performance of architecture-oriented approaches,\nachieving state-of-the-art performance when fine-tuning on ScanObjectNN\nclassification and ShapeNetPart segmentation tasks.

          "description": "Adaptive interfaces can help users perform sequential decision-making tasks\nlike robotic teleoperation given noisy, high-dimensional command signals (e.g.,\nfrom a brain-computer interface). Recent advances in human-in-the-loop machine\nlearning enable such systems to improve by interacting with users, but tend to\nbe limited by the amount of data that they can collect from individual users in\npractice. In this paper, we propose a reinforcement learning algorithm to\naddress this by training an interface to map raw command signals to actions\nusing a combination of offline pre-training and online fine-tuning. To address\nthe challenges posed by noisy command signals and sparse rewards, we develop a\nnovel method for representing and inferring the user's long-term intent for a\ngiven trajectory. We primarily evaluate our method's ability to assist users\nwho can only communicate through noisy, high-dimensional input channels through\na user study in which 12 participants performed a simulated navigation task by\nusing their eye gaze to modulate a 128-dimensional command signal from their\nwebcam. The results show that our method enables successful goal navigation\nmore often than a baseline directional interface, by learning to denoise user\ncommands signals and provide shared autonomy assistance. We further evaluate on\na simulated Sawyer pushing task with eye gaze control, and the Lunar Lander\ngame with simulated user commands, and find that our method improves over\nbaseline interfaces in these domains as well. Extensive ablation experiments\nwith simulated user commands empirically motivate each component of our method.",

We further\ndevelop this perspective, incorporate importance sampling, and show that 1)\nWasserstein GAN performs a biased estimate of the partition function, and we\npropose instead to use an unbiased estimator; and 2) when optimizing for\nlikelihood, one must maximize generator entropy. This is hypothesized to\nprovide a better mode coverage. Different from previous works, we explicitly\ncompute the density of the generated samples. This is the key enabler to\ndesigning an unbiased estimator of the partition function and computation of\nthe generator entropy term. The generator density is obtained via a new type of\nflow network, called one-way flow network, that is less constrained in terms of\narchitecture, as it does not require a tractable inverse function.

          "description": "Distribution shifts are all too common in real-world applications of machine\nlearning. Domain adaptation (DA) aims to address this by providing various\nframeworks for adapting models to the deployment data without using labels.\nHowever, the domain shift scenario raises a second more subtle challenge: the\ndifficulty of performing hyperparameter optimisation (HPO) for these adaptation\nalgorithms without access to a labelled validation set. The unclear validation\nprotocol for DA has led to bad practices in the literature, such as performing\nHPO using the target test labels when, in real-world scenarios, they are not\navailable. This has resulted in over-optimism about DA research progress\ncompared to reality. In this paper, we analyse the state of DA when using good\nevaluation practice, by benchmarking a suite of candidate validation criteria\nand using them to assess popular adaptation algorithms. We show that there are\nchallenges across all three branches of domain adaptation methodology including\nUnsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA), Source-Free Domain Adaptation (SFDA), and\nTest Time Adaptation (TTA). While the results show that realistically\nachievable performance is often worse than expected, they also show that using\nproper validation splits is beneficial, as well as showing that some previously\nunexplored validation metrics provide the best options to date. Altogether, our\nimproved practices covering data, training, validation and hyperparameter\noptimisation form a new rigorous pipeline to improve benchmarking, and hence\nresearch progress, within this important field going forward.",

          "description": "Lithium-ion (Li-ion) batteries are the primary power source in various\napplications due to their high energy and power density. Their market was\nestimated to be up to 48 billion U.S. dollars in 2022. However, the widespread\nadoption of Li-ion batteries has resulted in counterfeit cell production, which\ncan pose safety hazards to users. Counterfeit cells can cause explosions or\nfires, and their prevalence in the market makes it difficult for users to\ndetect fake cells. Indeed, current battery authentication methods can be\nsusceptible to advanced counterfeiting techniques and are often not adaptable\nto various cells and systems. In this paper, we improve the state of the art on\nbattery authentication by proposing two novel methodologies, DCAuth and\nEISthentication, which leverage the internal characteristics of each cell\nthrough Machine Learning models. Our methods automatically authenticate\nlithium-ion battery models and architectures using data from their regular\nusage without the need for any external device. They are also resilient to the\nmost common and critical counterfeit practices and can scale to several\nbatteries and devices. To evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed\nmethodologies, we analyze time-series data from a total of 20 datasets that we\nhave processed to extract meaningful features for our analysis. Our methods\nachieve high accuracy in battery authentication for both architectures (up to\n0.99) and models (up to 0.96). Moreover, our methods offer comparable\nidentification performances. By using our proposed methodologies, manufacturers\ncan ensure that devices only use legitimate batteries, guaranteeing the\noperational state of any system and safety measures for the users.",

          "description": "Temporal Knowledge Graph (TKG) is an extension of traditional Knowledge Graph\n(KG) that incorporates the dimension of time. Reasoning on TKGs is a crucial\ntask that aims to predict future facts based on historical occurrences. The key\nchallenge lies in uncovering structural dependencies within historical\nsubgraphs and temporal patterns. Most existing approaches model TKGs relying on\nentity modeling, as nodes in the graph play a crucial role in knowledge\nrepresentation. However, the real-world scenario often involves an extensive\nnumber of entities, with new entities emerging over time. This makes it\nchallenging for entity-dependent methods to cope with extensive volumes of\nentities, and effectively handling newly emerging entities also becomes a\nsignificant challenge. Therefore, we propose Temporal Inductive Path Neural\nNetwork (TiPNN), which models historical information in an entity-independent\nperspective. Specifically, TiPNN adopts a unified graph, namely history\ntemporal graph, to comprehensively capture and encapsulate information from\nhistory. Subsequently, we utilize the defined query-aware temporal paths to\nmodel historical path information related to queries on history temporal graph\nfor the reasoning. Extensive experiments illustrate that the proposed model not\nonly attains significant performance enhancements but also handles inductive\nsettings, while additionally facilitating the provision of reasoning evidence\nthrough history temporal graphs.",

          "description": "Advances in Semi-Supervised Learning (SSL) have almost entirely closed the\ngap between SSL and Supervised Learning at a fraction of the number of labels.\nHowever, recent performance improvements have often come \\textit{at the cost of\nsignificantly increased training computation}. To address this, we propose\nCurriculum Batch Size (CBS), \\textit{an unlabeled batch size curriculum which\nexploits the natural training dynamics of deep neural networks.} A small\nunlabeled batch size is used in the beginning of training and is gradually\nincreased to the end of training. A fixed curriculum is used regardless of\ndataset, model or number of epochs, and reduced training computations is\ndemonstrated on all settings.

We perform an ablation study to\nshow that strong labeled augmentation and/or CPL do not significantly reduce\ntraining computations, but, in synergy with CBS, they achieve optimal\nperformance.

Existing\nmeasures may fail to capture similarities due to local trends (shapes) and may\neven produce misleading results. Our goal is to develop a measure that looks\nfor similar trends occurring around similar times and is easily interpretable\nfor researchers in applied domains. This is particularly useful for\napplications where time-series have a sequence of meaningful local trends that\nare ordered, such as in epidemics (a surge to an increase to a peak to a\ndecrease). We propose a novel measure, DTW+S, which creates an interpretable\n\"closeness-preserving\" matrix representation of the time-series, where each\ncolumn represents local trends, and then it applies Dynamic Time Warping to\ncompute distances between these matrices. We present a theoretical analysis\nthat supports the choice of this representation. We demonstrate the utility of\nDTW+S in ensemble building and clustering of epidemic curves. We also\ndemonstrate that our approach results in better classification compared to\nDynamic Time Warping for a class of datasets, particularly when local trends\nrather than scale play a decisive role.",

Once trained,\nGraPhSyM provides accurate visibility of final design metrics to early EDA\nstages, such as logic synthesis, without running the slow physical synthesis\nflow, enabling global co-optimization across stages. Additionally, the swift\nand precise feedback provided by GraPhSyM is instrumental for\nmachine-learning-based EDA optimization frameworks. Given a gate-level netlist\nof a circuit represented as a graph, GraPhSyM utilizes graph structure,\nconnectivity, and electrical property features to predict the impact of\nphysical synthesis transformations such as buffer insertion and gate sizing.\nWhen trained on a dataset of 6000 prefix adder designs synthesized at an\naggressive delay target, GraPhSyM can accurately predict the post-synthesis\ndelay (98.3%) and area (96.1%) metrics of unseen adders with a fast 0.22s\ninference time. Furthermore, we illustrate the compositionality of GraPhSyM by\nemploying the model trained on a fixed delay target to accurately anticipate\npost-synthesis metrics at a variety of unseen delay targets. Lastly, we report\npromising generalization capabilities of the GraPhSyM model when it is\nevaluated on circuits different from the adders it was exclusively trained on.\nThe results show the potential for GraPhSyM to serve as a powerful tool for\nadvanced optimization techniques and as an oracle for EDA machine learning\nframeworks.",

However, most machine learning approaches developed for\nprediction of disease progression are either single-task or single-modality\nmodels, which can not be directly adopted to our setting involving multi-task\nlearning with high dimensional images. Moreover, most of those approaches are\ntrained on a single dataset (i.e. cohort), which can not be generalized to\nother cohorts. We propose a novel multimodal multi-task deep learning model to\npredict AD progression by analyzing longitudinal clinical and neuroimaging data\nfrom multiple cohorts. Our proposed model integrates high dimensional MRI\nfeatures from a 3D convolutional neural network with other data modalities,\nincluding clinical and demographic information, to predict the future\ntrajectory of patients. Our model employs an adversarial loss to alleviate the\nstudy-specific imaging bias, in particular the inter-study domain shifts. In\naddition, a Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM) optimization technique is\napplied to further improve model generalization. The proposed model is trained\nand tested on various datasets in order to evaluate and validate the results.\nOur results showed that 1) our model yields significant improvement over the\nbaseline models, and 2) models using extracted neuroimaging features from 3D\nconvolutional neural network outperform the same models when applied to\nMRI-derived volumetric features.",

          "description": "Cinematic audio source separation is a relatively new subtask of audio source\nseparation, with the aim of extracting the dialogue stem, the music stem, and\nthe effects stem from their mixture. In this work, we developed a model\ngeneralizing the Bandsplit RNN for any complete or overcomplete partitions of\nthe frequency axis. Psycho-acoustically motivated frequency scales were used to\ninform the band definitions which are now defined with redundancy for more\nreliable feature extraction. A loss function motivated by the signal-to-noise\nratio and the sparsity-promoting property of the 1-norm was proposed. We\nadditionally exploit the information-sharing property of a common-encoder setup\nto reduce computational complexity during both training and inference, improve\nseparation performance for hard-to-generalize classes of sounds, and allow\nflexibility during inference time with easily detachable decoders. Our best\nmodel sets the state of the art on the Divide and Remaster dataset with\nperformance above the ideal ratio mask for the dialogue stem.",

          "description": "Survival analysis is a valuable tool for estimating the time until specific\nevents, such as death or cancer recurrence, based on baseline observations.\nThis is particularly useful in healthcare to prognostically predict clinically\nimportant events based on patient data. However, existing approaches often have\nlimitations; some focus only on ranking patients by survivability, neglecting\nto estimate the actual event time, while others treat the problem as a\nclassification task, ignoring the inherent time-ordered structure of the\nevents. Furthermore, the effective utilization of censored samples - training\ndata points where the exact event time is unknown - is essential for improving\nthe predictive accuracy of the model. In this paper, we introduce CenTime, a\nnovel approach to survival analysis that directly estimates the time to event.\nOur method features an innovative event-conditional censoring mechanism that\nperforms robustly even when uncensored data is scarce. We demonstrate that our\napproach forms a consistent estimator for the event model parameters, even in\nthe absence of uncensored data. Furthermore, CenTime is easily integrated with\ndeep learning models with no restrictions on batch size or the number of\nuncensored samples. We compare our approach with standard survival analysis\nmethods, including the Cox proportional-hazard model and DeepHit. Our results\nindicate that CenTime offers state-of-the-art performance in predicting\ntime-to-death while maintaining comparable ranking performance.

          "description": "Causal inference plays a vital role in diverse domains like epidemiology,\nhealthcare, and economics. De-confounding and counterfactual prediction in\nobservational data has emerged as a prominent concern in causal inference\nresearch. While existing models tackle observed confounders, the presence of\nunobserved confounders remains a significant challenge, distorting causal\ninference and impacting counterfactual outcome accuracy. To address this, we\npropose a novel variational learning model of unobserved confounders for\ncounterfactual inference (VLUCI), which generates the posterior distribution of\nunobserved confounders. VLUCI relaxes the unconfoundedness assumption often\noverlooked by most causal inference methods. By disentangling observed and\nunobserved confounders, VLUCI constructs a doubly variational inference model\nto approximate the distribution of unobserved confounders, which are used for\ninferring more accurate counterfactual outcomes. Extensive experiments on\nsynthetic and semi-synthetic datasets demonstrate VLUCI's superior performance\nin inferring unobserved confounders. It is compatible with state-of-the-art\ncounterfactual inference models, significantly improving inference accuracy at\nboth group and individual levels. Additionally, VLUCI provides confidence\nintervals for counterfactual outcomes, aiding decision-making in risk-sensitive\ndomains. We further clarify the considerations when applying VLUCI to cases\nwhere unobserved confounders don't strictly conform to our model assumptions\nusing the public IHDP dataset as an example, highlighting the practical\nadvantages of VLUCI.",

          "description": "We present a novel approach to single-view face relighting in the wild.\nHandling non-diffuse effects, such as global illumination or cast shadows, has\nlong been a challenge in face relighting. Prior work often assumes Lambertian\nsurfaces, simplified lighting models or involves estimating 3D shape, albedo,\nor a shadow map. This estimation, however, is error-prone and requires many\ntraining examples with lighting ground truth to generalize well. Our work\nbypasses the need for accurate estimation of intrinsic components and can be\ntrained solely on 2D images without any light stage data, multi-view images, or\nlighting ground truth. Our key idea is to leverage a conditional diffusion\nimplicit model (DDIM) for decoding a disentangled light encoding along with\nother encodings related to 3D shape and facial identity inferred from\noff-the-shelf estimators. We also propose a novel conditioning technique that\neases the modeling of the complex interaction between light and geometry by\nusing a rendered shading reference to spatially modulate the DDIM. We achieve\nstate-of-the-art performance on standard benchmark Multi-PIE and can\nphotorealistically relight in-the-wild images. Please visit our page:\nhttps://diffusion-face-relighting.github.io",

          "description": "One of the most common things that a genealogist is tasked with is the\ngathering of a person's initial family history, normally via in-person\ninterviews or with the use of a platform such as ancestry.com, as this can\nprovide a strong foundation upon which a genealogist may build. However, the\nability to conduct these interviews can often be hindered by both geographical\nconstraints and the technical proficiency of the interviewee, as the\ninterviewee in these types of interviews is most often an elderly person with a\nlower than average level of technical proficiency. With this in mind, this\nstudy presents what we believe, based on prior research, to be the first\nchatbot geared entirely towards the gathering of family histories, and explores\nthe viability of utilising such a chatbot by comparing the performance and\nusability of such a method with the aforementioned alternatives. With a\nchatbot-based approach, we show that, though the average time taken to conduct\nan interview may be longer than if the user had used ancestry.com or\nparticipated in an in-person interview, the number of mistakes made and the\nlevel of confusion from the user regarding the UI and process required is lower\nthan the other two methods. Note that the final metric regarding the user's\nconfusion is not applicable for the in-person interview sessions due to its\nlack of a UI. With refinement, we believe this use of a chatbot could be a\nvaluable tool for genealogists, especially when dealing with interviewees who\nare based in other countries where it is not possible to conduct an in-person\ninterview.",

          "description": "In recent years, there is a growing interest in combining techniques\nattributed to the areas of Statistics and Machine Learning in order to obtain\nthe benefits of both approaches. In this article, the statistical technique\nlasso for variable selection is represented through a neural network. It is\nobserved that, although both the statistical approach and its neural version\nhave the same objective function, they differ due to their optimization. In\nparticular, the neural version is usually optimized in one-step using a single\nvalidation set, while the statistical counterpart uses a two-step optimization\nbased on cross-validation. The more elaborated optimization of the statistical\nmethod results in more accurate parameter estimation, especially when the\ntraining set is small. For this reason, a modification of the standard approach\nfor training neural networks, that mimics the statistical framework, is\nproposed. During the development of the above modification, a new optimization\nalgorithm for identifying the significant variables emerged. Experimental\nresults, using synthetic and real data sets, show that this new optimization\nalgorithm achieves better performance than any of the three previous\noptimization approaches.",

          "description": "The utility of reinforcement learning is limited by the alignment of reward\nfunctions with the interests of human stakeholders. One promising method for\nalignment is to learn the reward function from human-generated preferences\nbetween pairs of trajectory segments, a type of reinforcement learning from\nhuman feedback (RLHF). These human preferences are typically assumed to be\ninformed solely by partial return, the sum of rewards along each segment. We\nfind this assumption to be flawed and propose modeling human preferences\ninstead as informed by each segment's regret, a measure of a segment's\ndeviation from optimal decision-making. Given infinitely many preferences\ngenerated according to regret, we prove that we can identify a reward function\nequivalent to the reward function that generated those preferences, and we\nprove that the previous partial return model lacks this identifiability\nproperty in multiple contexts. We empirically show that our proposed regret\npreference model outperforms the partial return preference model with finite\ntraining data in otherwise the same setting. Additionally, we find that our\nproposed regret preference model better predicts real human preferences and\nalso learns reward functions from these preferences that lead to policies that\nare better human-aligned. Overall, this work establishes that the choice of\npreference model is impactful, and our proposed regret preference model\nprovides an improvement upon a core assumption of recent research. We have open\nsourced our experimental code, the human preferences dataset we gathered, and\nour training and preference elicitation interfaces for gathering a such a\ndataset.",

Paradoxically, empirical evidence indicates that even systems which\nare robust to large random perturbations of the input data remain susceptible\nto small, easily constructed, adversarial perturbations of their inputs. Here,\nwe show that this may be seen as a fundamental feature of classifiers working\nwith high dimensional input data. We introduce a simple generic and\ngeneralisable framework for which key behaviours observed in practical systems\narise with high probability -- notably the simultaneous susceptibility of the\n(otherwise accurate) model to easily constructed adversarial attacks, and\nrobustness to random perturbations of the input data. We confirm that the same\nphenomena are directly observed in practical neural networks trained on\nstandard image classification problems, where even large additive random noise\nfails to trigger the adversarial instability of the network. A surprising\ntakeaway is that even small margins separating a classifier's decision surface\nfrom training and testing data can hide adversarial susceptibility from being\ndetected using randomly sampled perturbations. Counterintuitively, using\nadditive noise during training or testing is therefore inefficient for\neradicating or detecting adversarial examples, and more demanding adversarial\ntraining is required.",

However, since SimTSC relies on pairwise DTW distances, the quadratic\ncomplexity of DTW limits its usability to only reasonably sized datasets. To\naddress this challenge, we propose a new efficient semi-supervised time series\nclassification technique, LB-SimTSC, with a new graph construction module.\nInstead of using DTW, we propose to utilize a lower bound of DTW, LB_Keogh, to\napproximate the dissimilarity between instances in linear time, while retaining\nthe relative proximity relationships one would have obtained via computing DTW.\nWe construct the pairwise distance matrix using LB_Keogh and build a graph for\nthe graph neural network. We apply this approach to the ten largest datasets\nfrom the well-known UCR time series classification archive. The results\ndemonstrate that this approach can be up to 104x faster than SimTSC when\nconstructing the graph on large datasets without significantly decreasing\nclassification accuracy.",

          "description": "Drug repositioning-a promising strategy for discovering new therapeutic uses\nfor existing drugs-has been increasingly explored in the computational science\nliterature using biomedical databases. However, the technological potential of\ndrug repositioning candidates has often been overlooked. This study presents a\nnovel protocol to comprehensively analyse various sources such as\npharmaceutical patents and biomedical databases, and identify drug\nrepositioning candidates with both technological potential and scientific\nevidence. To this end, first, we constructed a scientific biomedical knowledge\ngraph (s-BKG) comprising relationships between drugs, diseases, and genes\nderived from biomedical databases. Our protocol involves identifying drugs that\nexhibit limited association with the target disease but are closely located in\nthe s-BKG, as potential drug candidates. We constructed a patent-informed\nbiomedical knowledge graph (p-BKG) by adding pharmaceutical patent information.\nFinally, we developed a graph embedding protocol to ascertain the structure of\nthe p-BKG, thereby calculating the relevance scores of those candidates with\ntarget disease-related patents to evaluate their technological potential. Our\ncase study on Alzheimer's disease demonstrates its efficacy and feasibility,\nwhile the quantitative outcomes and systematic methods are expected to bridge\nthe gap between computational discoveries and successful market applications in\ndrug repositioning research.",

          "description": "Personalized federated learning has received an upsurge of attention due to\nthe mediocre performance of conventional federated learning (FL) over\nheterogeneous data. Unlike conventional FL which trains a single global\nconsensus model, personalized FL allows different models for different clients.\nHowever, existing personalized FL algorithms only implicitly transfer the\ncollaborative knowledge across the federation by embedding the knowledge into\nthe aggregated model or regularization. We observed that this implicit\nknowledge transfer fails to maximize the potential of each client's empirical\nrisk toward other clients. Based on our observation, in this work, we propose\nPersonalized Global Federated Learning (PGFed), a novel personalized FL\nframework that enables each client to personalize its own global objective by\nexplicitly and adaptively aggregating the empirical risks of itself and other\nclients. To avoid massive (O(N^2)) communication overhead and potential privacy\nleakage while achieving this, each client's risk is estimated through a\nfirst-order approximation for other clients' adaptive risk aggregation. On top\nof PGFed, we develop a momentum upgrade, dubbed PGFedMo, to more efficiently\nutilize clients' empirical risks. Our extensive experiments on four datasets\nunder different federated settings show consistent improvements of PGFed over\nprevious state-of-the-art methods.

          "description": "Labeling neural network submodules with human-legible descriptions is useful\nfor many downstream tasks: such descriptions can surface failures, guide\ninterventions, and perhaps even explain important model behaviors. To date,\nmost mechanistic descriptions of trained networks have involved small models,\nnarrowly delimited phenomena, and large amounts of human labor. Labeling all\nhuman-interpretable sub-computations in models of increasing size and\ncomplexity will almost certainly require tools that can generate and validate\ndescriptions automatically. Recently, techniques that use learned models\nin-the-loop for labeling have begun to gain traction, but methods for\nevaluating their efficacy are limited and ad-hoc. How should we validate and\ncompare open-ended labeling tools? This paper introduces FIND (Function\nINterpretation and Description), a benchmark suite for evaluating the building\nblocks of automated interpretability methods. FIND contains functions that\nresemble components of trained neural networks, and accompanying descriptions\nof the kind we seek to generate. The functions are procedurally constructed\nacross textual and numeric domains, and involve a range of real-world\ncomplexities, including noise, composition, approximation, and bias. We\nevaluate new and existing methods that use language models (LMs) to produce\ncode-based and language descriptions of function behavior. We find that an\noff-the-shelf LM augmented with only black-box access to functions can\nsometimes infer their structure, acting as a scientist by forming hypotheses,\nproposing experiments, and updating descriptions in light of new data. However,\nLM-based descriptions tend to capture global function behavior and miss local\ncorruptions. These results show that FIND will be useful for characterizing the\nperformance of more sophisticated interpretability methods before they are\napplied to real-world models.",

          "description": "Multi-task learning (MTL) is a powerful approach in deep learning that\nleverages the information from multiple tasks during training to improve model\nperformance. In medical imaging, MTL has shown great potential to solve various\ntasks. However, existing MTL architectures in medical imaging are limited in\nsharing information across tasks, reducing the potential performance\nimprovements of MTL. In this study, we introduce a novel attention-based MTL\nframework to better leverage inter-task interactions for various tasks from\npixel-level to image-level predictions. Specifically, we propose a Cross-Task\nAttention Network (CTAN) which utilizes cross-task attention mechanisms to\nincorporate information by interacting across tasks. We validated CTAN on four\nmedical imaging datasets that span different domains and tasks including:\nradiation treatment planning prediction using planning CT images of two\ndifferent target cancers (Prostate, OpenKBP); pigmented skin lesion\nsegmentation and diagnosis using dermatoscopic images (HAM10000); and COVID-19\ndiagnosis and severity prediction using chest CT scans (STOIC). Our study\ndemonstrates the effectiveness of CTAN in improving the accuracy of medical\nimaging tasks. Compared to standard single-task learning (STL), CTAN\ndemonstrated a 4.67% improvement in performance and outperformed both widely\nused MTL baselines: hard parameter sharing (HPS) with an average performance\nimprovement of 3.22%; and multi-task attention network (MTAN) with a relative\ndecrease of 5.38%. These findings highlight the significance of our proposed\nMTL framework in solving medical imaging tasks and its potential to improve\ntheir accuracy across domains.",

          "description": "Knowledge graph (KG) embedding has been used to benefit the diagnosis of\nanimal diseases by analyzing electronic medical records (EMRs), such as notes\nand veterinary records. However, learning representations to capture entities\nand relations with literal information in KGs is challenging as the KGs show\nheterogeneous properties and various types of literal information. Meanwhile,\nthe existing methods mostly aim to preserve graph structures surrounding target\nnodes without considering different types of literals, which could also carry\nsignificant information. In this paper, we propose a knowledge graph embedding\nmodel for the efficient diagnosis of animal diseases, which could learn various\ntypes of literal information and graph structure and fuse them into unified\nrepresentations, namely LiteralKG. Specifically, we construct a knowledge graph\nthat is built from EMRs along with literal information collected from various\nanimal hospitals. We then fuse different types of entities and node feature\ninformation into unified vector representations through gate networks. Finally,\nwe propose a self-supervised learning task to learn graph structure in pretext\ntasks and then towards various downstream tasks. Experimental results on link\nprediction tasks demonstrate that our model outperforms the baselines that\nconsist of state-of-the-art models.

          "description": "The Cancer Registry of Norway (CRN) collects information on cancer patients\nby receiving cancer messages from different medical entities (e.g., medical\nlabs, and hospitals) in Norway. Such messages are validated by an automated\ncancer registry system: GURI. Its correct operation is crucial since it lays\nthe foundation for cancer research and provides critical cancer-related\nstatistics to its stakeholders. Constructing a cyber-cyber digital twin (CCDT)\nfor GURI can facilitate various experiments and advanced analyses of the\noperational state of GURI without requiring intensive interactions with the\nreal system. However, GURI constantly evolves due to novel medical diagnostics\nand treatment, technological advances, etc. Accordingly, CCDT should evolve as\nwell to synchronize with GURI. A key challenge of achieving such\nsynchronization is that evolving CCDT needs abundant data labelled by the new\nGURI. To tackle this challenge, we propose EvoCLINICAL, which considers the\nCCDT developed for the previous version of GURI as the pretrained model and\nfine-tunes it with the dataset labelled by querying a new GURI version.\nEvoCLINICAL employs a genetic algorithm to select an optimal subset of cancer\nmessages from a candidate dataset and query GURI with it. We evaluate\nEvoCLINICAL on three evolution processes. The precision, recall, and F1 score\nare all greater than 91%, demonstrating the effectiveness of EvoCLINICAL.\nFurthermore, we replace the active learning part of EvoCLINICAL with random\nselection to study the contribution of transfer learning to the overall\nperformance of EvoCLINICAL. Results show that employing active learning in\nEvoCLINICAL increases its performances consistently.",

          "description": "Decision forests are widely used for classification and regression tasks. A\nlesser known property of tree-based methods is that one can construct a\nproximity matrix from the tree(s), and these proximity matrices are induced\nkernels. While there has been extensive research on the applications and\nproperties of kernels, there is relatively little research on kernels induced\nby decision forests. We construct Kernel Mean Embedding Random Forests (KMERF),\nwhich induce kernels from random trees and/or forests using leaf-node\nproximity. We introduce the notion of an asymptotically characteristic kernel,\nand prove that KMERF kernels are asymptotically characteristic for both\ndiscrete and continuous data. Because KMERF is data-adaptive, we suspected it\nwould outperform kernels selected a priori on finite sample data. We illustrate\nthat KMERF nearly dominates current state-of-the-art kernel-based tests across\na diverse range of high-dimensional two-sample and independence testing\nsettings. Furthermore, our forest-based approach is interpretable, and provides\nfeature importance metrics that readily distinguish important dimensions,\nunlike other high-dimensional non-parametric testing procedures. Hence, this\nwork demonstrates the decision forest-based kernel can be more powerful and\nmore interpretable than existing methods, flying in the face of conventional\nwisdom of the trade-off between the two.",

The existing regularization techniques mainly rely on\nthe i.i.d. assumption and only consider the knowledge from the current sample,\nwithout the leverage of the neighboring relationship between samples. In this\nwork, we propose a general regularizer called \\textbf{Patch-level Neighborhood\nInterpolation~(Pani)} that conducts a non-local representation in the\ncomputation of networks. Our proposal explicitly constructs patch-level graphs\nin different layers and then linearly interpolates neighborhood patch features,\nserving as a general and effective regularization strategy. Further, we\ncustomize our approach into two kinds of popular regularization methods, namely\nVirtual Adversarial Training (VAT) and MixUp as well as its variants. The first\nderived \\textbf{Pani VAT} presents a novel way to construct non-local\nadversarial smoothness by employing patch-level interpolated perturbations. The\nsecond derived \\textbf{Pani MixUp} method extends the MixUp, and achieves\nsuperiority over MixUp and competitive performance over state-of-the-art\nvariants of MixUp method with a significant advantage in computational\nefficiency.

          "description": "The growing penetration of intermittent, renewable generation in US power\ngrids, especially wind and solar generation, results in increased operational\nuncertainty. In that context, accurate forecasts are critical, especially for\nwind generation, which exhibits large variability and is historically harder to\npredict. To overcome this challenge, this work proposes a novel\nBundle-Predict-Reconcile (BPR) framework that integrates asset bundling,\nmachine learning, and forecast reconciliation techniques. The BPR framework\nfirst learns an intermediate hierarchy level (the bundles), then predicts wind\npower at the asset, bundle, and fleet level, and finally reconciles all\nforecasts to ensure consistency. This approach effectively introduces an\nauxiliary learning task (predicting the bundle-level time series) to help the\nmain learning tasks. The paper also introduces new asset-bundling criteria that\ncapture the spatio-temporal dynamics of wind power time series. Extensive\nnumerical experiments are conducted on an industry-size dataset of 283 wind\nfarms in the MISO footprint. The experiments consider short-term and day-ahead\nforecasts, and evaluates a large variety of forecasting models that include\nweather predictions as covariates. The results demonstrate the benefits of BPR,\nwhich consistently and significantly improves forecast accuracy over baselines,\nespecially at the fleet level.",

          "description": "Many real-world processes have complex tail dependence structures that cannot\nbe characterized using classical Gaussian processes. More flexible spatial\nextremes models exhibit appealing extremal dependence properties but are often\nexceedingly prohibitive to fit and simulate from in high dimensions. In this\npaper, we develop a new spatial extremes model that has flexible and\nnon-stationary dependence properties, and we integrate it in the\nencoding-decoding structure of a variational autoencoder (XVAE), whose\nparameters are estimated via variational Bayes combined with deep learning. The\nXVAE can be used as a spatio-temporal emulator that characterizes the\ndistribution of potential mechanistic model output states and produces outputs\nthat have the same statistical properties as the inputs, especially in the\ntail. As an aside, our approach also provides a novel way of making fast\ninference with complex extreme-value processes. Through extensive simulation\nstudies, we show that our XVAE is substantially more time-efficient than\ntraditional Bayesian inference while also outperforming many spatial extremes\nmodels with a stationary dependence structure. To further demonstrate the\ncomputational power of the XVAE, we analyze a high-resolution satellite-derived\ndataset of sea surface temperature in the Red Sea, which includes 30 years of\ndaily measurements at 16703 grid cells. We find that the extremal dependence\nstrength is weaker in the interior of Red Sea and it has decreased slightly\nover time.",

One such proposal uses $\\mu$P parameterized networks, where\nthe optimal hyperparameters for small width networks transfer to networks with\narbitrarily large width. However, in this scheme, hyperparameters do not\ntransfer across depths.

Furthermore, our empirical findings\nare supported and motivated by theory. Using recent developments in the\ndynamical mean field theory (DMFT) description of neural network learning\ndynamics, we show that this parameterization of ResNets admits a well-defined\nfeature learning joint infinite-width and infinite-depth limit and show\nconvergence of finite-size network dynamics towards this limit.",

In\nparticular, there is strong interest in unadjusted Langevin algorithms (ULA),\nwhich directly discretize Langevin dynamics to estimate expectations over the\ntarget distribution. We study the use of transport maps that approximately\nnormalize a target distribution as a way to precondition and accelerate the\nconvergence of Langevin dynamics. We show that in continuous time, when a\ntransport map is applied to Langevin dynamics, the result is a Riemannian\nmanifold Langevin dynamics (RMLD) with metric defined by the transport map. We\nalso show that applying a transport map to an irreversibly-perturbed ULA\nresults in a geometry-informed irreversible perturbation (GiIrr) of the\noriginal dynamics. These connections suggest more systematic ways of learning\nmetrics and perturbations, and also yield alternative discretizations of the\nRMLD described by the map, which we study. Under appropriate conditions, these\ndiscretized processes can be endowed with non-asymptotic bounds describing\nconvergence to the target distribution in 2-Wasserstein distance.

          "description": "The standard paired-sample testing approach in the multidimensional setting\napplies multiple univariate tests on the individual features, followed by\np-value adjustments. Such an approach suffers when the data carry numerous\nfeatures. A number of studies have shown that classification accuracy can be\nseen as a proxy for two-sample testing. However, neither theoretical\nfoundations nor practical recipes have been proposed so far on how this\nstrategy could be extended to multidimensional paired-sample testing. In this\nwork, we put forward the idea that scoring functions can be produced by the\ndecision rules defined by the perpendicular bisecting hyperplanes of the line\nsegments connecting each pair of instances. Then, the optimal scoring function\ncan be obtained by the pseudomedian of those rules, which we estimate by\nextending naturally the Hodges-Lehmann estimator. We accordingly propose a\nframework of a two-step testing procedure. First, we estimate the bisecting\nhyperplanes for each pair of instances and an aggregated rule derived through\nthe Hodges-Lehmann estimator. The paired samples are scored by this aggregated\nrule to produce a unidimensional representation. Second, we perform a Wilcoxon\nsigned-rank test on the obtained representation.

          "description": "Graphon estimation has been one of the most fundamental problems in network\nanalysis and has received considerable attention in the past decade. From the\nstatistical perspective, the minimax error rate of graphon estimation has been\nestablished by Gao et al (2015) for both stochastic block model (SBM) and\nnonparametric graphon estimation. The statistical optimal estimators are based\non constrained least squares and have computational complexity exponential in\nthe dimension. From the computational perspective, the best-known\npolynomial-time estimator is based on universal singular value thresholding\n(USVT), but it can only achieve a much slower estimation error rate than the\nminimax one. It is natural to wonder if such a gap is essential. The\ncomputational optimality of the USVT or the existence of a computational\nbarrier in graphon estimation has been a long-standing open problem. In this\nwork, we take the first step towards it and provide rigorous evidence for the\ncomputational barrier in graphon estimation via low-degree polynomials.\nSpecifically, in both SBM and nonparametric graphon estimation, we show that\nfor low-degree polynomial estimators, their estimation error rates cannot be\nsignificantly better than that of the USVT under a wide range of parameter\nregimes. Our results are proved based on the recent development of low-degree\npolynomials by Schramm and Wein (2022), while we overcome a few key challenges\nin applying it to the general graphon estimation problem. By leveraging our\nmain results, we also provide a computational lower bound on the clustering\nerror for community detection in SBM with a growing number of communities and\nthis yields a new piece of evidence for the conjectured Kesten-Stigum threshold\nfor efficient community recovery.",

However, existing\nSSL methods rely on a large unlabeled dataset, which may not always be\navailable in many real-world applications due to legal constraints (e.g.,\nGDPR). In this paper, we investigate the research question: Can we train SSL\nmodels without real unlabeled datasets? Instead of using real unlabeled\ndatasets, we propose an SSL method using synthetic datasets generated from\ngenerative foundation models trained on datasets containing millions of samples\nin diverse domains (e.g., ImageNet). Our main concepts are identifying\nsynthetic samples that emulate unlabeled samples from generative foundation\nmodels and training classifiers using these synthetic samples. To achieve this,\nour method is formulated as an alternating optimization problem: (i)\nmeta-learning of generative foundation models and (ii) SSL of classifiers using\nreal labeled and synthetic unlabeled samples. For (i), we propose a\nmeta-learning objective that optimizes latent variables to generate samples\nthat resemble real labeled samples and minimize the validation loss. For (ii),\nwe propose a simple unsupervised loss function that regularizes the feature\nextractors of classifiers to maximize the performance improvement obtained from\nsynthetic samples. We confirm that our method outperforms baselines using\ngenerative foundation models on SSL. We also demonstrate that our methods\noutperform SSL using real unlabeled datasets in scenarios with extremely small\namounts of labeled datasets.

          "description": "Batch reinforcement learning (RL) defines the task of learning from a fixed\nbatch of data lacking exhaustive exploration. Worst-case optimality algorithms,\nwhich calibrate a value-function model class from logged experience and perform\nsome type of pessimistic evaluation under the learned model, have emerged as a\npromising paradigm for batch RL. However, contemporary works on this stream\nhave commonly overlooked the hierarchical decision-making structure hidden in\nthe optimization landscape. In this paper, we adopt a game-theoretical\nviewpoint and model the policy learning diagram as a two-player general-sum\ngame with a leader-follower structure. We propose a novel stochastic\ngradient-based learning algorithm: StackelbergLearner, in which the leader\nplayer updates according to the total derivative of its objective instead of\nthe usual individual gradient, and the follower player makes individual updates\nand ensures transition-consistent pessimistic reasoning. The derived learning\ndynamic naturally lends StackelbergLearner to a game-theoretic interpretation\nand provides a convergence guarantee to differentiable Stackelberg equilibria.\nFrom a theoretical standpoint, we provide instance-dependent regret bounds with\ngeneral function approximation, which shows that our algorithm can learn a\nbest-effort policy that is able to compete against any comparator policy that\nis covered by batch data. Notably, our theoretical regret guarantees only\nrequire realizability without any data coverage and strong function\napproximation conditions, e.g., Bellman closedness, which is in contrast to\nprior works lacking such guarantees. Through comprehensive experiments, we find\nthat our algorithm consistently performs as well or better as compared to\nstate-of-the-art methods in batch RL benchmark and real-world datasets.",

          "description": "Contrastive learning is a self-supervised representation learning framework,\nwhere two positive views generated through data augmentation are made similar\nby an attraction force in a data representation space, while a repulsive force\nmakes them far from negative examples. Non-contrastive learning, represented by\nBYOL and SimSiam, further gets rid of negative examples and improves\ncomputational efficiency. While learned representations may collapse into a\nsingle point due to the lack of the repulsive force at first sight, Tian et al.\n(2021) revealed through the learning dynamics analysis that the representations\ncan avoid collapse if data augmentation is sufficiently stronger than\nregularization. However, their analysis does not take into account\ncommonly-used feature normalization, a normalizer before measuring the\nsimilarity of representations, and hence excessively strong regularization may\ncollapse the dynamics, which is an unnatural behavior under the presence of\nfeature normalization. Therefore, we extend the previous theory based on the L2\nloss by considering the cosine loss, which involves feature normalization. We\nshow that the cosine loss induces sixth-order dynamics (while the L2 loss\ninduces a third-order one), in which a stable equilibrium dynamically emerges\neven if there are only collapsed solutions with given initial parameters. Thus,\nwe offer a new understanding that feature normalization plays an important role\nin robustly preventing the dynamics collapse.",

Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) has\nemerged as a promising pathway towards AI alignment but brings forth challenges\ndue to its complexity and dependence on a separate reward model. Direct\nPreference Optimization (DPO) has been proposed as an alternative, and it\nremains equivalent to RLHF under the reverse KL regularization constraint. This\npaper presents $f$-DPO, a generalized approach to DPO by incorporating diverse\ndivergence constraints. We show that under certain $f$-divergences, including\nJensen-Shannon divergence, forward KL divergences and $\\alpha$-divergences, the\ncomplex relationship between the reward and optimal policy can also be\nsimplified by addressing the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker conditions. This eliminates the\nneed for estimating the normalizing constant in the Bradley-Terry model and\nenables a tractable mapping between the reward function and the optimal policy.\nOur approach optimizes LLMs to align with human preferences in a more efficient\nand supervised manner under a broad set of divergence constraints. Empirically,\nadopting these divergences ensures a balance between alignment performance and\ngeneration diversity.

          "description": "Variance in predictions across different trained models is a significant,\nunder-explored source of error in fair classification. In practice, the\nvariance on some data examples is so large that decisions can be effectively\narbitrary. To investigate this problem, we take an experimental approach and\nmake four overarching contributions: We 1) Define a metric called\nself-consistency, derived from variance, which we use as a proxy for measuring\nand reducing arbitrariness; 2) Develop an ensembling algorithm that abstains\nfrom classification when a prediction would be arbitrary; 3) Conduct the\nlargest to-date empirical study of the role of variance (vis-a-vis\nself-consistency and arbitrariness) in fair classification; and, 4) Release a\ntoolkit that makes the US Home Mortgage Disclosure Act (HMDA) datasets easily\nusable for future research. Altogether, our experiments reveal shocking\ninsights about the reliability of conclusions on benchmark datasets. Most\nfairness classification benchmarks are close-to-fair when taking into account\nthe amount of arbitrariness present in predictions -- before we even try to\napply common fairness interventions. This finding calls into question the\npractical utility of common algorithmic fairness methods, and in turn suggests\nthat we should fundamentally reconsider how we choose to measure fairness in\nmachine learning.",

          "description": "While reliable data-driven decision-making hinges on high-quality labeled\ndata, the acquisition of quality labels often involves laborious human\nannotations or slow and expensive scientific measurements. Machine learning is\nbecoming an appealing alternative as sophisticated predictive techniques are\nbeing used to quickly and cheaply produce large amounts of predicted labels;\ne.g., predicted protein structures are used to supplement experimentally\nderived structures, predictions of socioeconomic indicators from satellite\nimagery are used to supplement accurate survey data, and so on. Since\npredictions are imperfect and potentially biased, this practice brings into\nquestion the validity of downstream inferences. We introduce cross-prediction:\na method for valid inference powered by machine learning. With a small labeled\ndataset and a large unlabeled dataset, cross-prediction imputes the missing\nlabels via machine learning and applies a form of debiasing to remedy the\nprediction inaccuracies. The resulting inferences achieve the desired error\nprobability and are more powerful than those that only leverage the labeled\ndata. Closely related is the recent proposal of prediction-powered inference,\nwhich assumes that a good pre-trained model is already available. We show that\ncross-prediction is consistently more powerful than an adaptation of\nprediction-powered inference in which a fraction of the labeled data is split\noff and used to train the model. Finally, we observe that cross-prediction\ngives more stable conclusions than its competitors; its confidence intervals\ntypically have significantly lower variability.",

          "description": "We study differentially private (DP) stochastic optimization (SO) with loss\nfunctions whose worst-case Lipschitz parameter over all data points may be\nextremely large. To date, the vast majority of work on DP SO assumes that the\nloss is uniformly Lipschitz continuous over data (i.e. stochastic gradients are\nuniformly bounded over all data points). While this assumption is convenient,\nit often leads to pessimistic excess risk bounds. In many practical problems,\nthe worst-case (uniform) Lipschitz parameter of the loss over all data points\nmay be extremely large due to outliers. In such cases, the error bounds for DP\nSO, which scale with the worst-case Lipschitz parameter of the loss, are\nvacuous. To address these limitations, this work provides near-optimal excess\nrisk bounds that do not depend on the uniform Lipschitz parameter of the loss.\nBuilding on a recent line of work (Wang et al., 2020; Kamath et al., 2022), we\nassume that stochastic gradients have bounded $k$-th order moments for some $k\n\\geq 2$. Compared with works on uniformly Lipschitz DP SO, our excess risk\nscales with the $k$-th moment bound instead of the uniform Lipschitz parameter\nof the loss, allowing for significantly faster rates in the presence of\noutliers and/or heavy-tailed data. For convex and strongly convex loss\nfunctions, we provide the first asymptotically optimal excess risk bounds (up\nto a logarithmic factor). In contrast to (Wang et al., 2020; Kamath et al.,\n2022), our bounds do not require the loss function to be differentiable/smooth.\nWe also devise a linear-time algorithm for smooth losses that has excess risk\nthat is tight in certain practical parameter regimes. Additionally, our work is\nthe first to address non-convex non-uniformly Lipschitz loss functions\nsatisfying the Proximal-PL inequality; this covers some practical machine\nlearning models. Our Proximal-PL algorithm has near-optimal excess risk.",

Similar to the classical setup, the agent\nreceives rewards generated independently from the distribution of the arm\nchosen at each time. However, these rewards are not directly observed. Instead,\nwith a fixed $\\varepsilon\\in (0,\\frac{1}{2})$, the agent observes a sample from\nthe chosen arm's distribution with probability $1-\\varepsilon$, or from an\narbitrary corruption distribution with probability $\\varepsilon$. Importantly,\nwe impose no assumptions on these corruption distributions, which can be\nunbounded. In this setting, accommodating potentially unbounded corruptions, we\nestablish a problem-dependent lower bound on regret for a given family of arm\ndistributions. We introduce CRIMED, an asymptotically-optimal algorithm that\nachieves the exact lower bound on regret for bandits with Gaussian\ndistributions with known variance. Additionally, we provide a finite-sample\nanalysis of CRIMED's regret performance. Notably, CRIMED can effectively handle\ncorruptions with $\\varepsilon$ values as high as $\\frac{1}{2}$. Furthermore, we\ndevelop a tight concentration result for medians in the presence of arbitrary\ncorruptions, even with $\\varepsilon$ values up to $\\frac{1}{2}$, which may be\nof independent interest.

          "description": "Recently, studies on machine learning have focused on methods that use\nsymmetry implicit in a specific manifold as an inductive bias. Grassmann\nmanifolds provide the ability to handle fundamental shapes represented as shape\nspaces, enabling stable shape analysis. In this paper, we present a novel\napproach in which we establish the theoretical foundations for learning\ndistributions on the Grassmann manifold via continuous normalization flows,\nwith the explicit goal of generating stable shapes. Our approach facilitates\nmore robust generation by effectively eliminating the influence of extraneous\ntransformations, such as rotations and inversions, through learning and\ngenerating within a Grassmann manifolds designed to accommodate the essential\nshape information of the object. The experimental results indicated that the\nproposed method can generate high-quality samples by capturing the data\nstructure. Furthermore, the proposed method significantly outperformed\nstate-of-the-art methods in terms of the log-likelihood or evidence lower\nbound. The results obtained are expected to stimulate further research in this\nfield, leading to advances for stable shape generation and analysis.",

          "description": "Sequential change detection is a classical problem with a variety of\napplications. However, the majority of prior work has been parametric, for\nexample, focusing on exponential families. We develop a fundamentally new and\ngeneral framework for sequential change detection when the pre- and post-change\ndistributions are nonparametrically specified (and thus composite). Our\nprocedures come with clean, nonasymptotic bounds on the average run length\n(frequency of false alarms). In certain nonparametric cases (like sub-Gaussian\nor sub-exponential), we also provide near-optimal bounds on the detection delay\nfollowing a changepoint. The primary technical tool that we introduce is called\nan \\emph{e-detector}, which is composed of sums of e-processes -- a fundamental\ngeneralization of nonnegative supermartingales -- that are started at\nconsecutive times. We first introduce simple Shiryaev-Roberts and CUSUM-style\ne-detectors, and then show how to design their mixtures in order to achieve\nboth statistical and computational efficiency. Our e-detector framework can be\ninstantiated to recover classical likelihood-based procedures for parametric\nproblems, as well as yielding the first change detection method for many\nnonparametric problems. As a running example, we tackle the problem of\ndetecting changes in the mean of a bounded random variable without i.i.d.\nassumptions, with an application to tracking the performance of a basketball\nteam over multiple seasons.",

          "description": "Recent years have seen significant activity on the problem of using data for\nthe purpose of learning properties of quantum systems or of processing\nclassical or quantum data via quantum computing. As in classical learning,\nquantum learning problems involve settings in which the mechanism generating\nthe data is unknown, and the main goal of a learning algorithm is to ensure\nsatisfactory accuracy levels when only given access to data and, possibly, side\ninformation such as expert knowledge. This article reviews the complexity of\nquantum learning using information-theoretic techniques by focusing on data\ncomplexity, copy complexity, and model complexity. Copy complexity arises from\nthe destructive nature of quantum measurements, which irreversibly alter the\nstate to be processed, limiting the information that can be extracted about\nquantum data. For example, in a quantum system, unlike in classical machine\nlearning, it is generally not possible to evaluate the training loss\nsimultaneously on multiple hypotheses using the same quantum data. To make the\npaper self-contained and approachable by different research communities, we\nprovide extensive background material on classical results from statistical\nlearning theory, as well as on the distinguishability of quantum states.\nThroughout, we highlight the differences between quantum and classical learning\nby addressing both supervised and unsupervised learning, and we provide\nextensive pointers to the literature.",

          "description": "Structure learning is the crux of causal inference. Notably, causal discovery\n(CD) algorithms are brittle when data is scarce, possibly inferring imprecise\ncausal relations that contradict expert knowledge -- especially when\nconsidering latent confounders. To aggravate the issue, most CD methods do not\nprovide uncertainty estimates, making it hard for users to interpret results\nand improve the inference process. Surprisingly, while CD is a human-centered\naffair, no works have focused on building methods that both 1) output\nuncertainty estimates that can be verified by experts and 2) interact with\nthose experts to iteratively refine CD. To solve these issues, we start by\nproposing to sample (causal) ancestral graphs proportionally to a belief\ndistribution based on a score function, such as the Bayesian information\ncriterion (BIC), using generative flow networks. Then, we leverage the\ndiversity in candidate graphs and introduce an optimal experimental design to\niteratively probe the expert about the relations among variables, effectively\nreducing the uncertainty of our belief over ancestral graphs. Finally, we\nupdate our samples to incorporate human feedback via importance sampling.\nImportantly, our method does not require causal sufficiency (i.e., unobserved\nconfounders may exist).

Bayesian sparsification for deep learning emerges as a crucial\napproach, facilitating the design of models that are both computationally\nefficient and competitive in terms of performance across various deep learning\napplications. The state-of-the-art -- in Bayesian sparsification of deep neural\nnetworks -- combines structural shrinkage priors on model weights with an\napproximate inference scheme based on black-box stochastic variational\ninference. However, model inversion of the full generative model is\nexceptionally computationally demanding, especially when compared to standard\ndeep learning of point estimates. In this context, we advocate for the use of\nBayesian model reduction (BMR) as a more efficient alternative for pruning of\nmodel weights. As a generalization of the Savage-Dickey ratio, BMR allows a\npost-hoc elimination of redundant model weights based on the posterior\nestimates under a straightforward (non-hierarchical) generative model. Our\ncomparative study highlights the computational efficiency and the pruning rate\nof the BMR method relative to the established stochastic variational inference\n(SVI) scheme, when applied to the full hierarchical generative model.

          "description": "Monte Carlo (MC) approximation has been used as the standard computation\napproach for the Sliced Wasserstein (SW) distance, which has an intractable\nexpectation in its analytical form. However, the MC method is not optimal in\nterms of minimizing the absolute approximation error. To provide a better class\nof empirical SW, we propose quasi-sliced Wasserstein (QSW) approximations that\nrely on Quasi-Monte Carlo (QMC) methods. For a comprehensive investigation of\nQMC for SW, we focus on the 3D setting, specifically computing the SW between\nprobability measures in three dimensions. In greater detail, we empirically\nverify various ways of constructing QMC points sets on the 3D unit-hypersphere,\nincluding Gaussian-based mapping, equal area mapping, generalized spiral\npoints, and optimizing discrepancy energies. Furthermore, to obtain an unbiased\nestimation for stochastic optimization, we extend QSW into Randomized\nQuasi-Sliced Wasserstein (RQSW) by introducing randomness to the discussed\nlow-discrepancy sequences. For theoretical properties, we prove the asymptotic\nconvergence of QSW and the unbiasedness of RQSW. Finally, we conduct\nexperiments on various 3D tasks, such as point-cloud comparison, point-cloud\ninterpolation, image style transfer, and training deep point-cloud\nautoencoders, to demonstrate the favorable performance of the proposed QSW and\nRQSW variants.",

          "description": "Modern deep networks are trained with stochastic gradient descent (SGD) whose\nkey parameters are the number of data considered at each step or batch size\n$B$, and the step size or learning rate $\\eta$. For small $B$ and large $\\eta$,\nSGD corresponds to a stochastic evolution of the parameters, whose noise\namplitude is governed by the `temperature' $T\\equiv \\eta/B$. Yet this\ndescription is observed to break down for sufficiently large batches $B\\geq\nB^*$, or simplifies to gradient descent (GD) when the temperature is\nsufficiently small. Understanding where these cross-overs take place remains a\ncentral challenge. Here we resolve these questions for a teacher-student\nperceptron classification model, and show empirically that our key predictions\nstill apply to deep networks. Specifically, we obtain a phase diagram in the\n$B$-$\\eta$ plane that separates three dynamical phases: $\\textit{(i)}$ a\nnoise-dominated SGD governed by temperature, $\\textit{(ii)}$ a\nlarge-first-step-dominated SGD and $\\textit{(iii)}$ GD. These different phases\nalso corresponds to different regimes of generalization error. Remarkably, our\nanalysis reveals that the batch size $B^*$ separating regimes $\\textit{(i)}$\nand $\\textit{(ii)}$ scale with the size $P$ of the training set, with an\nexponent that characterizes the hardness of the classification problem.",

          "description": "Generalized Additive Models (GAMs) are widely used explainable-by-design\nmodels in various applications. GAMs assume that the output can be represented\nas a sum of univariate functions, referred to as components. However, this\nassumption fails in ML problems where the output depends on multiple features\nsimultaneously. In these cases, GAMs fail to capture the interaction terms of\nthe underlying function, leading to subpar accuracy. To (partially) address\nthis issue, we propose Regionally Additive Models (RAMs), a novel class of\nexplainable-by-design models. RAMs identify subregions within the feature space\nwhere interactions are minimized. Within these regions, it is more accurate to\nexpress the output as a sum of univariate functions (components). Consequently,\nRAMs fit one component per subregion of each feature instead of one component\nper feature. This approach yields a more expressive model compared to GAMs\nwhile retaining interpretability. The RAM framework consists of three steps.\nFirstly, we train a black-box model. Secondly, using Regional Effect Plots, we\nidentify subregions where the black-box model exhibits near-local additivity.\nLastly, we fit a GAM component for each identified subregion. We validate the\neffectiveness of RAMs through experiments on both synthetic and real-world\ndatasets. The results confirm that RAMs offer improved expressiveness compared\nto GAMs while maintaining interpretability.",

          "description": "In the Variational Autoencoder (VAE), the variational posterior often aligns\nclosely with the prior, which is known as posterior collapse and hinders the\nquality of representation learning. To mitigate this problem, an adjustable\nhyperparameter beta has been introduced in the VAE. This paper presents a\nclosed-form expression to assess the relationship between the beta in VAE, the\ndataset size, the posterior collapse, and the rate-distortion curve by\nanalyzing a minimal VAE in a high-dimensional limit. These results clarify that\na long plateau in the generalization error emerges with a relatively larger\nbeta. As the beta increases, the length of the plateau extends and then becomes\ninfinite beyond a certain beta threshold. This implies that the choice of beta,\nunlike the usual regularization parameters, can induce posterior collapse\nregardless of the dataset size. Thus, beta is a risky parameter that requires\ncareful tuning. Furthermore, considering the dataset-size dependence on the\nrate-distortion curve, a relatively large dataset is required to obtain a\nrate-distortion curve with high rates. Extensive numerical experiments support\nour analysis.",

          "description": "Tens of thousands of simultaneous hypothesis tests are routinely performed in\ngenomic studies to identify differentially expressed genes. However, due to\nunmeasured confounders, many standard statistical approaches may be\nsubstantially biased. This paper investigates the large-scale hypothesis\ntesting problem for multivariate generalized linear models in the presence of\nconfounding effects. Under arbitrary confounding mechanisms, we propose a\nunified statistical estimation and inference framework that harnesses\northogonal structures and integrates linear projections into three key stages.\nIt first leverages multivariate responses to separate marginal and uncorrelated\nconfounding effects, recovering the confounding coefficients' column space.\nSubsequently, latent factors and primary effects are jointly estimated,\nutilizing $\\ell_1$-regularization for sparsity while imposing orthogonality\nonto confounding coefficients. Finally, we incorporate projected and weighted\nbias-correction steps for hypothesis testing. Theoretically, we establish\nvarious effects' identification conditions and non-asymptotic error bounds. We\nshow effective Type-I error control of asymptotic $z$-tests as sample and\nresponse sizes approach infinity. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the\nproposed method controls the false discovery rate by the Benjamini-Hochberg\nprocedure and is more powerful than alternative methods. By comparing\nsingle-cell RNA-seq counts from two groups of samples, we demonstrate the\nsuitability of adjusting confounding effects when significant covariates are\nabsent from the model.",

          "description": "In many randomized experiments, the treatment effect of the long-term metric\n(i.e. the primary outcome of interest) is often difficult or infeasible to\nmeasure. Such long-term metrics are often slow to react to changes and\nsufficiently noisy they are challenging to faithfully estimate in short-horizon\nexperiments. A common alternative is to measure several short-term proxy\nmetrics in the hope they closely track the long-term metric -- so they can be\nused to effectively guide decision-making in the near-term. We introduce a new\nstatistical framework to both define and construct an optimal proxy metric for\nuse in a homogeneous population of randomized experiments. Our procedure first\nreduces the construction of an optimal proxy metric in a given experiment to a\nportfolio optimization problem which depends on the true latent treatment\neffects and noise level of experiment under consideration. We then denoise the\nobserved treatment effects of the long-term metric and a set of proxies in a\nhistorical corpus of randomized experiments to extract estimates of the latent\ntreatment effects for use in the optimization problem. One key insight derived\nfrom our approach is that the optimal proxy metric for a given experiment is\nnot apriori fixed; rather it should depend on the sample size (or effective\nnoise level) of the randomized experiment for which it is deployed. To\ninstantiate and evaluate our framework, we employ our methodology in a large\ncorpus of randomized experiments from an industrial recommendation system and\nconstruct proxy metrics that perform favorably relative to several baselines.",

In the theoretical analysis,\nwe provide a condition for the choice of the kernel which guarantees no\nspecification error that biases the lower bound estimation. Furthermore, we\nprovide consistency guarantees of policy evaluation and learning. In the\nexperiments with synthetic and real-world data, we demonstrate the\neffectiveness of the proposed method.",

In geometric quantum machine learning,\none achieves this by encoding group structure into parameterised quantum\ncircuits to include the symmetries of a problem as an inductive bias. However,\nconstructing such circuits is challenging as a concrete guiding principle has\nyet to emerge. In this paper, we propose the use of spin networks, a form of\ndirected tensor network invariant under a group transformation, to devise SU(2)\nequivariant quantum circuit ans\\\"atze -- circuits possessing spin rotation\nsymmetry. By changing to the basis that block diagonalises SU(2) group action,\nthese networks provide a natural building block for constructing parameterised\nequivariant quantum circuits. We prove that our construction is mathematically\nequivalent to other known constructions, such as those based on twirling and\ngeneralised permutations, but more direct to implement on quantum hardware. The\nefficacy of our constructed circuits is tested by solving the ground state\nproblem of SU(2) symmetric Heisenberg models on the one-dimensional triangular\nlattice and on the Kagome lattice. Our results highlight that our equivariant\ncircuits boost the performance of quantum variational algorithms, indicating\nbroader applicability to other real-world problems.",

We study the prevalent setting where the number of\nfeatures and samples are both large and comparable. In this context,\nstate-of-the-art debiasing technology uses a degrees-of-freedom correction to\nremove shrinkage bias of regularized estimators and conduct inference. However,\nthis method requires that the observed samples are i.i.d., the covariates\nfollow a mean zero Gaussian distribution, and reliable covariance matrix\nestimates for observed features are available. This approach struggles when (i)\ncovariates are non-Gaussian with heavy tails or asymmetric distributions, (ii)\nrows of the design exhibit heterogeneity or dependencies, and (iii) reliable\nfeature covariance estimates are lacking.\n\nTo address these, we develop a new strategy where the debiasing correction is\na rescaled gradient descent step (suitably initialized) with step size\ndetermined by the spectrum of the sample covariance matrix. Unlike prior work,\nwe assume that eigenvectors of this matrix are uniform draws from the\northogonal group. We show this assumption remains valid in diverse situations\nwhere traditional debiasing fails, including designs with complex row-column\ndependencies, heavy tails, asymmetric properties, and latent low-rank\nstructures. We establish asymptotic normality of our proposed estimator\n(centered and scaled) under various convergence notions. Moreover, we develop a\nconsistent estimator for its asymptotic variance.

While optimal treatment\nrules can maximize causal outcomes across the population, access parity\nconstraints or other fairness considerations can be relevant in the case of\nencouragement. For example, in social services, a persistent puzzle is the gap\nin take-up of beneficial services among those who may benefit from them the\nmost. When in addition the decision-maker has distributional preferences over\nboth access and average outcomes, the optimal decision rule changes. We study\ncausal identification, statistical variance-reduced estimation, and robust\nestimation of optimal treatment rules, including under potential violations of\npositivity. We consider fairness constraints such as demographic parity in\ntreatment take-up, and other constraints, via constrained optimization. Our\nframework can be extended to handle algorithmic recommendations under an\noften-reasonable covariate-conditional exclusion restriction, using our\nrobustness checks for lack of positivity in the recommendation. We develop a\ntwo-stage algorithm for solving over parametrized policy classes under general\nconstraints to obtain variance-sensitive regret bounds. We illustrate the\nmethods in two case studies based on data from randomized encouragement to\nenroll in insurance and from pretrial supervised release with electronic\nmonitoring.",

Target Networks are employed to\nstabilize training by using an additional set of lagging parameters to estimate\nthe target values. Despite the popularity of Target Networks, their effect on\nthe optimization is still misunderstood. In this work, we show that they act as\nan implicit regularizer which can be beneficial in some cases, but also have\ndisadvantages such as being inflexible and can result in instabilities, even\nwhen vanilla TD(0) converges. To overcome these issues, we propose an explicit\nFunctional Regularization alternative that is flexible and a convex regularizer\nin function space and we theoretically study its convergence. We conduct an\nexperimental study across a range of environments, discount factors, and\noff-policiness data collections to investigate the effectiveness of the\nregularization induced by Target Networks and Functional Regularization in\nterms of performance, accuracy, and stability. Our findings emphasize that\nFunctional Regularization can be used as a drop-in replacement for Target\nNetworks and result in performance improvement. Furthermore, adjusting both the\nregularization weight and the network update period in Functional\nRegularization can result in further performance improvements compared to\nsolely adjusting the network update period as typically done with Target\nNetworks. Our approach also enhances the ability to networks to recover\naccurate $Q$-values.",

          "description": "The minimum sum-of-squares clustering (MSSC), or k-means type clustering, has\nbeen recently extended to exploit prior knowledge on the cardinality of each\ncluster. Such knowledge is used to increase performance as well as solution\nquality. In this paper, we propose a global optimization approach based on the\nbranch-and-cut technique to solve the cardinality-constrained MSSC. For the\nlower bound routine, we use the semidefinite programming (SDP) relaxation\nrecently proposed by Rujeerapaiboon et al. [SIAM J. Optim. 29(2), 1211-1239,\n(2019)]. However, this relaxation can be used in a branch-and-cut method only\nfor small-size instances. Therefore, we derive a new SDP relaxation that scales\nbetter with the instance size and the number of clusters. In both cases, we\nstrengthen the bound by adding polyhedral cuts. Benefiting from a tailored\nbranching strategy which enforces pairwise constraints, we reduce the\ncomplexity of the problems arising in the children nodes. For the upper bound,\ninstead, we present a local search procedure that exploits the solution of the\nSDP relaxation solved at each node. Computational results show that the\nproposed algorithm globally solves, for the first time, real-world instances of\nsize 10 times larger than those solved by state-of-the-art exact methods.",

Instead of using estimation procedure based\non truncated observed data, we choose the optimizer by minimizing the risk\nvalue. Those risk values can be robustly estimated via using the remarkable\nCatoni's method (Catoni, 2012). Thanks to the structure of Catoni-type\ninfluence functions, we are able to establish excess risk upper bounds via\nusing generalized generic chaining methods.

In this work, we investigate the effect of a spiked\ncovariance structure and reveal several interesting phenomena. First, we show\nthat in the anisotropic setting, the commonly used spherical gradient dynamics\nmay fail to recover the true direction, even when the spike is perfectly\naligned with the target direction. Next, we show that appropriate weight\nnormalization that is reminiscent of batch normalization can alleviate this\nissue. Further, by exploiting the alignment between the (spiked) input\ncovariance and the target, we obtain improved sample complexity compared to the\nisotropic case. In particular, under the spiked model with a suitably large\nspike, the sample complexity of gradient-based training can be made independent\nof the information exponent while also outperforming lower bounds for\nrotationally invariant kernel methods.",

To explicitly embed the\nteacher's knowledge in feature transform, we propose a learnable KD layer for\nthe student which improves KD with two distinct abilities: i) learning how to\nleverage the teacher's knowledge, enabling to discard nuisance information, and\nii) feeding forward the transferred knowledge deeper.

          "description": "This work investigates the nuanced algorithm design choices for deep learning\nin the presence of computational-statistical gaps. We begin by considering\noffline sparse parity learning, a supervised classification problem which\nadmits a statistical query lower bound for gradient-based training of a\nmultilayer perceptron. This lower bound can be interpreted as a multi-resource\ntradeoff frontier: successful learning can only occur if one is sufficiently\nrich (large model), knowledgeable (large dataset), patient (many training\niterations), or lucky (many random guesses). We show, theoretically and\nexperimentally, that sparse initialization and increasing network width yield\nsignificant improvements in sample efficiency in this setting. Here, width\nplays the role of parallel search: it amplifies the probability of finding\n\"lottery ticket\" neurons, which learn sparse features more sample-efficiently.\nFinally, we show that the synthetic sparse parity task can be useful as a proxy\nfor real problems requiring axis-aligned feature learning. We demonstrate\nimproved sample efficiency on tabular classification benchmarks by using wide,\nsparsely-initialized MLP models; these networks sometimes outperform tuned\nrandom forests.",

          "description": "We introduce the $ARMOR_D$ methods as novel approaches to enhancing the\nadversarial robustness of deep learning models. These methods are based on a\nnew class of optimal-transport-regularized divergences, constructed via an\ninfimal convolution between an information divergence and an optimal-transport\n(OT) cost. We use these as tools to enhance adversarial robustness by\nmaximizing the expected loss over a neighborhood of distributions, a technique\nknown as distributionally robust optimization. Viewed as a tool for\nconstructing adversarial samples, our method allows samples to be both\ntransported, according to the OT cost, and re-weighted, according to the\ninformation divergence. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on\nmalware detection and image recognition applications and find that, to our\nknowledge, it outperforms existing methods at enhancing the robustness against\nadversarial attacks. $ARMOR_D$ yields the robustified accuracy of $98.29\\%$\nagainst $FGSM$ and $98.18\\%$ against $PGD^{40}$ on the MNIST dataset, reducing\nthe error rate by more than $19.7\\%$ and $37.2\\%$ respectively compared to\nprior methods.

This didn't make sense since the models should focus on foreground objects.\n By analyzing the output embeddings, they found a small number of tokens (2%) had super high vector norms, causing the spikes.\n The high-norm \"outlier\" tokens occurred in redundant areas and held less local info but more global info about the image.\n Their hypothesis is that ViTs learn to identify unimportant patches and recycle them as temporary storage instead of discarding. This enables efficient processing but causes issues.\n Their fix is simple - just add dedicated \"register\" tokens that provide storage space, avoiding the recycling side effects.\n Models trained with registers have:\n  \nSmoother and more meaningful attention maps\n Small boosts in downstream performance\n Way better object discovery abilities\n  \nThe registers give ViTs a place to do their temporary computations without messing stuff up.

In contrast to e.g. the brain which is essentially a directed graph most networks utilized nowerdays use a feed forward approach. E.g. transformers are able to attend to past tokens, but generate the tokens in a way where for a given token a given weight is not utilized at different stages in the feed forward pass. In my intuition this would lead to an issue where concepts (factual data as well as learned \"algorithms\") might be duplicated as they are needed at different depths in the generation process and are sequentially dependent on one another. This does not directly make the model less capable, as it might learn the same concept at two layers sufficiently well, but it reduces the data and parameter efficiency and and might impact generalization capabilities. Using a full on brain like graph might be hard to implement/optimize/scale on current hardware and is tricky with the backprop. But is there any work on duplicating a few layers, placing them at different depths in large models. I would guess that this would be more impactful for large models.

          "description": "Project Page\n Paper\n Code \n  \nIn this paper, we present Gaussian Splatting based text-to-3D generation (GSGEN), a novel approach for generating high-quality 3D objects. Previous methods suffer from inaccurate geometry and limited fidelity due to the absence of 3D prior and proper representation. We leverage 3D Gaussian Splatting, a recent state-of-the-art representation, to address existing shortcomings by exploiting the explicit nature that enables the incorporation of 3D prior. Specifically, our method adopts a progressive optimization strategy, which includes a geometry optimization stage and an appearance refinement stage. In geometry optimization, a coarse representation is established under a 3D geometry prior along with the ordinary 2D SDS loss, ensuring a sensible and 3D-consistent rough shape. Subsequently, the obtained Gaussians undergo an iterative refinement to enrich details. In this stage, we increase the number of Gaussians by compactness-based densification to enhance continuity and improve fidelity. With these designs, our approach can generate 3D content with delicate details and more accurate geometry. Extensive evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, especially for capturing high-frequency components.\n  \n   submitted by    /u/Sirisian  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hi! I just open-sourced a project that I've been working on for a while and wanted to see what you think!\n The goal of Carton (https://carton.run) is to let you use a single interface to run any machine learning model from any programming language.\n It’s currently difficult to integrate models that use different technologies (e.g. TensorRT, Ludwig, TorchScript, JAX, GGML, etc) into your application, especially if you’re not using Python. Even if you learn the details of integrating each of these frameworks, running multiple frameworks in one process can cause hard-to-debug crashes.\n Ideally, the ML framework a model was developed in should just be an implementation detail. Carton lets you decouple your application from specific ML frameworks so you can focus on the problem you actually want to solve.\n At a high level, the way Carton works is by running models in their own processes and using an IPC system to communicate back and forth with low overhead. Carton is primarily implemented in Rust, with bindings to other languages. There are lots more details linked in the architecture doc below.\n Importantly, Carton uses your model’s original underlying framework (e.g. PyTorch) under the hood to actually execute the model. This is meaningful because it makes Carton composable with other technologies. For example, it’s easy to use custom ops, TensorRT, etc without changes. This lets you keep up with cutting-edge advances, but decouples them from your application.\n I’ve been working on Carton for almost a year now and I open sourced it on Wednesday!\n Some useful links:\n  \nWebsite, docs, quickstart - https://carton.run\n Explore existing models - https://carton.pub\n Repo - https://github.com/VivekPanyam/carton\n Architecture - https://github.com/VivekPanyam/carton/blob/main/ARCHITECTURE.md\n  \nPlease let me know what you think!\n    submitted by    /u/vpanyam  \n [link]   [comments]",

In this work, we propose RealFill, a novel generative approach for image completion that fills in missing regions of an image with the content that should have been there. RealFill is a generative inpainting model that is personalized using only a few reference images of a scene. These reference images do not have to be aligned with the target image, and can be taken with drastically varying viewpoints, lighting conditions, camera apertures, or image styles. Once personalized, RealFill is able to complete a target image with visually compelling contents that are faithful to the original scene. We evaluate RealFill on a new image completion benchmark that covers a set of diverse and challenging scenarios, and find that it outperforms existing approaches by a large margin.\n  \n​\n    submitted by    /u/StrawberryNumberNine  \n [link]   [comments]",

Model M is a UNet, so I can incorporate this task simply with an additional output channel in the last layer. \n I add dataset B for object segmentation. During training, M learns on both datasets quite well, which suggests to me that the tasks are well-aligned.

Yet the validation performance is consistently higher when I train on both datasets. \n The only explanation I can think of is the double descent phenomenon.

This retains alignment with text descriptions.\n Latent diffusion then serves as a super-resolution expert, upsampling efficiently while preserving fidelity.\n  \nBy blending complementary techniques, Show-1 moves past tradeoffs limiting the individual models.\n More details here.

While recent progress enables creating short clips, smoothly transitioning across diverse events and maintaining continuity remains difficult.\n A new paper from UNC Chapel Hill proposes VIDEODIRECTORGPT, a two-stage framework attempting to address multi-scene video generation:\n Here are my highlights from the paper:\n  \nTwo-stage approach: first a language model generates detailed \"video plan\", then a video generation module renders scenes based on the plan\n Video plan contains multi-scene descriptions, entities/layouts, backgrounds, consistency groupings - guides downstream video generation\n Video generation module called Layout2Vid trained on images, adds spatial layout control and cross-scene consistency to existing text-to-video model\n Experiments show improved object layout/control in single-scene videos vs baselines\n Multi-scene videos display higher object consistency across scenes compared to baselines\n Competitive open-domain video generation performance maintained\n  \nThe key innovation seems to be using a large language model to plot detailed video plans to guide overall video generation. And the video generator Layout2Vid adds better spatial and temporal control through some clever tweaks. The separation of these tasks seems to matter.\n You can read my full summary here.

Furthermore, he adds that before Feature Scaling, you might do Feature Transformation (Log, Square,...) in order to make your data look normal and have better models. How true do you think this statement is? Do you also transform your feature, and then scale them? How often do you do it?

          "description": "Researchers from Microsoft have just proposed using a psychological assessment tool called the Defining Issues Test (DIT) to evaluate the moral reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) like GPT-3, ChatGPT, etc.\n The DIT presents moral dilemmas and has subjects rate and rank the importance of various ethical considerations related to the dilemma. It allows quantifying the sophistication of moral thinking through a P-score.\n In this new paper, the researchers tested prominent LLMs with adapted DIT prompts containing AI-relevant moral scenarios.\n Key findings:\n  \nLarge models like GPT-3 failed to comprehend prompts and scored near random baseline in moral reasoning.\n ChatGPT, Text-davinci-003 and GPT-4 showed coherent moral reasoning with above-random P-scores.\n Surprisingly, the smaller 70B LlamaChat model outscored larger models in its P-score, demonstrating advanced ethics understanding is possible without massive parameters.\n The models operated mostly at intermediate conventional levels as per Kohlberg's moral development theory. No model exhibited highly mature moral reasoning.\n  \nI think this is an interesting framework to evaluate and improve LLMs' moral intelligence before deploying them into sensitive real-world environments - to the extent that a model can be said to possess moral intelligence (or, seem to possess it?).\n Here's a link to my full summary with a lot more background on Kohlberg's model (had to read up on it since I didn't study psych).

To avoid training models on erroneous data and save QA teams significant time, you can now use automated algorithms invented by our scientists.\n Our newest paper introduces Cleanlab Object Detection: a novel algorithm to assess label quality in any object detection dataset and catch errors (named ObjectLab for short). Extensive benchmarks show Cleanlab Object Detection identifies mislabeled images with better precision/recall than other approaches. When applied to the famous COCO dataset, Cleanlab Object Detection automatically discovers hundreds of mislabeled images, including errors where annotators mistakenly: overlooked an object that should’ve had a bounding box, sloppily drew a box in a poor location, or chose the wrong class label for an annotated object.\n We’ve open-sourced one line of code to find errors in any object detection dataset via Cleanlab Object Detection, which can utilize any existing object detection model you’ve trained. \n For those interested, you can check out the 5-minute tutorial to get started and the blog to read the details.\n    submitted by    /u/jonas__m  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Training giant AI models like GPT-3 requires large resources - thousands of GPUs running for months. As a solo researcher without access to that kind of scale, I can't easily reproduce experiments and findings from papers on huge models.\n But a new paper from DeepMind shows you can recreate and study training instabilities seen in massive models by using small ones.\n The key is increasing the learning rate:\n  \nThis reproduces \"attention collapse\" where the model focuses on just a few tokens, like overfitting.\n Also can reproduce \"logit divergence\" where output values drift unstably.\n  \nThese issues have been reported when scaling up to billions of params. The cool part is techniques that fix them for giant models also work for small models:\n  \nqk-layernorm prevents attention collapse.\n Adding a \"z-loss\" term stops logit divergence.\n  \nSome other highlights from the paper include:\n  \nLonger warmup helps stability, especially for bigger models.\n Decoupling LR and weight decay improves stability.\n Depth increases sensitivity much faster than width.\n Can predict upcoming issues from scaling trends.\n Default epsilon hurts at large scale.\n  \nIf the authors are right, one more tool that lets researchers study and even help train giant models without Google-size resources. Small models can guide large model development, sort of like how you can build a scale train set to study and improve how a railroad system works... for a lot less money than starting your own railroad company, buying land, building real tracks, etc.\n Full summary.

The initial $20M round was led by Nat Friedman, Danial Gross, Patrick Collision, Tobi Lutke, Jim Keller, Sequoia Capital, and Capital Factory. In December 2022, Carmack departed as consulting CTO at Meta to focus his efforts on AGI.\n Sutton is the principal founder of the field of reinforcement learning. His work with Keen Technologies advances previously announced research priorities to understand basic computational intelligence. Through this work, documented in part in The Alberta Plan, Sutton seeks to understand and create long-lived computation agents that interact with a vastly more complex world and come to predict and control their sensory input signals.\n https://www.amii.ca/latest-from-amii/john-carmack-and-rich-sutton-agi/\n    submitted by    /u/blabboy  \n [link]   [comments]",

I understand that modern ML is going in the opposite low-precision direction, but I still think that it may be useful to have this functionality at least for some prototyping and development of concepts.\n The double-double approach to the evaluation of quads represents an FP128 number as an unevaluated sum of two double numbers (like 1 and 1e-17 - the second one is smaller than 1 ULP of the first one).

          "description": "TYPO IN THE TITLE: I wanted the title to be \"why should neural networks be end-to-end?\" My lazy ass was swipe texting on my phone and this typo happened. FML\n Especially in robotics, there's been a lot of research for end-to-end neutral networks where an image is the input and the control action is the output, for say, tasks like pick an object and place it somewhere. I feel this is very restrictive while developing such a solution because it tightly couples the \"control\" network to the \"estimation\" network. This reduces modularity in building the solution, i.e., if I find a better controller architecture (machine learning based or rule based) I'm unable to use that for the task I'm solving. Moreover it seems like the generalizability of this task suffers because training this network to do this task may make it very good at only doing that specific task and the explainability of the decision making goes out of the window because it is black box. Additionally doesn't more parameters mean requiring more data to train the model? I don't see much use from such network architectures. However, I do see the applications in machine translation where you simply train the encoder and decoder to the target language at the same time with a single loss function. It seems useful there, but maybe not so much in robotics.\n Can someone tell me their thoughts on end-to-end architectures? Let's have a healthy discussion\n Edit: typo\n    submitted by    /u/piccadilly_nickadeli  \n [link]   [comments]",

You can checkout a gallery of the examples, supported models include:\n  \nLarge language models: LLaMA, LLaMA v2, Falcon, Phi-v1.5, StarCoder.\n Quantized models with the llama.cpp approach: LLaMA, T5, Phi-v1.5.\n Image generation: Stable Diffusion, Wuerstchen.\n Computer Vision: DINOv2, yolo-v3, yolo-v8, Segment-Anything Model.\n Text-to-speech: Whisper.\n  \nOne of the big upside of the pure Rust approach is that models can run directly in the browser using WASM, these can be accessed through this collection, you can try out Yolo, Whisper, Segment-Anything, T5, Llama2-c from your web browser.\n Finally, in order to present a use case where Candle has unique capabilities, we've built a quantized version of the recently released Phi-v1.5 LLM. You can try it out with the following command, this uses a q4k quantized model resulting in very fast inference on CPU while still producing pretty nice texts.\n $ cargo run --example phi --release -- \\ --prompt \"Explain how to find the median of an array and write the corresponding python function.\\nAnswer:\" \\ --quantized --sample-len 200 Explain how to find the median of an array and write the corresponding python function.

          "description": "First of all anyone offended by that question - heartiest apology. I am using it myself profusely at the moment. The reason for me asking this question, over last few weeks / months, I have been gradually educating myself in machine learning using Tensorflow and have been able to train multiple models using only one of the model zoo candidates. All the other pre trained models have failed me so far.\n I went onto Tensorflow official forum / Stackoverflow / Tensorflow github with specific error messages that I am getting on Ubuntu with Nvidia card / Mac M2 and there has been absolute radio silence in response to multiple posts over last month. Found many open issues listed since 2020 on the same line as mine i.e. identical error messages that people have come across.\n Finally after about a month of being on TF forum, I direct messaged an official TF2 dev who kindly responded with answers. I haven't succeeded yet with any of the pre trained model from the official section. Only one model from research section is working so far for me i.e. Faster_rcnn_resnet_50_640x640 ..\n Thus the question. Kindly help me enlighten myself with where is this thing headed. Should I consider switching to Pytorch or some alternative ? If yes what alternatives do you recommend ? TIA\n    submitted by    /u/dpadhy  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "As software projects grow, changing code across entire repositories becomes tedious & error-prone. Tasks like migrating APIs or updating dependencies require complex edits across files. I explored a new approach from Microsoft Research to automate these \"repository-level\" coding challenges with AI.\n Their new paper proposes CodePlan - an AI system that breaks repository tasks into incremental steps guided by planning & analysis.\n Key points:\n  \nUses LLMs like GPT-3 for localized code edits\n Maintains validity across repository via incremental analysis\n Adaptively plans multi-step changes based on code dependencies\n Significantly outperformed baselines on API migration & temporal edits\n Automated tasks across 168 file C# codebase\n 2-3x more accurate edit locations than baselines\n Produced final valid codebases, unlike reactive approaches\n  \nThe core insight is combining LLM strengths with rigorous planning based on dependency analysis. This automates interdependent code changes that naive LLM use struggles with (I personally have these kinds of issues all the time with GPT4 - lack of context about the entirety of the repo/how files fit together).\n I think CodePlan demonstrates AI can expand beyond small coding assists into large-scale engineering tasks. Planning + LLMs > LLMs alone. This could really improve productivity and code quality... at least for me :)\n Full summary.

          "description": "I made a FOSS baby sleep tracking system. The system tracks wake/sleep status, and informs the user when their baby is likely to need a nap next. But it stopped working as soon as my baby started sleeping on his stomach, and started using blankets. The original version relied on anatomical features being visible.\n This version delivers the ability to train a blank slate SVM binary classifier on pictures of a user's baby, making it extremely biased (and resilient) to the custom behaviors the user's baby exhibits (blanket covering baby, teddy bear/other objects in crib, etc.). All generated data stays on your machine, nothing leaves the LAN.\n Video: https://youtu.be/8i0wHA_knKc?si=uhA4PpOYP0jMKLz1\n For obvious reasons I didn't have a dataset of babies sleeping.. so I wrapped a python/flask service with a React app which lets a user press a button to train the model w/ a new image from the camera's live stream. Then this model is invoked over time (+ other heuristics) to determine whether your baby is present and sleeping.\n I believe it works better than $300+ systems sold on the market, open sourced it: https://github.com/calebolson123/BabySleepCoach\n ​\n I'm thinking a fun next step for this project could be to apply privateGPT on the feature-engineered sleep records for a true \"Sleep Coach\"\n    submitted by    /u/GoochCommander  \n [link]   [comments]",

It strikes me odd that such a hot topic has such atrociously bad Wikipedia. I feel duty-bound to educate the near-future AI, since they'll be reading Wikipedia for the next few years at least.\n Currently I think it's mostly complete, but I still don't understand the mathematical details of DDIM (I tried reading the paper and could not understand it), or generally how it is possible to sample without noise. This is a serious problem since as far as I see most of practical diffusion models use deterministic sampling, and they are all based on the same principle as DDIM.\n If anyone could explain simply what DDIM is really doing that would be great. I understand part of the paper: that they constructed an entire family of distributions over trajectories that has the same two-point marginals.\n I also haven't got much in the section on Examples.

They'll develop interfaces to make it easier for others to fine-tune on top of their models. So that there will be less and less of a need for ML engineers that know how to create a deep learning model in Pytorch, and more and more of a need for data engineers that simply plug into pre-trained models. An AI assistant will also be quicker at coding up a more bespoke AI model for a companies needs, guided by data engineers.\n What do people think? Is this a scenario that they think will play out?

Teaching them to use visual tools could make them much more capable.\n A new paper introduces GPT4Tools - a method to efficiently teach existing LLMs to invoke tools for visual tasks without proprietary data.\n My highlights from the paper:\n  \nUses ChatGPT as a \"teacher\" to generate instructional data for other LLMs\n Fine-tunes LLMs like Vicuna on this data using selective weight tuning (keeps base model frozen)\n Allows smaller 13B LLM to match 175B GPT-3.5 on seen tools after tuning\n Data augmentation with negative/context samples was found to be the secret sauce to get this to work\n Can generalize to brand new visual tools in a zero-shot way\n  \nThis is big because it shows we may not need hyper-expensive training of massive models to impart visual capabilities to LLMs. They seems to be generalizable enough that they can be taught to work with images. Some examples shown include counting objects or segmenting items in pictures using other tools.\n With this approach, existing models can be made multi-modal! Pretty cool.\n Full summary.

Previous research gathered human preference data and then aligned the pre-trained models using reinforcement learning or instruction tuning, the so-called finetuning step. In contrast, aligning frozen LLMs without any extra data is more appealing. This work explores the potential of the latter setting. We discover that by integrating self-evaluation and rewind mechanisms, unaligned LLMs can directly produce responses consistent with human preferences via self-boosting.

          "description": "(I'm a Software Engineer who knows almost nothing about ML / NLP, so, apologies in advance if this doesn't make any sense.)\n I had a shower thought around if tokenization could incorporate meaning, so the models could be trained on \"thoughts\" instead of subword tokens (which is probably closer to how we humans think). To expand a little bit, we could first cluster all the words (maybe using the current day LLMs), then each token (or \"thought\") in the new scheme could represent a group of related words, followed by refinements that would be less and less important.\n For example, (cop_thought, cop_refinement) -> cop, but (cop_thought, police_refinement) -> police etc.\n So the encoding step would involve an LLM (which could possibly be relatively smaller), whose output would go to the actual model but the decoding would still be fairly straightforward. This could possibly free up some additional capacity in the actual model, assuming this heavy lifting tokenization makes its job easier, but as I'm typing it, I guess I'm simply moving some of the semantic understand happening in the hidden layers of the current day LLMs explicitly to the tokenization (encoding) step, which may not really change anything (if not make it worse).\n I'm still curious what folks think, if there's any related efforts (and all the ways I'm wrong -- https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Cunningham%27s_Law).

I know almost nothing about this kind of stuff, like what models I should use, how to annotate it best (should I use relational labels?), whether to use a transformer or something else, stuff like that.

If there are two matrices, A & B, of size n,r and r,m, and r = 1, and you multiply them, then it implies that n + m = 386k, which seems to be a bit much for a number of parameters in a single layer.\n Then we have two matrices of size a,r and r,b, where a = 100, b = 50 and there are 28k variables, according to the figure - in 4.1 they say 30k. If there's 30k, that would imply r = 200, for matrices of shape 100,200 and 200,50.\n I guess 386k and 28k are for the whole models, n and m differ from layer to layer, and r stays at one.

          "description": "Hello Reddit!\n I'm Daria from the Cerebras ML team, and I've got some thrilling updates to share with you! 🚀 We've recently published our BTLM-3B-8K paper on arXiv, and I’m excited to share that I am one of the authors! Check it out here: https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.11568\n It distills our recipe for training SOTA LLMs:\n  \nAn extensively deduplicated dataset: SlimPajama \n Hyperparameter search using muP \n Variable sequence length training + ALiBi \n Aggressive LR decay \n  \nOur BTLM-3B-8K not only sets a new standard for 3B parameter models but also frequently surpasses the performance of 7B models! In the paper, we meticulously outline how we developed the BTLM model and conducted a comprehensive analysis of its performance on 22 validation benchmarks. These benchmarks span a range of capabilities including common sense reasoning, world knowledge, reading comprehension, code generation, long sequence interpolation/extrapolation, bias, toxicity, and misinformation.\n For those eager to dive in, we've made our SlimPajama dataset and the BTLM-3B-8K model available on Hugging Face: https://huggingface.co/cerebras 🎉\n Feel free to delve into the details, explore the dataset and model, and let us know your thoughts, insights, or questions! We're here to discuss and excited to hear your feedback. Happy exploring! 🚀\n    submitted by    /u/daria-sobol  \n [link]   [comments]",

Researchers are looking for ways to train these large AI models without needing Google-scale resources.\n A new paper proposes LongLoRA, a fine-tuning approach that can extend LLaMA2 7B to 100k context length and 70B model to 32k context length on a single 8× A100 machine.\n Here are my highlights from the paper:\n Big one of course: LongLoRA efficiently fine-tunes large AI models on longer texts\n Key points:\n  \nApproximates standard attention via \"shift short attention\" during training\n Tuning only a subset of weights (LoRA) plus some embeddings & norms\n Fine-tuned 7B parameter model on 100k tokens with 1 machine\n Way lower training cost than full fine-tuning for large contexts\n Close to full fine-tuning performance\n  \nThe core insight is that an approximation of full attention enables efficient training while retaining standard attention for final inference. Combined with selective weight tuning, this really reduces compute needs.\n I think this demonstrates the potential to train more capable AI without unreasonable resources. Efficient training techniques = more powerful LLMs for the same resources.\n Full summary here.\n Arxiv paper: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.12307.pdf\n    submitted by    /u/Successful-Western27  \n [link]   [comments]",

Because all the logic is offloaded to users’ devices, data never leaves and there is no risk of it being used for finetuning by third parties.\n For now, we only support inference with LaMini-Flan-T5, so you might see modest performance. We plan to integrate Microsoft phi-1.5 for better performance once the 370M is out.\n We are also working on LlamaIndex-TS integration on the client side to have in-browser RAG for local querying of private documents.\n As our roadmap is quite dense, with RAG, internet search, improved inference, we welcome warmly contributors!

Here are the key highlights:\n  \nDespite training on text, langauge models compressed images 43% better than PNG, and audio nearly 2x better than flac.\n Confirmation of scaling laws - bigger models compressed better. But model size must match dataset size.\n There are tradeoffs between model scale, data size, and compression performance. More data enables bigger models.\n Tokenization (like BPE) generally hurts compression slightly by making prediction harder.\n Longer contexts let models exploit more sequential dependencies.\n  \nImplications:\n  \nModels have learned very general capabilities beyond just text. Their strong compression reflects deep understanding of images, audio etc statistically.\n I got some new perspective on model scaling laws and links between prediction and generalization.\n There's potential for practical applications compressing images, video etc. But large model size an issue.\n Overall it shows these models are very capable general purpose learners, not just for language.\n  \nFull summary here if you want more details.

Thought I should write a Tree-of-Thoughts model as my next project which will be somewhat similar, given what we're doing is learning the meaning behind words and phrases and then using that knowledge to generate a sequence based on a seed token or sequence of tokens.\n Here's how I was thinking it should go: I write a next token in sequence prediction model and write a generate function that generates a sequence of tokens on top of a seed token. Then I write a tree model that takes in whatever this bigram has learned and adds onto it some kind of knowledge about where one thought about the seed has been generated and stop there. Then iteratively generate a few more such thoughts based on the same seed.\n This is how I initially thought it would go but now when I'm writing, I've already written the bigram(next token prediction and generation), I don't know what to do next. I am kind of stuck.\n It will be interesting to see how you, if you've ever written a similar model or are good at NLP, would attempt this. Looking at a variety of different approaches to the same problem I am trying to solve would be great.\n So I decided to post here.

Looking at the TimeGAN paper (code) and other implementations such as the one by YData, considering that the training dataset is divided into slices (like a rolling window) of N length and that the generated sequence will follow the same format, that is [batch size, N, n_features], what we are effectively generating are slices and not a fully synthetic time-series.\n ​\n To clarify my question, the output of a TimeGAN is only a set of slices, although there is no guarantee that generated slice(N-1) is the one before slice(N), and so the true use of a TimeGAN is generating slices that can be used to train a predictive TS model but not reconstructing a complete time series like the one used for training.\n ​\n I suspect that's the case (useful only to generate good slices for training predictive models) as there is no fully generated time series in the paper or any of the codes, while the quality of the generated data is partially measured by training a model on original data and generated data and comparing their predictive performance. If anyone can confirm/develop upon these thoughts I would be extremely grateful.\n    submitted by    /u/iReallyReadiT  \n [link]   [comments]",

Becuase the model is small and training is not complicated. If I were to deploy to Kubernetes pods, it seems wasteful that many pods are doing the same thing( prediction for the same model, maybe just as high availability guarantee?) .\n Does the training phrase or data cleansing phase need to be containerized and deployed? Because this seems like a one-off process.\n How to deploy a scalable service? I am new to this. Each container may have a HTTP service. How to load balance them on Kubernetes from outside?\n What kind of CI/CD do you recommend for this task?

          "description": "Project Page\n Paper\n Code \n Abstract:\n  \nEvent cameras offer many advantages over standard cameras due to their distinctive principle of operation: low power, low latency, high temporal resolution and high dynamic range. Nonetheless, the success of many downstream visual applications also hinges on an efficient and effective scene representation, where Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) is seen as the leading candidate. Such promise and potential of event cameras and NeRF inspired recent works to investigate on the reconstruction of NeRF from moving event cameras. However, these works are mainly limited in terms of the dependence on dense and low-noise event streams, as well as generalization to arbitrary contrast threshold values and camera speed profiles. In this work, we propose Robust e-NeRF, a novel method to directly and robustly reconstruct NeRFs from moving event cameras under various real-world conditions, especially from sparse and noisy events generated under non-uniform motion. It consists of two key components: a realistic event generation model that accounts for various intrinsic parameters (e.g. time-independent, asymmetric threshold and refractory period) and non-idealities (e.g. pixel-to-pixel threshold variation), as well as a complementary pair of normalized reconstruction losses that can effectively generalize to arbitrary speed profiles and intrinsic parameter values without such prior knowledge. Experiments on real and novel realistically simulated sequences verify our effectiveness. Our code, synthetic dataset and improved event simulator are public.\n  \n   submitted by    /u/Sirisian  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hi all.\n I have been tinkering with a project to get quicker learning for CNNs. \n The idea came after reading the SDProp paper. Algorithms using adaptive learning rate can be interpeted as muliplying the gradient(with or without momentum) with the inverse square-root of the covariance matrix. Using a diagonal estimate of the covariance matrix.\n Which begs the question: what happens if we use a fuller estimate? I chose to include covariances between the elements of convolutional filters. I.e. a conv.weight of size [n_out,n_in,5,5] needs a tensor of size [n_out,n_int,25,25] to store its contribution to the covariance matrix.\n for 3x3 filters and 5x5 filters, torch.linalg.eigh could be used to calculate the square root of the covariance matrices. For 7x7, I used newtons method to approximate the square root.\n In the figure below are some results for a 6 layer CNN on CIFAR 100. Huge gains iteration for iteration. But is it quicker? Not a lot. A bit for the smaller 3x3 filter. More optimizations could still be made. And it will obviously depend on network architecture and computer hardware. \n I'm sure there could be some use-cases. The computation of the square-root calculations is invariant to batch_size and image_size (unless number of filters also is increased).\n If anyone is interested I can also link to my torch implementation of the optimizer, once I get it up on github.\n Not sure if this, or something like it, has been done before? Would love to have some papers linked if so...\n https://preview.redd.it/kyy0ogr0qapb1.jpg?width=714&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=96ac499fb8ab35ce13e7c59bbe3dbc94ba275b9c\n https://preview.redd.it/p52zllr0qapb1.jpg?width=342&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=8663a9c3c782d192b16289a735b53da6a8d29c47\n    submitted by    /u/maka89  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hello all,\n I am currently working on a project where my team and I have collected a rich dataset of biomedical sensor data from clinical trials earlier this year. Our aim is to use this sensor data to predict changes in specific biomarkers over time. The data's tensor shape is B,T,F,C, where:\n  \nB = batch size\n T = sequence length\n F = sampled frequencies\n C = features at each frequency\n  \nCurrently, my approach involves flattening this tensor to B,T,−1 and then feeding it to a transformer model. While this has yielded reasonable results, I'm contemplating whether there are more effective ways to prepare the data for the transformer model.\n Here are my specific concerns:\n  \nFlattening the tensor might dilute the information specific to each frequency across various features.\n I could potentially miss the chance to capture frequency-related variations within the features.\n  \nTo address these, I've considered a few options:\n  \nSelf-attention over individual features or frequencies: Although this could be effective, it might make the model too large given my medium-sized dataset.\n Using convolutional layers: Preliminary experiments with this approach have not led to any significant improvements.\n  \nI'm particularly interested in any thoughts on how to make my transformer more receptive to the multi-dimensional nature of my dataset. Increasing the number of attention heads to better accommodate all features is also on the table.\n Does anyone have any insights or can point me to relevant papers or codebases for handling such multi-dimensional data with transformers?\n Thank you for your help!\n    submitted by    /u/BiomedEngineer_  \n [link]   [comments]",

We demonstrate that FFFs are up to 220x faster than feedforward networks, up to 6x faster than mixture-of-experts networks, and exhibit better training properties than mixtures of experts thanks to noiseless conditional execution. Pushing FFFs to the limit, we show that they can use as little as 1% of layer neurons for inference in vision transformers while preserving 94.2% of predictive performance.\n  \nFast feedforward networks can be used anywhere where feedforward and mixture-of-experts networks are used, delivering a significant speedup.\n ​\n    submitted by    /u/lexected  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Paper: https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.09400\n Hugging Face datasets: https://huggingface.co/datasets/uonlp/CulturaX\n Abstract:\n  \nThe driving factors behind the development of large language models (LLMs) with impressive learning capabilities are their colossal model sizes and extensive training datasets. Along with the progress in natural language processing, LLMs have been frequently made accessible to the public to foster deeper investigation and applications. However, when it comes to training datasets for these LLMs, especially the recent state-of-the-art models, they are often not fully disclosed. Creating training data for high-performing LLMs involves extensive cleaning and deduplication to ensure the necessary level of quality. The lack of transparency for training data has thus hampered research on attributing and addressing hallucination and bias issues in LLMs, hindering replication efforts and further advancements in the community. These challenges become even more pronounced in multilingual learning scenarios, where the available multilingual text datasets are often inadequately collected and cleaned. Consequently, there is a lack of open-source and readily usable dataset to effectively train LLMs in multiple languages. To overcome this issue, we present CulturaX, a substantial multilingual dataset with 6.3 trillion tokens in 167 languages, tailored for LLM development. Our dataset undergoes meticulous cleaning and deduplication through a rigorous pipeline of multiple stages to accomplish the best quality for model training, including language identification, URL-based filtering, metric-based cleaning, document refinement, and data deduplication. CulturaX is fully released to the public in HuggingFace to facilitate research and advancements in multilingual LLMs: this https URL. \n  \n​\n https://preview.redd.it/3u5dddpv66pb1.png?width=834&format=png&auto=webp&s=780b590cf621b548c525ed15305b091246c5414c\n    submitted by    /u/InterviewIntrepid889  \n [link]   [comments]",

Despite advancements in motion quality and physical plausibility, two pivotal factors, versatile interaction control and the development of a user-friendly interface, require further exploration before the practical application of HSI. This paper presents a unified HSI framework, UniHSI, which supports unified control of diverse interactions through language commands. This framework is built upon the definition of interaction as Chain of Contacts (CoC): steps of human joint-object part pairs, which is inspired by the strong correlation between interaction types and human-object contact regions. Based on the definition, UniHSI constitutes a Large Language Model (LLM) Planner to translate language prompts into task plans in the form of CoC, and a Unified Controller that turns CoC into uniform task execution. To facilitate training and evaluation, we collect a new dataset named ScenePlan that encompasses thousands of task plans generated by LLMs based on diverse scenarios. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework in versatile task execution and generalizability to real scanned scenes. \n  \nhttps://preview.redd.it/0twcwloc82pb1.jpg?width=1078&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=71bca59aae81ec114f49a742cc42f78cabc9e4c0\n https://preview.redd.it/439nzmoc82pb1.jpg?width=1637&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f33059c78a9d845437d551886c5f3a657ddd91fb\n https://preview.redd.it/df6i4ooc82pb1.jpg?width=758&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=eeb33395d9de1196b4d00531c9e063c8c8fb22cd\n ​\n    submitted by    /u/Singularian2501  \n [link]   [comments]",

Since that moment, folks have asked whether the same is possible for regression datasets?\n Figuring out this question required extensive research since properly accounting for uncertainty (critical to decide when to trust machine learning predictions over the data itself) poses unique challenges in the regression setting.\n Today I have published a new paper introducing an effective method for “Detecting Errors in Numerical Data via any Regression Model”. Our method can find likely incorrect values in any numerical column of a dataset by utilizing a regression model trained to predict this column based on the other data features.\n We’ve added our new algorithm to our open-source cleanlab library for you to algorithmically audit your own datasets for errors. Use this code for applications like detecting: data entry errors, sensor noise, incorrect invoices/prices in your company’s / client’s records, mis-estimated counts (eg. of cells in biological experiments).\n Find errors in regression data in just a few lines of code.\n Extensive benchmarks reveal cleanlab’s algorithm detects erroneous values in real numeric datasets better than alternative methods like RANSAC and conformal inference.\n If you'd like to learn more, you can check out the blogpost, research paper, code, and tutorial to run this on your data.\n    submitted by    /u/jonas__m  \n [link]   [comments]",

This is even possible for linear transformers, which effectively perform linear optimization on deep representations of features calculated by earlier layers.\n https://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.05858.pdf\n For those unfamiliar, instrumental convergence is the idea that entities with different goals will tend towards different subgoals. Examples could include gathering power, not dying, acquiring resources, etc. A famous thought experiment, known as the paperclip maximizer, is the idea of an AI that is optimized for paperclip production taking over the world so it can build as many paperclips as possible.\n However, if models are dynamically pursuing different objectives at runtime via generated mesa-optimizers, even if instrumental convergence is real, would we still expect it to happen? Without a constant objective given subgoals might start to conflict with each other. On the other hand, since instrumental convergence implies that different goals benefit from similar sub-objectives, perhaps the varying mesa objective doesn't really matter.\n ​\n    submitted by    /u/30299578815310  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hi,\n I'am trying to get the 3D keypoints coordinates from an image or video and then map it to SMPL model. It's pretty easy to get the keypoints from an image or video using the mediapipe library. But the mapping of it with the SMPL model is something that I can't figure out. mainly because the skeleton structure is different. Some already had a similar issue but the answers were not clear and he didn't even ask futher. Is it possible to do this?? if it's not possible with mediapipe is there some other library that I could use?? I heard about openPose too but when I tried it didn't work someone was saying it works only on windows 11. There are some other parts also to this project which will mostly be dealt with Pytorch. There are some pose estimators in TensorFlow but I want to stick to pytorch hence would like some pose estimators in that framwork, or a library or somehing inside opencv\n https://preview.redd.it/w9mioiyxhvob1.png?width=951&format=png&auto=webp&s=3886c356513b62efbcaddaa76841457cf3eb22e5\n https://preview.redd.it/xjal9kyxhvob1.png?width=506&format=png&auto=webp&s=7f544a3050fbd744d300d2bf6e1a286a4014ece5\n    submitted by    /u/rakk109  \n [link]   [comments]",

GNN training frameworks PyG and DGL that most people use seem to default to using Neighbor Sampling for minibatch training. I am hoping that with my new paper Layer-Neighbor Sampling -- Defusing Neighborhood Explosion in GNNs, this default might be due to change.\n My new approach combines the layer sampling approach with the neighbor sampling approach. The result is that there is more overlap in the sampled neighborhoods and one still gets a fixed number of neighbors per seed vertex. It is even possible to turn it into a subgraph sampling approach by fixing the random seed used for sampling across all layers of the GNN m…",

          "description": "Today we live in a world of multi-model LLMs. How will the following technologies fare against these LLM-based models? \n  \nNeural VQA\n \nSemantic Scene Segmentation\n \n Multi-model LLM are emerging quickly now, (such as NExT-GPT https://next-gpt.github.io/ ) . When you consider the kind of \"understanding\" of a visual scene these models are capable of, what will happen to prior approaches like Neural VQA? The nagging feeling that Neural VQA is going to be completely superseded by LLMs is palpable. The only vestige left for the older technology may have something to do with reasoning about the objects , such as properly counting the number of objects of a category that are present. But even that is getting sketchy. \n On the topic of scene understanding, we can turn to semantic scene segmentation. SSS is a more complicated topic than Neural VQA. SOTA SSS algorithms are still largely employing DeConv Nets, and still require fully labelled datasets. With multi-model LLMs, there is a nagging question : Why go through the complexity/mess of first segmenting a scene very accurately, when an LLM can do better at identifying the entire scene's category in one fail swoop? \n One might suggest that SSS still has a use in regards to interacting with the segmented objects of an environment, where one such \"interaction\" would be avoiding collisions with pedestrians, trees, or other cars. But honestly, SSS does not really make this connection with planning and action, it really only gives you the categories of the segments. THe autonomous vehicle's next moves are still an open problem. \n What technologies do you expect that multi-model LLMs will supersede, if any?\n    submitted by    /u/moschles  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hey. First of all I'm not a researcher on this area, so pardon my ignorance.\n I'm looking to employ a GAN on a dataset. The goals are still a bit unclear, but it's mainly to improve classification by either data augmentation and class balancing, or understanding the data through the latent representations.\n I'm really keen on InfoGAN at the moment. I trained one on the MNIST and the continuous variables learned the rotation and width, as in the paper and other peoples code.\n But at this point I think I need some help. I have labels, which means that maybe I should use a conditional GAN. But how will I learn similar representations as those in InfoGAN? I know StyleGAN is the current big thing in this area, but my images are limited to similar pixel-range as MNIST, and StyleGAN seems dependant on the ProGAN idea of increasing resolution for training.\n I'm a bit confused on the whole topic and would love a pointer to any discussion etc., as I can't seem to find anything but papers and they seem to be only focused on human faces, my data is unnatural not unsimilar again to MNIST. I don't have semantical information either as I see many papers employing that.\n I see many papers employing semi-supervision in this area, but honestly I'm just a bit lost and overwhelmed as this is not my area and GAN papers are still not stopping (I read a post here from 2017 about a GAN making GANs...).\n If you read this far: thank you and any pointers and discussion are very welcome. I would post on /r/learnmachinelearning but I feel the discussion in there is very different from this. My main goal is data exploration, but also to prove effectiveness some classification will be necessary and here the generative approach may help to augment data efficiently.\n    submitted by    /u/Infamous-Bank-7739  \n [link]   [comments]",

We consider language agents as a promising direction towards artificial general intelligence and release Agents, an open-source library with the goal of opening up these advances to a wider non-specialist audience. Agents is carefully engineered to support important features including planning, memory, tool usage, multi-agent communication, and fine-grained symbolic control. Agents is user-friendly as it enables non-specialists to build, customize, test, tune, and deploy state-of-the-art autonomous language agents without much coding. The library is also research-friendly as its modularized design makes it easily extensible for researchers. \n  \nhttps://preview.redd.it/3bdi71r5rgob1.jpg?width=1131&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=760942c19be6ecda791414c812a77e72751c526d\n https://preview.redd.it/howf64r5rgob1.jpg?width=1656&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=636744fccab7a1c2bafb902bad5dbb647440fff5\n ​\n    submitted by    /u/Singularian2501  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Paper: https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.07315\n Abstract:\n  \nTransformers have significantly advanced the field of natural language processing, but comprehending their internal mechanisms remains a challenge. In this paper, we introduce a novel geometric perspective that elucidates the inner mechanisms of transformer operations. Our primary contribution is illustrating how layer normalization confines the latent features to a hyper-sphere, subsequently enabling attention to mold the semantic representation of words on this surface. This geometric viewpoint seamlessly connects established properties such as iterative refinement and contextual embeddings. We validate our insights by probing a pre-trained 124M parameter GPT-2 model. Our findings reveal clear query-key attention patterns in early layers and build upon prior observations regarding the subject-specific nature of attention heads at deeper layers. Harnessing these geometric insights, we present an intuitive understanding of transformers, depicting them as processes that model the trajectory of word particles along the hyper-sphere.\n  \n​\n https://preview.redd.it/0i302t857gob1.png?width=1864&format=png&auto=webp&s=1da999c014979bdb6c99809d5b38eb5ccfd717d0\n    submitted by    /u/CoolThingsOnTop  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Paper. I am not affiliated with this work or its authors.\n Abstract:\n  \nTransformers have become the dominant model in deep learning, but the reason for their superior performance is poorly understood. Here, we hypothesize that the strong performance of Transformers stems from an architectural bias towards mesa-optimization, a learned process running within the forward pass of a model consisting of the following two steps: (i) the construction of an internal learning objective, and (ii) its corresponding solution found through optimization. To test this hypothesis, we reverse-engineer a series of autoregressive Transformers trained on simple sequence modeling tasks, uncovering underlying gradient-based mesa-optimization algorithms driving the generation of predictions. Moreover, we show that the learned forward-pass optimization algorithm can be immediately repurposed to solve supervised few-shot tasks, suggesting that mesa-optimization might underlie the in-context learning capabilities of large language models. Finally, we propose a novel self-attention layer, the mesa-layer, that explicitly and efficiently solves optimization problems specified in context. We find that this layer can lead to improved performance in synthetic and preliminary language modeling experiments, adding weight to our hypothesis that mesa-optimization is an important operation hidden within the weights of trained Transformers.\n  \nTwitter thread about the paper from one of the paper's authors.

          "description": "Paper: https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.07062 \n Abstract:\n  \nWe explore the novel application of Large Language Models to code optimization. We present a 7B-parameter transformer model trained from scratch to optimize LLVM assembly for code size. The model takes as input unoptimized assembly and outputs a list of compiler options to best optimize the program. Crucially, during training, we ask the model to predict the instruction counts before and after optimization, and the optimized code itself. These auxiliary learning tasks significantly improve the optimization performance of the model and improve the model's depth of understanding.\n We evaluate on a large suite of test programs. Our approach achieves a 3.0% improvement in reducing instruction counts over the compiler, outperforming two state-of-the-art baselines that require thousands of compilations. Furthermore, the model shows surprisingly strong code reasoning abilities, generating compilable code 91% of the time and perfectly emulating the output of the compiler 70% of the time. \n  \nhttps://preview.redd.it/f9c7kh7bd9ob1.jpg?width=1530&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=287fffa714936da9b9a5141b7e01609942416156\n https://preview.redd.it/z4a0ce7bd9ob1.jpg?width=1537&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e6275b2b53fa6f431b87940784629b3270c656f9\n https://preview.redd.it/89toie7bd9ob1.jpg?width=750&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9a71bdb2eeeff52b2f8bbb3cf2b678debcd4a060\n https://preview.redd.it/0krmqd7bd9ob1.jpg?width=1536&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ba3fade0883ee621b185fabc67839db42ea74a53\n https://preview.redd.it/8nz00i7bd9ob1.jpg?width=1198&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=6ddbddf68311f576fbf3c52a47381316feace8c9\n ​\n ​\n    submitted by    /u/Singularian2501  \n [link]   [comments]",

Filtered datasets are released with the same license as the datasets they stem from.\n  \nAbstract:\n  \nThe current trend of scaling language models involves increasing both parameter count and training dataset size. Extrapolating this trend suggests that training dataset size may soon be limited by the amount of text data available on the internet. Motivated by this limit, we investigate scaling language models in data-constrained regimes. Specifically, we run a large set of experiments varying the extent of data repetition and compute budget, ranging up to 900 billion training tokens and 9 billion parameter models. We find that with constrained data for a fixed compute budget, training with up to 4 epochs of repeated data yields negligible changes to loss compared to having unique data. However, with more repetition, the value of adding compute eventually decays to zero. We propose and empirically validate a scaling law for compute optimality that accounts for the decreasing value of repeated tokens and excess parameters. Finally, we experiment with approaches mitigating data scarcity, including augmenting the training dataset with code data or removing commonly used filters.

When I take the average of all iterations I get poor results (F1 score= 0.5), but if I pool all the predictions and compute the F1 score at the end, I achieve decent performance (F1 score =0.7). So, in my project, it is in my best interest to use the second approach, and somebody that I trust tells me that it is okay to do this approach.

          "description": "I'm working on a project that involves analyzing large samples of Java codes. My end goal is to perform classification based on these codes. For this, I've been trying to efficiently encode the full names of the methods (in the package.class.methodname format) in the Java code.\n Currently, I am experimenting with doc2vec. I'm treating the components of each method's full name (separated by dots) as individual documents. This allows me to produce vectors for each method name, and I evaluate the results by computing the cosine similarity between pairs of similar method names. The results were not good so far.\n Before moving to doc2vec, I tried using an LLM which gave me good results. However, the inference time was far too long, especially given the scale at which I'm working. I also considered using a Bag of Words model, but quickly realized it wouldn't be effective. Many of the method names in my samples are obfuscated, making this approach unsuitable.\n The issue I'm facing is that using the direct method names as features is not generalizing well for classification. A slight change in a method's name results in losing that particular feature, making my model fragile.\n What are some optimal encoding methods for small sentences (around 5-6 words) like these method names, that can scale well? \n Also, Are there any specialized encoding techniques tailored for software code that I could use for this task?\n Any suggestions or insights would be really helpful.

However, existing systems struggle because the key-value cache (KV cache) memory for each request is huge and grows and shrinks dynamically. When managed inefficiently, this memory can be significantly wasted by fragmentation and redundant duplication, limiting the batch size. To address this problem, we propose PagedAttention, an attention algorithm inspired by the classical virtual memory and paging techniques in operating systems. On top of it, we build vLLM, an LLM serving system that achieves (1) near-zero waste in KV cache memory and (2) flexible sharing of KV cache within and across requests to further reduce memory usage. Our evaluations show that vLLM improves the throughput of popular LLMs by 2-4× with the same level of latency compared to the state-of-the-art systems, such as FasterTransformer and Orca. The improvement is more pronounced with longer sequences, larger models, and more complex decoding algorithms. \n  \nhttps://preview.redd.it/x8w8ckejv2ob1.jpg?width=667&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=28fae778b67ac28fc72d084f071b12c92cb5ea07\n https://preview.redd.it/ctlrqpejv2ob1.jpg?width=1468&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=31755d169673ee5d30efa3f05bd6cb10813b328d\n https://preview.redd.it/z5r7knejv2ob1.jpg?width=1504&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9ceb5370aa5a7cc0688fe9a3771a0328262c3a01\n ​\n ​\n    submitted by    /u/Singularian2501  \n [link]   [comments]",

What I know is that in a standard transformers architecture, temperature is the only parameter that can enduce non deterministic behaviour at inference time. \n He was convinced that there was more to it \"i spoke about this to other LLM experts and they also are not sure\" \n I'm like wtf - I start looking up online and do find some people who claim that temperature is not the only thing that influences stochasticity during inference, but I can't find an answer as to what it is exactly. \n Anyone has a clue of what I am missing here? \n Thanks!\n    submitted by    /u/WagnerianJLC  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "So i have been doing some research to get into the LLM quantization field but have some questions. To better organize my ideas i have developed the image below. Does it make sense / is true?\n The way i understand it there are 3 main methods which are compatible with different backends (the backend part is still quite confusing to me). What is the core diference between what the methods do and the backends? What are some core diferences between the backends? What is the main distinction between GPTQ and NF4? How does NF4 relate to QLoRa, is it the same or is it just a small part of QLoRa?\n Thanks in advance and i apologize for any ignorance.\n ​\n https://preview.redd.it/gxpo0ir0yunb1.png?width=1041&format=png&auto=webp&s=872424a58a9d4393c025b8d2cec0160979b035f4\n    submitted by    /u/MiNeves  \n [link]   [comments]",

I initially used a pre-trained ViT model with ImageNet weights model=vit_b_32(ViT_B_32_Weights.IMAGENET1K_V1), and it gave me an impressive accuracy of 88%. However, I want to modify the architecture of the ViT model and train it from scratch without relying on ImageNet weights.\n I'm aware that ViT models are data-hungry and that training from scratch (model=vit_b_32( )) can be challenging, especially with limited data. I've already applied data augmentation techniques to enhance my dataset, but I'm still struggling to achieve satisfactory results. My accuracy is currently only 7%.\n I'd appreciate any advice or tips from the community on how I can improve the performance of my scratch-trained ViT model. Are there any specific training strategies, hyperparameters, or architectural modifications that I should consider? How can I make the most out of my limited dataset to boost accuracy?\n Thank you in advance for your help!\n    submitted by    /u/NoEntertainment6225  \n [link]   [comments]",

As we want to move the model to production, I’m keen on understanding the best strategies to evaluate its performance in a real-world setting.\n This is a small example of how we would “tag” our recommendations:\n  \nIf the model predicts a size M, and the user buys and keeps it, it’s a correct prediction\n If the user buys and M and returns it due to size issues, it’s incorrect\n If the user buys a different size, returns it, and then buys the size initially recommended, it’s counted as correct.\n  \nAdditionally since we cache user input data, when they visit the same product after a while, or if they visit different product pages, they don’t need to re-input. We need to determine if they looked at this recommendation or if they even took it into account, especially if some time has passed since the original recommendation was made.\n Main questions I have: 1. What scenarios might I be missing when tagging incorrect/correct predictions 2. How would you approach the data tagging issue in this context? 3. What would be the best strategy to determine if a recommendation was considered by the user or if it’s too old to be reliable?\n I’ve gotten some insights already but would love to hear more perspectives.

He was a musician, and I found a handful of songs he had recorded in the 80's. Unfortunately but I only have a copy coming from an audio cassette, which I've digitized. There may be a copy on open reel somewhere in our basement but I haven't found it so far.\n Any, because dad was always writing and recording new songs, my training dataset consists of all original, high quality vocal stems at 96khz/24bit, spanning at least 20 years and consisting of about 30 ish minutes of audio. I also tried starting over but with a speech he gave as additional training, coming out to around 55 minutes of audio.\n I wanted to use his voice model to essentially remaster his original vocals from the cassette audio, and rerecord the rest of the instruments myself. I isolated the vocals using UVR (also tried mdx23), and tried to clean it up further as much as possible.\n The RVC vocals comes out alright, but due to the low quality of the audio, it seems to mess up certain words, for example \"free\" comes out as \"fee\". The SVC vocals came out with a closer tonality, but had many more artifacts, and pitch had a tendency to go up/down 2 octaves at the end of certain phrases.\n When using a higher quality sample (like one of my own vocal tracks), these issues aren't so prevalent, although rvc seems to create more of a hybrid sounding timbre than svc, blending the original voice + model rather than just the sound of the model.\n Happy to post samples of input/output audio, let me know!\n tl;dr\n high quality training data, low quality inference audio.

          "description": "Paper: https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.02427 \n Github: https://github.com/ysymyth/awesome-language-agents \n Twitter: https://twitter.com/ShunyuYao12/status/1699396834983362690 \n Abstract: \n  \nRecent efforts have incorporated large language models (LLMs) with external resources (e.g., the Internet) or internal control flows (e.g., prompt chaining) for tasks requiring grounding or reasoning. However, these efforts have largely been piecemeal, lacking a systematic framework for constructing a fully-fledged language agent. To address this challenge, we draw on the rich history of agent design in symbolic artificial intelligence to develop a blueprint for a new wave of cognitive language agents. We first show that LLMs have many of the same properties as production systems, and recent efforts to improve their grounding or reasoning mirror the development of cognitive architectures built around production systems. We then propose Cognitive Architectures for Language Agents (CoALA), a conceptual framework to systematize diverse methods for LLM-based reasoning, grounding, learning, and decision making as instantiations of language agents in the framework. Finally, we use the CoALA framework to highlight gaps and propose actionable directions toward more capable language agents in the future. \n  \nhttps://preview.redd.it/09kdff4sdonb1.jpg?width=1276&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=7aaa6d59d602f7e9ab124c812bbfa6bba5b7373b\n https://preview.redd.it/6cly0e4sdonb1.jpg?width=1277&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5a5164b84af5f828a668560acb64e5c579693d1f\n https://preview.redd.it/mvatjf4sdonb1.jpg?width=1277&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=7c3a039db3a7e0f3de38f761f8aefa1c8d331ae5\n https://preview.redd.it/bj5wdj4sdonb1.jpg?width=1270&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=473b273ae0097aaa51d6578e9c5e3b9c953cc421\n https://preview.redd.it/501cnf4sdonb1.jpg?width=1578&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c8b1762ac28c89f8ac2f8d4fb6d9ecae06491c3e\n ​\n ​\n    submitted by    /u/Singularian2501  \n [link]   [comments]",

I need to segment some short strings, they are about 100 tokens in length (BERT tokens), or 20-40 words. 1 segment per text.\n I'm currently using Spacy first, and if it fails, then use BERT.

So binary token classification, then smooth out outliers and pick the longest segment of each text. Each string has only 1 segment.\n I've trained the BERT with 500 examples.

The datasets cover topics about income, employment, health, transportation, and housing. They are quite useful for studying the effects of distribution shifts on ML models.\n For example, one could design experiments to:\n 1. Study the model's performance under geographic distribution shifts:\n Each prediction problem in Folktables can be instantiated with data from every US state. So one could use Folktables to study questions around geographic distribution shifts. For example, we can train a classifier using data from California and then evaluate it on data from Michigan.\n 2. Study the model's performance under temporal distribution shifts.\n Folktables contains data for several years, which in itself constitutes a form of temporal distribution shift. So, we can train a classifier using employment data from California in 2014 and evaluate how its equality of opportunity violation or accuracy varies over time.\n Finding non-synthetic (and open-access) datasets that exhibit these behaviors is so hard! Yet, it's quite easy to encounter them in production environments. 🫠\n So, big kudos to the UC Berkeley and Toyota Research Institute research teams for crafting these datasets.\n Folktables Python package: https://github.com/socialfoundations/folktables\n Link to paper where Folktables was introduced: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2108.04884.pdf\n    submitted by    /u/santiviquez  \n [link]   [comments]",

I'm primarily interested in extracting specific events or insights, such as security incidents or device malfunctions. The conventional method would be to use regular expressions to filter out relevant information since the logs are structured, but I'm curious about leveraging Large Language Models for this task.\n I've experimented a bit with zero-shot learning for text summarization but didn't get satisfactory results. Before I invest more time into fine-tuning an LLM, I'd love to hear from anyone who has experience or advice on how to approach this problem.\n Could LLMs potentially make the process more efficient and effective?

I've gotten reasonable results which is extremely fast with standard Python coding, but it's far from perfect due to the lack of standardized templates. \n Interestingly, when I tested ChatGPT-4 on a sample table, it did a decent job at data extraction. However, relying solely on GPT-4 has its downsides like token limits and slow processing speed (and data privacy issues). Plus, splitting the Excel sheet to fit within these limits results in loss of context and data.\n I'm considering fine-tuning a language model to post-process data that was in a Pandas DataFrame (perhaps converted to JSON). Has anyone had success with this approach or have alternative recommendations? I've tried Langchain, but it wasn't helpful.\n I have figured out to extract the relevant columns, but the post-processing part is where I am considering using an LLM which understands the domain and what needs to be extracted based on the examples I feed it.\n Looking forward to your thoughts!

          "description": "I've been using Tensorflow since 2017. I know it wasn't ideal or easy back then, but as an early adopter, I became very proficient with it and it has improved a lot since then. I have developed and deployed many custom models in low-level TF, both with and without utilizing the Keras abstractions. I am very comfortable with it in general.\n But I'm noticing now that Pytorch is gaining more popularity, all the younger practitioners, who got into deep learning within the last 3-5 years, are Pytorch adopters. I've also heard rumors that even googlers are also abandoning TF.\n I started playing around with Pytorch and as a TF expert, I couldn't help but getting annoyed at how far it is lagging behind in many abstractions and optimizations. I know things are getting better now with the Pytorch 2.0 and introducing some optimization such as the \"compile\" functionality, but still many of the pytorch project tools remain in beta such as Torchtext and I find many things very annoying, such as having to set the device and pass it on to layers if you want GPU acceleration, having to install Torchtext and other processing libraries separately, or having to use a Dataloader and the limited data type supports for torchdataset.\n Most people who have not mastered Tensorflow would not relate to my annoyance. Anyhow I'd really prefer to stay within my comfort zone and continue to develop and improve in TF, but if TF is dying, then I better not to, right? So should I convert?

The dataset provides these articles in GitHub-flavored Markdown format, preserving layout features like lists, code blocks, math, and block quotes, unlike many other public Wikipedia datasets. Articles are accompanied by a short description of the page as well as any associated categories.\n Thanks to a careful conversion process from wikicode, the markup language used by Wikipedia, articles in GoodWiki are generally faithful reproductions of the corresponding original Wikipedia pages, minus references, files, infoboxes, and tables. Curated template transclusion and HTML tag handling have minimized instances where entire words and phrases are missing mid-sentence like in other public Wikipedia datasets.\n GoodWiki is more than 1.5 times larger (when compared using the same tokenizer) than the widely used WikiText-103 dataset by Merity et al., even after excluding article descriptions.

For lack of a better term, I'm referring to this as Unified Retrieval Augmented Generation (URAG).\n The closest I can find to this in the literature is TABR which utilizes recall to improve the performance of LLMs relative to tree based models, although this particular application of Retrieval is extremely computationally expensive for a slight performance improvement, unlike RAG for LLMs that seems to provide significant new capabilities to the model.\n Is there more research going on for what I'd refer to as URAG systems?

          "description": "Article | Notebook | GitHub\n There are a rapidly growing number of options in the vector database space. One of the more recent developments is the creation of new vector index plugins for traditional database systems such as pgvector. This is reminiscent of the discussion back in the mid 2010s on whether one should use full text search in the database or sync with an external system such as Elasticsearch.\n Just as with full text search, it will be tough for vector indexing in the database to compete with the more dedicated solutions past the simple use cases. For example, according the ANN-Benchmarks, the dedicated vector solutions score much higher.\n The desire to reduce stack complexity and the maturity of systems like Postgres make strong arguments to try to find a way to do it all in the database.\n The referenced article above proposes a way to integrate existing databases like PostgreSQL with vector indexes such as Faiss, Hnswlib, external vector databases and even keyword indexes like Elasticsearch. This opens up the possibility of combining Postgres features such as fine-grained access control with the performance of a dedicated vector index.\n ​\n    submitted by    /u/davidmezzetti  \n [link]   [comments]",

These clusters will have varying sizes, and I don´t know what the final number of clusters will be. The database consists of up to 100 thousand signals (represented by 4000 long vectors as read from individual text files) which are already quite similar to each other. \n Ideally I would just make a huge cross-correlation matrix but that is too computationally expensive. So is DTW. What I have done is to apply the fast fourier transform to get it into the frequency domain and therefore get rid of that time shift. Then I would apply a clustering algorithm. I have tried DBSCAN and hierarchical agglomerative clustering which work relatively well but don’t scale well to datasets of this size. Affinity propagation is quick and works okish but I don’t know how to optimise it. \n Does anyone have any recommendation on which algorithm to use and how to optimise it?

This firm would advocate for the career interests of the most passionate ML engineers. \n Our representation would encompass: \n - Strategic Career Development: Crafting a strategic approach to help engineers secure opportunities aligned with their desired projects and professional development. \n - Impact Matching: Identifying and connecting engineers with projects and teams where their technical skills, career goals, and personal interests can have the greatest positive impact, ensuring that your work aligns with your values and aspirations. \n - Industry Leadership: Positioning you as an industry leader by marketing your expertise and securing speaking engagements at conferences and other events, enhancing your professional visibility and reputation. \n In return for this representation, engineers would commit to a 3% fee deducted from their salary, which would support the services provided by the firm. \n Would you be interested in participating in such a service? If not, would you consider recommending it to someone you know? If you are in favor of this idea, what makes you believe it would be advantageous for others even if it might not be your preference?

So I already have the voice I want to use (edited with uvr5 and it sounds really great, without any echo or noise on the background), I trained it on aivc so that I can generate this voice verbalizing the text content I need. I used high quality - it took like 40min to generate each phrase - and it is ok, but still a little robotic. So I installed RVC and trained a model with the original voice (edited with the uvr5) just like I did the training on aivc. So I loaded the trained model on the inference tab and I selected the audio to be processed - the generated audio files from aivc. Even selecting the harvest mode, the output was worse than the generated files from aivc. I even tried to record my own voice speaking the text but it does not sound good. My trained model on rvc has 500 epochs, and it may be a very good model to use, yet idk what I’m doing wrong. Maybe I’m misusing rvc, so what I need is to improve the realism of my aivc(or tortoise) generated voices, simple as that, is rvc the best option to do this? If yes, how?

More precisely, I am interested on the finetuning piece since a lot of businesses are starting to entertain the idea of self-hosting LLMs trained on their proprietary data rather than relying on third party APIs. To this point, I am tracking the following 4 pillars of evaluation that businesses are typically look into: - Performance - Time to train an LLM - Cost to train an LLM - Inference (throughput / latency / cost per token)\n For each LLM, my aim is to benchmark them for popular tasks, i.e., classification and summarization. Moreover, I would like to compare them against each other.\n So far, I have benchmarked Flan-T5-Large, Falcon-7B and RedPajama and have found them to be very efficient in low-data situations, i.e., when there are very few annotated samples. Llama2-7B/13B and Writer’s Palmyra are in the pipeline.\n But there’s so many LLMs out there! In case this work interests you, would be great to join forces.\n GitHub repo attached — feedback is always welcome :)\n https://github.com/georgian-io/LLM-Finetuning-Hub\n Happy hacking!\n    submitted by    /u/l-llm  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Let me give you a quick intro. My engineering experience primarily revolved around data processing, analytics, and distributed systems. Nonetheless, I had a desire to learn about ML, and imho the best way to learn is to work on a practical project. So, that's precisely what I did. A few months ago, I embarked on an exciting journey with a friend, and together, we've created http://github.com/huggingbench/huggingbench.\n Now, after three months, I find myself seeking validation for some of my assumptions from the broader community. If you'd like to learn more about our motivations and the path we've taken check out the blog post https://medium.com/@niksa.jakovljevic/introducing-huggingbench-a-path-to-optimized-model-serving-a17cecc8d3ec.\n What I'd like to gather from individuals with machine learning models in production is their level of investment in optimizing inference. Is this a commonplace practice? I acknowledge that it can vary on a case-by-case basis, but I'm still hopeful of identifying prevailing trends. After conversing with a few companies, I've come to the impression that only the truly large players (those spending six figures or more on inference per month) place significant emphasis on inference optimization, which is entirely understandable. Nevertheless, I sense that there are numerous low hanging fruits that could result in substantial cost savings, even for typical startups.\n Could it be that the entire machine learning field is still in its infancy, and many engineers may not be fully considering or prioritizing such optimizations? Perhaps businesses are not giving as much attention to cost considerations? Alternatively, there might be technical challenges I'm not yet aware of. In any case, I would greatly appreciate hearing your insights on the subject of inference optimization.\n    submitted by    /u/unsigned_mind  \n [link]   [comments]",

Bugs in AI algorithms might cause incorrect diagnoses and treatment prescriptions, leaving them cautious. Individual differences, the doubt is whether AI can truly empathize with patients.\n By contrast, advocates of AI in medicine contend that the technology can considerably improve diagnosis and treatment accuracy. Faster and more accurate than humans, machines can analyze large amounts of data. Not only does it identify rare and complex diseases, but it also saves time and resources.

To further unleash the power of LLMs to accomplish complex tasks, there is a growing trend to build agent framework that equips LLMs, such as ChatGPT, with tool-use abilities to connect with massive external APIs. In this work, we introduce ModelScope-Agent, a general and customizable agent framework for real-world applications, based on open-source LLMs as controllers. It provides a user-friendly system library, with customizable engine design to support model training on multiple open-source LLMs, while also enabling seamless integration with both model APIs and common APIs in a unified way. To equip the LLMs with tool-use abilities, a comprehensive framework has been proposed spanning over tool-use data collection, tool retrieval, tool registration, memory control, customized model training, and evaluation for practical real-world applications. Finally, we showcase ModelScopeGPT, a real-world intelligent assistant of ModelScope Community based on the ModelScope-Agent framework, which is able to connect open-source LLMs with more than 1000 public AI models and localized community knowledge in ModelScope. \n  \nhttps://preview.redd.it/9f77992ynpmb1.jpg?width=1245&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=4e17e3d46c7f262bfec76b88e086164530739255\n https://preview.redd.it/etelh03ynpmb1.jpg?width=1219&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=517a52a1e2bbf488b647c4e1b9b496657003c1d2\n https://preview.redd.it/b0tkra2ynpmb1.jpg?width=850&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=397c910b2d90dd212a31ec118d1c4e78532bf5f4\n ​\n ​\n    submitted by    /u/Singularian2501  \n [link]   [comments]",

We train the Llama 2 models on three real-world use cases and demonstrate that using LoRA involves a trade-off between serving efficiency and model quality, which varies according to the specific task at hand. Additionally, we offer insights into how to stabilize training with LoRA through intelligent prompting techniques. We further show that adopting a lower learning rate can enhance the reliability of the resulting model checkpoints. \n Link to the blog post \n If you have questions, I'd be happy to answer them here!\n    submitted by    /u/atta_snack  \n [link]   [comments]",

I know very little on the subject (I am a game engineer with a reasonable experience of cloud / AWS stuff), but it seems to me that it might be a good fit: features would be the state of the board (i.e. all the cards in play or in hand or in deck), the turn, and whether the current player has won that game or not (eventually), and label would be the action taken (that turn).\n I was looking at SageMaker, hoping that it would streamline and allow me to try something relatively easily, but I immediately found it complicated and quite unclear.\n I would be very grateful if anyone could point me at resources describing at a high level what a full ML pipeline could look like (i.e. what software can injest this kind of data, what software can provide inference, etc.).

I was a bit surprised as smaller (~100 million) size models already like RoBERTa exist for such cases.\n Not much content online about this beside this recent paper : https://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.10092.pdf\n Highly recommend reading it, here are a few take aways:\n  \nMost LLM benchmarks today focus on capabilities like understanding, reasoning and Q&A. They often overlook performance on specific nlp tasks like text classification, NER, etc.\n Llama 2 (70b) required fine-tuning to beat GPT 3.5 in some tasks. Both were still overall outperformed by RoBERTa.\n In certain cases GPT4 did better. However smaller open models provide more advantages in terms of speed, cost and transparency.\n The difference of speed/latency (often more important than accuracy in production) and the cost differences between LLMs and \"Smaller\" models is mind blowing in my view (see screenshots)\n  \n​\n Cost, speed and throughput comparaison\n How good the models do on various tasks/datasets\n Note: Not saying benchmarks are a source of truth, just found the analysis interesting, always take benchmarks with a grain of salt. \n If you're using LLMs for anything else beside text generation, I'm curious to know more about your experience so far :) cheers!\n    submitted by    /u/EnthusiasmNew7222  \n [link]   [comments]",

My curiosity centers around how these models manage to perform translation tasks as an emergent property of next token prediction.\n So, here's my question: Does the training data for models like GPT-3.5 contain text explicitly linking between languages, such as a dictionary, or do they learn translation by assigning similarity between words in different languages based on mathematical metrics like cosine distance?So in that sense, being indepedently trained on several textbooks of different languages (not on the same topic), they would be able to link languages simply by their arithmetic properties? I hope that's making sense.\n For instance, if you look at words like \"queen\" in English and \"rainha\" in Portuguese, they share a certain similarity that could be quantified using mathematical similarity metrics. I'm wondering if through this similar vector assignment, the models learn what means what.\n I'm more leaning towards the latter, but I'm too lazy to pursue this empirically.As a follow up question, does this mean that if we are able to predict whale conversation, we would be able to translate it to English as well?\n Thanks in advance for any input you can provide! 🤓\n    submitted by    /u/AlexandreFSR  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "So I know that embeddings work by finding words that are used in similar contexts or found around some input word. This allows us to find similar words based on proximity to other words and in a way, map a relationship between an input word and other words.\n But I assume children learn what words mean and the intuition behind them, by hearing the word and associating it with visuals or a specific scenario in front of them which helps them to add context to that word and how it is used.\n If we were to emulate how children learn words, could we or is there an architecture that allows us to take an input word, find images with the input word in there (Object detection) and then extract the context from the images (other objects and their position and relation to the input word) then convert that context to phrases and query those phrases the next time that a word is inputted to see other phrases or words that are similar to the input word based on whether or not they appear in the images of the input word.\n Not sure if it makes sense or if it is even useful compared to embeddings but I was thinking about how we could emulate how children learn words to see if we could draw influence from that. Just wondering if there’s a similar approach to this where we use context from images to find similar words and phrases to some input.\n    submitted by    /u/4K-AMER  \n [link]   [comments]",

Furthermore (c) Equinox offers advanced tools like true runtime errors, out-of-place pytree surgery, and checkpointed while loops, and AFAIK in the JAX ecosystem these are unique to Equinox.\n For those most familiar with PyTorch: for many use cases (sciML in particular), JAX has a much stronger compiler, more advanced autodiff, etc. And whilst JAX itself is akin to the torch.* namespace, libraries like Equinox are then akin to the torch.nn.* namespace.\n Because of its speed and features, right now JAX+Equinox is my favourite approach to numerical computing.

Here, we report an efficient brain-inspired computing algorithm for SNNs and ANNs, referred to here as neuromodulation-assisted credit assignment (NACA), which uses expectation signals to induce defined levels of neuromodulators to selective synapses, whereby the long-term synaptic potentiation and depression are modified in a nonlinear manner depending on the neuromodulator level. The NACA algorithm achieved high recognition accuracy with substantially reduced computational cost in learning spatial and temporal classification tasks. Notably, NACA was also verified as efficient for learning five different class continuous learning tasks with varying degrees of complexity, exhibiting a markedly mitigated catastrophic forgetting at low computational cost. Mapping synaptic weight changes showed that these benefits could be explained by the sparse and targeted synaptic modifications attributed to expectation-based global neuromodulation. \n  \nhttps://preview.redd.it/5lcx3sn8ramb1.jpg?width=711&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=4431b81708bb9ab98e6351f4b979897ad8244ed9\n https://preview.redd.it/vgsuqsn8ramb1.jpg?width=718&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f0602185fcb0dc6ec29308f77f1db77a4f4a562d\n https://preview.redd.it/hpfuftn8ramb1.jpg?width=709&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=545f4fab3033cb68637052e7ff2c4775a12a7b99\n https://preview.redd.it/7plm0tn8ramb1.jpg?width=714&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b138b1c43a2078297b69c09d26de013865629e77\n https://preview.redd.it/uc6tnrn8ramb1.jpg?width=703&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=fcf747b2515fbf6e78b1ef7aa66ce9ca4d223cd3\n    submitted by    /u/Singularian2501  \n [link]   [comments]",

Are there any products like that? Forgive me if this is too basic; I've only dabbled in ChatGPT and MidJourney to see what the fuss is about.

So far I've been manually writing/tweaking a python script I wrote to recursively extract the nested bullets and duplicate their hierarchy parents' content for each of the inner-most bullets, that way each bullet has all the contextual content it needs to be valuable in a vacuum. \n So something like: (a) 1.

More specifically, we present Logic Competence Measurement Benchmark (LOGICOM), a diagnostic benchmark to assess the robustness of LLMs against logical fallacies. LOGICOM involves two agents: a persuader and a debater engaging in a multi-round debate on a controversial topic, where the persuader tries to convince the debater of the correctness of its claim. First, LOGICOM assesses the potential of LLMs to change their opinions through reasoning. Then, it evaluates the debater’s performance in logical reasoning by contrasting the scenario where the persuader employs logical fallacies against one where logical reasoning is used. We use this benchmark to evaluate the performance of GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 using a dataset containing controversial topics, claims, and reasons supporting them. Our findings indicate that both GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 can adjust their opinion through reasoning. However, when presented with logical fallacies, GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 are erroneously convinced 41% and 69% more often, respectively, compared to when logical reasoning is used. Finally, we introduce a new dataset containing over 5k pairs of logical vs. fallacious arguments.

The method allows for re-using the same generated data multiple times and thus has an efficiency advantage with respect to Online RL techniques like PPO.\n ​\n Paper: https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.08998\n ​\n Abstract:\n Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) can improve the quality of large language model's (LLM) outputs by aligning them with human preferences. We propose a simple algorithm for aligning LLMs with human preferences inspired by growing batch reinforcement learning (RL), which we call Reinforced Self-Training (ReST). Given an initial LLM policy, ReST produces a dataset by generating samples from the policy, which are then used to improve the LLM policy using offline RL algorithms. ReST is more efficient than typical online RLHF methods because the training dataset is produced offline, which allows data reuse. While ReST is a general approach applicable to all generative learning settings, we focus on its application to machine translation. Our results show that ReST can substantially improve translation quality, as measured by automated metrics and human evaluation on machine translation benchmarks in a compute and sample-efficient manner.\n ​\n Authors: Caglar Gulcehre, Tom Le Paine, Srivatsan Srinivasan, Ksenia Konyushkova, Lotte Weerts, Abhishek Sharma, Aditya Siddhant, Alex Ahern, Miaosen Wang, Chenjie Gu, Wolfgang Macherey, Arnaud Doucet, Orhan Firat, Nando de Freitas\n    submitted by    /u/ykilcher  \n [link]   [comments]",

The proof for MAML convergence is fairly complicated and I expect that a proof that has additional second order gradient terms and feedback loops will probably involve a lot of work and I am wondering if anyone could provide some sort of insight or intuition as to what such a result would look like?

          "description": "Problem: Given time series data of the last few years, one data point per day (eg price of a product or sales made this day). My job is to predict the next 7 days, ie. 7 scalars. \n Approach: Train one model for each time lag. The first model predicts tomorrow, the second model the day after tomorrow and so on (7 models in total). The features are the last prices of the last 7 days and some saisonal features (calendar week, price on this day last year and so on). \n Question: is there anything wrong with this approach? It doesn’t feel like the most elegant method to train 7 separate models. The problem with using a single model is, that this model must be able to predict 7 values of different points in time (and i don’t want to give the model input data of 7 days and let it predict all 7 scalars at once. The model should only use the features of a single day to predict this day). The 2 other to options I have considered are to train an autoregressive model (model just learns to predict the next day. To predict the day after tomorrow you give it its own prediction as input). Or to build a „time-lag“ feature, which tells the model how far in the future this datapoint lies. But this doesn’t make sense, because there is nothing like a weekly trend or so. \n What do you think?

          "description": "Hello everyone! I've noticed that most beginner-level tutorials on recommender systems primarily focus on model training, with limited information about deploying them in a production environment. Additionally, the different usage of models in the recall (retrieval) and ranking modules can indeed be confusing for beginners.\n Recently, I've been working on a recommender system project that encompasses both offline development and online deployment, covering both recall and ranking modules. The entire project is developed using Python and executed on a single laptop. All components are contained within Docker, ensuring no impact on the local environment. \n The GitHub repo: https://github.com/akiragy/recsys_pipeline\n You can follow the commands provided in the README to run it. \n This project primarily utilizes PyTorch, Redis, Elasticsearch, Feast Feature Store, Triton Inference Server, and Flask. \n PyTorch is used for training the FM model for recall and the DeepFM model for ranking. \n Redis serves as the store for user terms and vectors, while Elasticsearch is used to create an item term index and a vector index. Redis and Elasticsearch form the recall module. \n Feast is utilized to store user and item features, while Triton serves as a real-time prediction engine. Feast and Triton form the ranking module. \n Flask is deployed as the web server, receiving recommendation requests and returning responses. \n Thanks for checking it out!\n    submitted by    /u/Johann_SebastianBach  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "We released another preprint on a neuro-symbolic approach called \"metacognitive error correction and detection rules\" (EDCR). The idea is that if you have a trained neural model, you can symbolically fine tune the results with rules. In this initial study, we apply it to the classification of GPS movement traces.\n Video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_OV4lap_rk\n Preprint: https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.14250\n Code: https://github.com/lab-v2/Error-Detection-and-Correction\n Further information: https://neurosymbolic.asu.edu/metacognition/ \n In the example below, we show the results for a single class. The rules detect errors by identifying classifications that may be incorrect and then re-assign to a new class. While recall can drop for a given class, we can bound the drop in recall with a hyperparameter - but this is guaranteed to improve precision. This is illustrated in the below figure. We show this approach leads to an overall improvement in accuracy over the base model, including the state-of-the-art. We also examine the effects when encountering classes not seen in the model's training data.\n We provide theoretical as well as empirical results and believe this approach can be used in other use-cases in the future.\n ​\n https://preview.redd.it/3z0cdp80dulb1.png?width=635&format=png&auto=webp&s=2eff6ce0f2c7b6983dbfbc030f0f7993010a30fb\n    submitted by    /u/Neurosymbolic  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "If an AI were to take on this task, it would primarily rely on data mining and natural language processing (NLP) techniques. First, the AI would scrape digital platforms to collect works authored by various people. Platforms could range from academic databases like PubMed or ArXiv to blogs, forums, and social media. The goal would be to capture a wide array of intellectual output, irrespective of the person's titles or accolades.\n Next, an NLP model would evaluate the collected content based on factors like originality, complexity, and coherence. Advanced sentiment analysis could be employed to gauge the depth of understanding and nuances in the arguments made. Specialized algorithms could also be developed to assess the impact of each piece of work, using metrics such as citations, social shares, or subsequent works that build upon it.\n The AI would then create a shortlist based on these evaluations. This stage might also involve unsupervised machine learning techniques like clustering to find patterns or commonalities among the top contenders.\n The final stage would be validation, possibly using reinforcement learning. The AI could simulate various scenarios or problems and predict how the content created by these individuals would contribute to solving them. It would then refine its list based on the simulated outcomes.\n This all-AI approach would drastically reduce human bias and could be executed relatively quickly. However, it's important to note that any such system would need to be designed carefully to avoid introducing biases present in the training data or algorithms.\n    submitted by    /u/Georgeo57  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "When visualizing the inner workings of vision transformers (ViTs), researchers noticed weird spikes of attention on random background patches. This didn't make sense since the models should focus on foreground objects.\n By analyzing the output embeddings, they found a small number of tokens (2%) had super high vector norms, causing the spikes.\n The high-norm \"outlier\" tokens occurred in redundant areas and held less local info but more global info about the image.\n Their hypothesis is that ViTs learn to identify unimportant patches and recycle them as temporary storage instead of discarding. This enables efficient processing but causes issues.\n Their fix is simple - just add dedicated \"register\" tokens that provide storage space, avoiding the recycling side effects.\n Models trained with registers have:\n  \nSmoother and more meaningful attention maps\n Small boosts in downstream performance\n Way better object discovery abilities\n  \nThe registers give ViTs a place to do their temporary computations without messing stuff up. Just a tiny architecture tweak improves interpretability and performance. Sweet!\n I think it's cool how they reverse-engineered this model artifact and fixed it with such a small change. More work like this will keep incrementally improving ViTs.\n TLDR: Vision transformers recycle useless patches to store data, causing problems. Adding dedicated register tokens for storage fixes it nicely.\n Full summary. Paper is here.\n    submitted by    /u/Successful-Western27  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I was cooking chicken wings one evening ago in the not too distant past and this idea popped into my head. Before the night was over I went online and bought the domain name of GoGoAIGo . com and then the .ai version also. I put the dot com version up on Sedo (sedo.com/search/details/?domain=GoGoAIGo.com) for sale and I actually now own the .com .ai .org and .net versions of that phrase. Not only my decade but the two generational decades in front of me and the one generational decade behind me can remember our ole Inspector Gadget friend whom had a similar phrase, but not exact, that he would say.\n I'm an individual whom may hold onto something if I feel it has intrinsic value for a future development, which I think this can if laid out in an appropriate fashion. I'm working on another business project right now and I own some trademarks for my other business project so I'm not exactly a newbie in ways here I'm just kind of fresh to the AI realm studies. I think it's overblown right now but will be fine tuned over the next 5-7 years better and society will find a better seat for it.\n I could see this domain being like a search engine or something, maybe even something to do with robots. I expect AI robots moving forward will be regulated and have various classes that they are placed into as we integrate certain ones in our society. Let's be honest, the light-switch isn't flipping overnight or even in one quick year over this AI stuff. I'm in no rush to have a piece of AI wash my dishes for me to be honest. The last robotic thing I was thinking about getting was a robot mower to cut a field, I believe they are working on those now.\n Anybody have any unique ideas for me? I used to play with lego robots way back in high school in the early 2000's.... Seems like this website would make a great search engine but honestly there are other phrases that can be put into play with society also.\n Thanks for any mental stimulation you can toss in my direction.\n    submitted by    /u/Wise_Cut_2543  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Imagine an app that's like a helpful buddy in your pocket, always looking out for the best moments to nudge you into some real-world socializing. For example, say you're a fan of watching sports. The app notices you frequently check scores or read articles on sports sites during weekends. Right before a big game, it pops up and says, \"How about inviting some friends over to watch the game?\"\n Now let's talk about making socializing a sort of game. Think of the way Fitbit rewards you for walking 10,000 steps. Similarly, this app could reward you with \"social points\" for various activities. Invite a friend for coffee? 10 points. Call your mom? 15 points. Organize a barbecue? 50 points. And so on. These points could unlock virtual badges or even real-world rewards like discounts at local restaurants to encourage you to keep going.\n When it comes to setting personal goals, let's say you've been wanting to improve your relationship with a sibling. You set a goal in the app to have at least one meaningful conversation with them each week. The app then reminds you on a lazy Sunday afternoon, suggesting, \"Why not call your sister now? It’s a good time to catch up.\"\n And for reflection, after you've hung out with your friends to watch the game or had that talk with your sister, the app asks you to rate how good you felt on a scale of 1-10. Over time, you'll see a graph of your happiness levels correlated with your social activities, making it super clear that quality time with people is a mood booster.\n The whole idea is to keep it simple but effective, helping you to naturally weave more social interactions into your life without making you feel overwhelmed or stressed.\n    submitted by    /u/Georgeo57  \n [link]   [comments]",

This retains alignment with text descriptions.\n Latent diffusion then serves as a super-resolution expert, upsampling efficiently while preserving fidelity.\n  \nBy blending complementary techniques, Show-1 moves past tradeoffs limiting the individual models.\n More details here.

          "description": "Automatic code generation has always been an integral part of programming: compilers, synthesis tools, convertors, etc. are examples of classic code generators. Now, with such powerful LLMs at hand, it is only natural to try to find new ways to generate codes. The question is: are LLMs the right tool for code generation?\n There are two sides to code generation: (1) understanding the intent (a.k.a. capturing the spec) (2) writing the code. LLMs are great for (1), but not so good for (2).\n This is an example of using LLM for general-domain code generation:\n https://github.com/RoboCoachTechnologies/GPT-Synthesizer \n You can see that the main focus here is to properly capture the spec, and that's where LLMs shine.\n LLMs solution for a general-domain code generation may not be complete or optimized. It is always easier to break the problem and solve code generation in a specific domain. Here you can see how much better and cleaner the output of code generation can be when it is limited to a specific domain (robotics domain, ROS in particular, in this case):\n https://github.com/RoboCoachTechnologies/ROScribe\n What are your thoughts on using LLMs for code generation?\n    submitted by    /u/RoboCoachTech  \n [link]   [comments]",

Most of the software I found either specifically designed to change users voice on the spot and is aimed at gamers changing your voice for live streams or in-game chats. I’m also on a Mac, which I know will be limiting.\n I’m having a hard time finding something I can use. Any suggestions will be helpful. \n Thank you!\n EDIT: To clarify, I don’t want to just change my voice to sound different in general. I want to specifically sound like a woman, an elder man, or someone of a different ethnic background. Those are just a few examples.\n    submitted by    /u/nopetoocreepy  \n [link]   [comments]",

It allows quantifying the sophistication of moral thinking through a P-score.\n In this new paper, the researchers tested prominent LLMs with adapted DIT prompts containing AI-relevant moral scenarios.\n Key findings:\n  \nLarge models like GPT-3 failed to comprehend prompts and scored near random baseline in moral reasoning.\n ChatGPT, Text-davinci-003 and GPT-4 showed coherent moral reasoning with above-random P-scores.\n Surprisingly, the smaller 70B LlamaChat model outscored larger models in its P-score, demonstrating advanced ethics understanding is possible without massive parameters.\n The models operated mostly at intermediate conventional levels as per Kohlberg's moral development theory. No model exhibited highly mature moral reasoning.\n  \nI think this is an interesting framework to evaluate and improve LLMs' moral intelligence before deploying them into sensitive real-world environments - to the extent that a model can be said to possess moral intelligence (or, seem to possess it?).\n Here's a link to my full summary with a lot more background on Kohlberg's model (had to read up on it since I didn't study psych).

          "description": "Training giant AI models like GPT-3 requires large resources - thousands of GPUs running for months. As a solo researcher without access to that kind of scale, I can't easily reproduce experiments and findings from papers on huge models.\n But a new paper from DeepMind shows you can recreate and study training instabilities seen in massive models by using small ones.\n The key is increasing the learning rate:\n  \nThis reproduces \"attention collapse\" where the model focuses on just a few tokens, like overfitting.\n Also can reproduce \"logit divergence\" where output values drift unstably.\n  \nThese issues have been reported when scaling up to billions of params. The cool part is techniques that fix them for giant models also work for small models:\n  \nqk-layernorm prevents attention collapse.\n Adding a \"z-loss\" term stops logit divergence.\n  \nSome other highlights from the paper include:\n  \nLonger warmup helps stability, especially for bigger models.\n Decoupling LR and weight decay improves stability.\n Depth increases sensitivity much faster than width.\n Can predict upcoming issues from scaling trends.\n Default epsilon hurts at large scale.\n  \nIf the authors are right, one more tool that lets researchers study and even help train giant models without Google-size resources. Small models can guide large model development, sort of like how you can build a scale train set to study and improve how a railroad system works... for a lot less money than starting your own railroad company, buying land, building real tracks, etc.\n Full summary.

I'm thinking of publishing a book, and I want to create clean reproductions of the stamp designs without the cancelation marks.\n If I train AI on high resolution scans of 10 to 40 identical stamps, is there a tool that can look for commonalities within the patterns and then remove conflicting artifacts (cancelation stamps, tears, and smudges)? I'm aiming for a 400% enlargement that shows off clean and accurate detail. \n What tools would I need? I’d prefer not to upload these scans to the web. Are there downloadable tools available? I’m technologically savvy and very experienced in graphic design software but have no experience in coding.\n All of this can be done manually in Photoshop, of course.

Most of the alignment focus out there is on superintelligence, little out there focuses on building modern day Ai that benefits humans. That’s been my focus for 17 years when I dreamed up what was possible and sent a proposal to executives at the mfaang corporation I was working at. I found out back then business doesn’t give a rats ass about Ai that actively makes its users life’s better. Well now I have proof that customers care. I’m hoping to find some resources on Ai alignment groups, conferences, more books etc. I’ll need to hire skilled ml engineers who do give a rats ass. Compassionate Ai isn’t just feel good tech. It would be good to do some networking. AI alignment doesn’t have to wait for AGI and super intelligence. It can and should be a focus today. My startup is proving it.

This is a wonderful sub, and it's hard to please everyone on SUCH a broad topic... but it's intriguing to think about, as a lifelong magazine fan (and websites of course) - about using AI to filter, craft and create an amazing website/magazine ABOUT AI - well-categorized, maybe also human/editor curated/tweaked, but as fresh as ... well, the artificial sub but out of the Reddit bold/design into something ... well, something I'd read, visit a lot and love to help make work as a writer/editor (on the side of my \"real\" all-consuming gig of course;-)\n After all, if AI can 'make great code'/create great websites, maybe some folks out there are already trying to make this happen, for ease of information availability and organization. I can picture the departments/sections/categories now - I bet you can too!\n Anyone gone very far down that road yet (maybe the folks already doing the PC Magazines of the world) of organizing the vast fast-moving info beyond the AI Brews, Ben Parr's AI Analyst, etc.?

Some examples shown include counting objects or segmenting items in pictures using other tools.\n With this approach, existing models can be made multi-modal! Pretty cool.\n Full summary.

Researchers are looking for ways to train these large AI models without needing Google-scale resources.\n A new paper proposes LongLoRA, a fine-tuning approach that can extend LLaMA2 7B to 100k context length and 70B model to 32k context length on a single 8× A100 machine.\n Here are my highlights from the paper:\n Big one of course: LongLoRA efficiently fine-tunes large AI models on longer texts\n Key points:\n  \nApproximates standard attention via \"shift short attention\" during training\n Tuning only a subset of weights (LoRA) plus some embeddings & norms\n Fine-tuned 7B parameter model on 100k tokens with 1 machine\n Way lower training cost than full fine-tuning for large contexts\n Close to full fine-tuning performance\n  \nThe core insight is that an approximation of full attention enables efficient training while retaining standard attention for final inference. Combined with selective weight tuning, this really reduces compute needs.\n I think this demonstrates the potential to train more capable AI without unreasonable resources. Efficient training techniques = more powerful LLMs for the same resources.\n Full summary here.\n    submitted by    /u/Successful-Western27  \n [link]   [comments]",

Here are the key highlights:\n  \nDespite training on text, langauge models compressed images 43% better than PNG, and audio nearly 2x better than flac.\n Confirmation of scaling laws - bigger models compressed better. But model size must match dataset size.\n There are tradeoffs between model scale, data size, and compression performance. More data enables bigger models.\n Tokenization (like BPE) generally hurts compression slightly by making prediction harder.\n Longer contexts let models exploit more sequential dependencies.\n  \nImplications:\n  \nModels have learned very general capabilities beyond just text. Their strong compression reflects deep understanding of images, audio etc statistically.\n I got some new perspective on model scaling laws and links between prediction and generalization.\n There's potential for practical applications compressing images, video etc. But large model size an issue.\n Overall it shows these models are very capable general purpose learners, not just for language.\n  \nFull summary here if you want more details.

Scientific discoveries, technological improvements, and medical advancements will be how much of this change will take place.\n Since health is so important to our well-being, AI finding cures for illnesses like obesity, cancer, diabetes and heart disease will be a godsend to all. But curing diseases is not how medical AIs can help us the most. \n It has been estimated that well over 50% of the illnesses we humans fall prey to result from our ethical choices. We eat too much, drink too much, eat too many animal foods, don't exercise enough and don't keep ourselves as emotionally healthy as we could.\n Wouldn't it be wonderful if we could respect our lives and our health enough to make the kinds of choices that keep us much healthier? That is how AI will probably be more helpful to us than in any other way. \n We humans have not been able to figure out how to become better, more ethical, people because we are simply not intelligent enough to make that all-important change. Now consider an AI that is two or three times more intelligent than the most intelligent person who has ever lived. This could easily happen before 2030. Imagine that intelligence dedicated to the task of helping us all become better people. \n These AIs would motivate us to make better health choices, have healthier relationships, and have healthier thoughts and feelings. Beyond the amazing technological changes that are just around the corner, that is probably how AIs will help us the most.\n This is why alignment is so important. It's not enough to align AIs to always be truthful and serve humanity's interests. We must train them to help us become better people. It wouldn't surprise me if by 2030 the whole of humanity experiences a profound ethical reformation that leads us all to enjoy much happier and healthier lives.\n    submitted by    /u/Georgeo57  \n [link]   [comments]",

His waiting three hours to stop the violence that followed suggests that he did.\n Bard:\n Trump's request to walk peacefully to the Capitol building gates would not have stopped the certification of the election results. The certification process is a joint session of Congress, and it would have required a majority vote in both the House and the Senate to overturn the results. Even if Trump's supporters had peacefully marched to the Capitol, they would not have been able to prevent Congress from certifying the results.\n It is possible that Trump did not fully understand the certification process, or that he was simply trying to appease his supporters. However, it is also possible that he expected his supporters to storm the Capitol and prevent Congress from certifying the results. This is supported by the fact that he waited over three hours to call off the violence. During that time, he continued to tweet messages of encouragement to his supporters, and he even praised them for their patriotism.\n It is also worth noting that Trump had been repeatedly warned by his advisors about the possibility of violence on January 6. However, he ignored these warnings and continued to urge his supporters to fight to overturn the election results.\n In conclusion, it is impossible to say for sure whether Trump expected his supporters to storm the Capitol on January 6. However, the evidence suggests that he was at least aware of the possibility of violence, and that he was willing to allow it to happen in order to overturn the results of the 2020 election.\n    submitted by    /u/Georgeo57  \n [link]   [comments]",

It provides up to 24 times more throughput than former systems.\n  \nThe Mechanics of PagedAttention\n  \nPagedAttention offers a novel approach to memory management by permitting continuous storage in non-contiguous memory spaces.\n It enhances memory efficiency resulting in better GPU utilization, with practically only 4% inefficiency.\n  \nImproved memory sharing and system performance\n  \nPagedAttention significantly improves memory sharing, resulting in a 2.2 times speed gain while lowering memory usage by 55%.\n With vLLM, the throughput of known LLMs can be increased by 2-4 times without impacting accuracy or causing delay.\n  \n(arXiv) (github) (reference article)\n P.S.

          "description": "There is no one definitive answer to this question, as the percentage of our thoughts that come to us on their own without our consciously choosing them can vary depending on the individual and the situation. However, some estimates suggest that up to 95% of our thoughts may be involuntary.\n This is because our thoughts are constantly being influenced by a variety of factors, both external and internal. For example, our environment, our emotions, and our physical state can all play a role in determining what thoughts pop into our heads.\n In addition, our brains are constantly processing information and making predictions, even when we are not actively thinking about anything. This process can sometimes lead to spontaneous thoughts, such as when we suddenly remember something that we had forgotten or when we come up with a new idea.\n While some of our spontaneous thoughts may be negative or intrusive, many of them can also be helpful or creative. For example, a spontaneous thought may help us to solve a problem, come up with a new solution, or simply make us smile.\n Overall, it is clear that a significant portion of our thoughts come to us without our consciously choosing them. This is a natural part of the human cognitive process and can be both beneficial and detrimental.\n    submitted by    /u/Georgeo57  \n [link]   [comments]",

Compare today with the WWII years, explaining how much we have to be grateful for.\n Bard said:\n I agree that these are difficult times. The world is facing many challenges, including the COVID-19 pandemic, climate change, and political instability. However, I believe that we have much to be grateful for today compared to the WWII years.\n Here are just a few things:\n We live in a time of peace. World War II was a global conflict that caused the deaths of millions of people. Today, there are no major wars raging on.\n We have access to advanced medical care. During WWII, many people died from diseases that are now easily treatable. Today, we have antibiotics, vaccines, and other medical advances that have saved countless lives.\n We have a higher standard of living. In the WWII years, many people lived in poverty. Today, most people in the developed world have access to clean water, food, and shelter.\n We have more opportunities for education and advancement. In the WWII years, many people were denied an education because of their race, gender, or social class. Today, education is more accessible than ever before, and people from all backgrounds have the opportunity to succeed.\n We have a better understanding of the world. During WWII, there was a lot of misinformation and propaganda. Today, we have access to more information than ever before, and we can make more informed decisions about our lives.\n Of course, there are still many challenges that we face today. But I believe that we have come a long way since the WWII years, and we have much to be grateful for.

Not bad.\n ChatGPT:\n Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, today, we present a compelling case that the three-hour delay in President Trump's response to the events of January 6th is, without a doubt, overwhelming and irrefutable evidence of his planning and conducting the insurrection that unfolded before our eyes.\n First, consider the timeline. As the violence escalated, President Trump did not immediately call for an end to the chaos. This delay allowed the mob to wreak havoc, endanger lives, and damage our democracy. A leader's duty is to protect the nation and its citizens, and a three-hour wait to act is inexplicable unless there was intent behind it.\n Second, let's talk about intent. In criminal law, intent matters. It's the difference between an accident and a crime. A deliberate delay in response to an unfolding insurrection suggests a guilty mind. President Trump had the power and the responsibility to intervene immediately. Yet, he chose not to, allowing the violence to escalate.\n Furthermore, we must consider his words leading up to and during the events of January 6th. His rhetoric could be interpreted as encouragement for his supporters to take matters into their own hands. This, coupled with the delay, paints a picture of a leader who not only knew what was happening but may have orchestrated it.\n Ladies and gentlemen, we are not here to pass judgment but to seek justice. The evidence of a three-hour delay in responding to the insurrection, along with the surrounding circumstances, presents a compelling case that President Trump planned and conducted this insurrection. It is our duty to hold individuals accountable for their actions, regardless of their position.\n    submitted by    /u/Georgeo57  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "In less than a year since ChatGPT was introduced, it has become the fastest consumer application to register 100 million monthly active users. But how are consumers using other GenAI products apart from ChatGPT? An a16z Consumer report examines the top 50 GenAI web products (based on SimilarWeb data) to find out.\n To stay on top of the latest advancements in AI, look here first.\n https://preview.redd.it/f0kh5qag16ob1.png?width=2058&format=png&auto=webp&s=1cab11a31d384c068912c9fca32a000393b795d5\n  \nProprietary models are dominating: 80% of the top 50 GenAI products didn’t exist a year ago—suggesting many of the most compelling consumer experiences are completely novel. Interestingly, 48% of these are bootstrapped—with no outside funding.\n ChatGPT holds a massive lead: ChatGPT alone accounts for 60% of the entire list's monthly traffic, with roughly 1.6 billion visits and 200 million monthly users as of June 2023.\n LLM assistants are dominating: LLMs, including Google’s Bard and Quora’s Poe, constitute 68% of total consumer traffic to the top 50. The other categories seeing significant traffic are AI companions and content-generation tools.\n GenAI marketing is mostly organic: Marketing for most of these products has been reliant on referrals, word of mouth, and other traditional marketing as they enter the market. About 90% of these companies are already monetizing, and most do so via a subscription model.\n GenAI and mobile adaptability: Given the extensive consumer time spent on mobile, an increase in mobile-first GenAI products is expected as the technology evolves.\n  \n(source)\n P.S.

Users can buy, sell, request, and subscribe to data/datasets (and soon even train their ML/AI models using other users' datasets). One of our key features is the request feature, which allows users to submit data requests for free. These requests include descriptions, required fields, geographical scope, budget etc... Once a request is posted, it's sent to numerous companies, organizations, and data vendors that have the potential to fulfill it.\n I understand how frustrating the data acquisition process can be, so I designed this platform to be your one-stop shop for all data-related transactions. You no longer have to spend weeks or months dealing with different vendors and companies through slow emails. With our platform, you can request, negotiate, and purchase data all in one place, and it's completely free to post a request, by the way.\n We've already achieved some successes, and we hope to help more people access the datasets they need. After all, the best AI models are built on diverse and differentiating data. We've had some notable achievements, and we're eager to see if we can fulfill even more interesting dataset requests!\n    submitted by    /u/nobilis_rex_  \n [link]   [comments]",

Twenty-five D1 chips are combined to create a Dojo training tile, which could expedite Tesla’s move towards earning revenue from vehicle software.\n  \nFuture Plans and Implications\n  \nTesla could potentially become an AI-as-a-service provider to automakers in need of FSD capabilities with Dojo.\n As the development of Dojo continues, Tesla has invested in alternative AI infrastructures, including a cluster of 10,000 of Nvidia's most potent H100 accelerators.\n  \n(source)\n P.S.

Apple's investment in its \"Ajax\" AI model signifies the increasing race to advanced AI.\n This move by Meta represents the ongoing trend of tech conglomerates expanding in the AI space, a fact revealed through Google and Microsoft’s use of AI in their productivity tools and Amazon's ongoing developments.\n  \n(source)\n P.S.

          "description": "Based on a bit of research and a lot of gut feeling, I offer the following speculation:\n  \nif you self-trained an LLM with a Python interpreter or Java compiler in a feedback loop where it learned from its own mistakes then it could become dramatically better at coding. It's actually a miracle that they are \"decent\" at coding despite getting virtually no feedback from an interpreter or compiler.\n one could train not merely on input and output, but also on an execution trace so the LLM learned HOW the interpreter got the result\n one could also train the model on how to install and invoke open source software and thus it would learn about a variety of languages, versions and runtimes\n this might also improve its logical reasoning skills in general\n  \nAdmittedly, running programs is a lot more expensive than doing simple next-word prediction on pre-existing texts.\n But on the other hand, a corpus of a million program executions can also be used to train future LLMs. You can keep the execution information forever and re-use it as traditional next-token prediction input.\n    submitted by    /u/Smallpaul  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Learning a skill, for me, was never about securing knowledge that privileged me over everyone else who did not put the work in. While often, it did feel like drinking Kool-Aid, buying in to these groups like yoga and climbing, I knew I was not there to rub elbows, but to discover the how behind it. Some leaders of some groups did create a barrier of entry, a necessary proving point, but I have always seen these loops to jump through as a challenge - once completed - a spy. Every skill you have learned has prepared you not to be better at that skill, but to learn a new skill with more ease. It is uncomfortable to learn something new, like drinking from a fire hydrant, but the more sips you take from that blasting surge of water, the more you realize it is all part of the process. We get blasted, we sip, we get overwhelmed, we come back. Just because there is a tool that regulates the blasting, that holds our hand through the overwhelm, does not mean all our hard work has been for nothing. In fact, it means we are more prepared, more primed, to receive all of the beauty and knowledge coming our way. Now, friends, we become CURATORS. :) xo\n    submitted by    /u/airkaty  \n [link]   [comments]",

Technically, is this a way for a computer to input language of a person and then convert it into machine code (0s and 1s)? Or, is this a way to turn human language into some computer language like Python, and then turn into machine code as a second step?\n I am assuming that NLP has only just recently become widely used (like in Chat GPT). Was it a huge jump to go from a machine understanding a computer programming language like Python to a machine understanding ordinary human language? Why was it so much more difficult to train computers to understand the later?\n Thanks!\n    submitted by    /u/NoahsArkJP  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I've been playing around with pruning neural networks. One interesting thing I've found is that pruning the weights with the lowest L1-norm along a specific dimension seems to give better results than simply pruning all of the weights with the lowest L1-norm (which I believe is the standard method; for example this is what torch.nn.utils.prune.l1_unstructured does).\n Does anyone have an explanation for why this might be, or knows of any research in this area?\n I'm aware that structured pruning removes entire channels in a specific dimension. But I'm referring to unstructured pruning here, where I remove a subset of the weights along a specific dimension.\n Admittedly I've only done very limited benchmarking of this.

If so I have trouble finding a way of implementing it but that is an other story. Right know I want to know if this is doable ?

          "description": "Suppose that we have a function f(I) that transforms the an RGB image I of size WxH in another RGB image O of size WxH (one example of f could be RGB to gray scale conversion, where O is such that for every pixel i, Ri=Gi=Bi). Suppose that the function f requires seconds of computations on an average PC. My goal is to understand if a neural network can learn f and be faster than f itself, given the fact that a training dataset of pairs (Ii, Oi) (in the thousands or even in the millions) is easy to create.

I have basic coding skills but other than that no experience with neural networks.\n What I'd like to do is take an existing input data set and then use a neutral net to build a model based on manual training data. If anyone could give me help on how to start / even a full explanation of the way a noob like me could accomplish this, that would be great. Otherwise if anyone can point me to a list of resources that are able to comprehensively explain the process, that would also be great! Again sorry if this is the wrong subreddit, if this is the wrong place for this can someone please direct me to the right place to ask this question.

The most commonly-used paradigm for learning DNNs is empirical risk minimization (ERM), which aims to identify a network that minimizes the average loss on training data points. Several algorithms, including stochastic gradient descent (SGD), Adam, and Adagrad, have been proposed for solving ERM. However, a drawback of ERM is that it weights all the samples equally, often ignoring the rare and more difficult samples, and focusing on the easier and abundant samples.

Determining the best route from A to B requires making complex trade-offs between factors including the estimated time of arrival (ETA), tolls, directness, surface conditions (e.g., paved, unpaved roads), and user preferences, which vary across transportation mode and local geography. Often, the most natural visibility we have into travelers' preferences is by analyzing real-world travel patterns.\n\n\n\nLearning preferences from observed sequential decision making behavior is a classic application of inverse reinforcement learning (IRL).

DP algorithms are randomized to protect user data by ensuring that the probability of any particular output is nearly unchanged when a data point is added or removed. Therefore, the output of a DP algorithm does not disclose the presence of any one data point. There has been significant progress in both foundational research and adoption of differential privacy with contributions such as the Privacy Sandbox and Google Open Source Library.\n\n\nML and data analytics algorithms can often be described as performing multiple basic computation steps on the same dataset.

If we apply the definitions of Q'(x, a_1, a_2) and Q(x, a_1, a_2) to get the bound, P_{xy}^2(a_2) and R_x(a_2) should not be there. Are they just notation errors or is it correct and I'm missing something?\n ​\n 2) I don't quite get how the bounds on P and R are computed in Section 3.2:\n https://preview.redd.it/p06ysjewqwqb1.png?width=962&format=png&auto=webp&s=a5929e701099dc6e4543efe7681f96f12f543fa8\n Considering the results in B.4 (i.e., the bounds for the distance between the chain's P, R and the real ones), I don't understand how they arrive at this conclusion. \n ​\n I'd greatly appreciate any intuitions about these, or if someone can point me in the right direction :)\n    submitted by    /u/Beautiful_Zebra_198  \n [link]   [comments]",

I give the episode reward for every action EXCEPT the \"end early\" action, now I will need to give some boost for shorter episodes to achieve the desired effect :) \n I feel like I'm experiencing déjà vu, posing another DQN-related question. But, here's my issue:\n I've set up an environment where an agent can interact for 40 steps or choose to end the interaction early with a specific action. The catch is that the reward is only given at the end of the episode, which seems to be leading the agent to strongly favor the \"end early\" action. Despite all other steps getting a reward of 0, I assumed the long-term reward estimate, V(s_{t+1}), would mitigate this, but the agent still heavily gravitates towards ending the episode early.\n Attempted Solutions:\n  \nDistributed the end-of-episode reward across all prior actions taken by the agent.\n  \nConsidering:\n  \nReplacing the \"end early\" action with a \"do nothing\" action, allowing the episode to always play out in full.

          "description": "I learned about DeepNash and R-NaD yesterday. I read the Deepmind article, Science paper, and the source code of rnad.py. But I don't think I understand it! Part of this is that they didn't define all the terms and Greek they use in the paper, and part of it is that I don't have academic ML experience.\n Below is my attempt to summarize the paper in non-academic terms. I'm trying to show that I did my homework, and also I'm trying to invoke Godwin's Law in the hopes that someone will come along and correct me.\n Here goes:\n Naïve reinforcement learning doesn't work with simultaneous choice games such as matching pennies or Rock-Paper-Scissors.\n In naïve RL, If I choose Rock as my move, my opponent chooses Scissors as their move, and I see that I won, that will reinforce a belief that Rock is a \"good\" move and Scissors is a \"bad\" move. But this isn't true!\n This means that, during selfplay, a naïve RL agent will just cycle through strategies, as the timestep-(τ_n) agent learns how to beat the timestep-(τ_n-1) agent. The agent will never learn that RPS is a game about staying unpredictable!\n R-NaD fixes this by adjusting the reward function. I think \"regularizing\" is ML-academic speak for \"adjusting\". It adjusts the reward function in such a way that the agent will converge at a Nash equilibrium strategy.\n The paper's equation (1) describes how the regularization works. They didn't explain all the terms, though. I still don't know what a_i represents. But I think it corresponds to parts of the code like this line and this line.\n The key is that we're merging policies from multiple epochs and making sure that the current agent's move probabilities fare well against not only itself, but also against its previous two generations. They've proven that three generations is all you need to eventually converge to a Nash equilibrium.\n So... that's my understanding. Does anyone with actual ML experience want to weigh in?\n    submitted by    /u/lord_braleigh  \n [link]   [comments]",

Due to some of the problems associated with highly complex models and sample efficiency, I also thought about training the model using imitation learning first (which should be no problem with policy gradient methods afaik, though some slight adjustments would have to be made). For context, I'm thinking on benchmarking the approach using AlphaStar unplugged.\n However, when looking at current literature, only very few papers directly use transformers this way. Transformers seem to be very sample efficient and to generalize very well, but they are still only really used in a purely offline context (sometimes without directly using RL-techniques, such as with the Decision Transformer). And, if they are used in an online context, then only in some really intricate combination with other models (such as in AlphaStar). \n Is there a reason why the approach I am currently considering is not popular in literature?

But I find it very difficult to tune.\n I mean I tuned and programmed successfully various algorithm such as different GAN that are not necessarily very easy to tune. RL algorithm seems even worse.\n I tried several grid world problems, cart pole and even a very simple second order system regulation (integrator + 1 st order pôle). \n Even the Matlab cart pole demo with ddqn does not provide a very satisfactory result (after training, the contrôler keep the pendulum in uprigth position, but the cart slowly drift).\n On the second order system, the learning seems ok for about 200 épisode(test shows that the expected behavior is almost learnt) and then suddenly the average episode score has a kind of inflection and everything blowns up, despite a very large replay buffer.\n So my question : is it possible to make dqn and ddqn work well with a reasonable tuning session length? Are policy optimization easier to tune (and/or more efficient)? So far, it seems to me that these action-vzlue based algorithms are highly unstable and the training may only works for a 'miraculous' tunning.

I have aquired so much knowledge in the data science field and truth be told I love it, it engages my mind like crazy so I've decided that i would like my career to be revolved around electronics and programming/ data science.\n Back to the topic, I am working on object detection (I got it figured out), and reinforcement learning, so what I would like to do is to train the model on reaching it's destination using collision avoidance, I have a PIX4, RPI 4B 4GBs since I'm also building my drone from scratch, so let's say I have all the hardware which ofcourse includes the GPS + Compass and 5 ultrasonic sensors, 1 at each side and 1 down to hold the altitude accurately. I was thinking of HITL, making a virtual environment to train my model there because this is what logic says, ofcourse( I could also fly it using the RC controller and for example test if the obstacle avoidance is going to overrule the manual drive, which is also my objective). The question is: how can I make sure virtual drone is going to be equipped with the real-life sensors and in the needed positions? How can I feed all the sensors data during the training? Which type of reinforcement learning models should I implement? \n I just feel like I dragged myself into an incredibly amazing and complex project which is going to end up fucking my semester and I won't be able to graduate, it's just that my stress now is skyrocketing. \n Please feel free to throw any advice or opinions my way, and thank you for keeping up with this long post. 😁\n    submitted by    /u/Gabii99  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I am trying to build intuition on why the actor update equation actually help the actor improving its policy. From what I understand, the update is proportional to the Critic's TD error. A better than expected reward will lead the actor to increase the prob of taking the associated action, and a disappointing reward will make the actor to move away from the given action.\n Here's where I feel like I'm missing a piece of the puzzle. Between a good state/action pair accurately valued by the Critic and a bad state/action pair undervalued by the Critic, the actor's update will favor the bad action more. Could we not conceive a scenario in which the agent gets stuck in a suboptimal policy because of that particular behavior?\n What triggers this questioning is that I have implemented a standard AC algo for Pixelcopter and found my agent getting stuck easily on a suboptimal policy (i.e. constantly getting higher, or lower until crash, while the critics assign good values on center squares and bad values to squares close to the wall's edge). For TD0, this is pretty marginal, but gets more significant for n-step TD as n increases.\n Any thoughts?\n    submitted by    /u/infundibuliforme  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I was thinking of some major challenges in modeling a generic real-world environment. Some of them are: adaptive agents, uncertain intentions, and lack of common knowledge.\n However, most of the papers I see on RL make some assumption or other violating one or more of these, like considering simple agents, assuming known knowledge about others' intentions, and considering that the models of other agents are known when irl an agent hardly has a model of other agents it interacts with apriori. \n Consider an airport scenario where agents are trying to get into respective planes within a given time, and the gates to each plane allow one person at a time. Looking at the scenario from the view of a single agent, they know what they want, but they can't really make any assumptions about the intentions, strategy, and complexity of other agents beforehand. These other agents can be neutral or adversarial (competing for getting in the same plane) from the agent's viewpoint. All they can see is a restricted view of the motions of some of the other agents.\n What would you say could model and provide a solution in such a scenario? It is to be noted that other agents can change their strategies based on actions taken by you till now, and so can you. Due to having incomplete information, I fail to see the notion of an equilibrium, and the agents needn't be fully rational as well.\n    submitted by    /u/Quirky_Concoction  \n [link]   [comments]",

An abstraction of the game would be like:\n There are two players: player A and player B. At the start of each turn, each player chooses an action between 3 possible actions. If player A chose a specific action (let's say action 1), the game asks player B to make a decision (let's say block or not block) and vice versa. Actions are calculated. Next turn starts.\n What would be a good approach to handle that? I thought of two possible solutions: 1. Anticipate the possibility of that mid turn decision beforehand adding a new dimension to the actions space (e.g. take action 3; if opponent takes action 1, block). That sounds that it could create credit assignment problems e.g. giving credit to the second action when it actually didn't happen. 2. Make two policies with shared value functions. That sounds complicated and I saw that previous works like DeepNash actually did that, but I don't know what problems could arise from that.\n Opinions/suggestions?

Each bid is represented as a vector of length 10, with 5 values indicating the price and the other 5 indicating the quantity of electricity. For instance, given a sample action vector [w, x, y, z, ...], it operates as follows: if the price is greater than w, buy/sell x units of electricity, if the price is greater than y, buy/sell z units of electricity, and so forth. I possess three years' worth of data, including crucial features like weather conditions, coal prices, wind speed, net load, forecasted load, locational marginal price, and more.\n Initially, I trained a Deep Q-Network (DQN) to tackle this problem, and it's performing quite well. However, the DQN provides a scalar action for each hour, neglecting price points. It acts regardless of the price. I'm aware that I can explore solutions like Proximal Policy Gradient to generate a vector action that includes both electricity unit amounts and prices.\n I have three questions:\n  \nIs it possible to solve this problem using Dynamic Programming techniques? While I understand it's not an exceedingly difficult problem, can I expect some results if I attempt to apply DP?\n \nHow challenging might it be to output a vector instead of a scalar, with the vector being monotonically increasing? What's the recommended approach for a problem of this nature? Is it worthwhile to explore RL and specifically Proximal Policy Optimization?\n \nHow would you approach such a problem while keeping it simple and avoiding unnecessary complexity? \n \n Any guidance or insights would be greatly appreciated.\n    submitted by    /u/uonliaquat  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I'm looking for some ideas on Multi Agent RL that preferably involve Robotics. I've came up with two ideas based on essentially similar themes: \n 1) Multiple robots tasked with cleaning a large room (with obstacles)\n 2) Multiple robots tasked with a search and rescue like mission in a particular area. \n Both are basically applications of n agents trying to collectively cover a region. \n Can someone recommend some frameworks and libraries that can allow me to simulate these ideas? Also, I'd love to hear some other ideas as well which use multi-agent RL for robotic applications. For now I'm only targeting a simulation based project. If I get time later I'd love to implement them on hardware as well. Thanks in advance!\n    submitted by    /u/esem29  \n [link]   [comments]",

( https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.09533 ) The paper shows that simply applying PPO to the SMAC task to construct an IPPO (independent PPO) algorithm like IQL can surpass QMIX on SMAC. IPPO demonstrates the effectiveness of applying PPO to multi-agent systems.\n The paper further extends IPPO to MAPPO. The difference is that the critic of PPO uses the global state instead of the observation as input. Surprisingly, the global information does not enhance the actual performance of IPPO.\n ​\n https://preview.redd.it/1wqqlj9z05nb1.png?width=1440&format=png&auto=webp&s=0d6ca1faa0e872151abdb6bb1e48884c6b51e71a\n ​\n https://preview.redd.it/ei9uacl015nb1.png?width=1440&fo…",

I don’t intend to spend hundreds of hours to master the base, so I decided to try something like RARL so that this thing would learn, and I could analyze its moves, change the conditions and thus start playing at an intermediate level faster.\n However, a superficial analysis revealed that the game does not have an API at all. Let's say I could grab some stats using Cheat Engine and OllyDbg, but I have no idea how to fit it into the gym. Or does gym as env need to pass a link to the client from the machine so that it only restarts it?\n In general, if anyone has done something similar, I ask for a link to a guide or a similar example.\n All the best\n    submitted by    /u/kapedalex  \n [link]   [comments]",

The environment is a node removal ('n' number of actions which are nodes on the graph) with evaluation after each node removed. the state is represented by a trained graph attention network in the environment with the average of the node embeddings on the graph representing the state of dimension size 'n'. The embedding of the a node that has been removed is subtracted from overall graph embedding representation to represent the 'removal' of that node. \n However, I want to absolutely be certain, that given a state representation, in a new unseen graph, the agent will not select a node that is absent from that graph. In the event that the state representation may not be granular enough and might cause the agent to think that a node on the graph is present when it is not, are there ways to mitigate this? Two ideas I have are:\n  \nmask actions for nodes that are not present (this is already done after node removal to prevent the agent from selecting the same node again), but is this valid to do in an unseen graph if I a priori mask nodes that are not present in the action space\n Inject a second input to the policy network such as a one-hot encoding of nodes that have already been selected as an input in addition to the state representation of the graph, so that it models finer dependencies between the state and action taken. However is this valid? \n  \nAny thoughts are appreciated! thank you!\n    submitted by    /u/amjass12  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I am struggling to understand one part of the FAQ of the transformer reinforcement learning library from HuggingFace:\n  \nWhat Is the Concern with Negative KL Divergence?\n If you generate text by purely sampling from the model distribution things work fine in general. But when you use the generate method there are a few caveats because it does not always purely sample depending on the settings which can cause KL-divergence to go negative. Essentially when the active model achieves log_p_token_active < log_p_token_ref we get negative KL-div. This can happen in a several cases:\n top-k sampling: the model can smooth out the probability distribution causing the top-k tokens having a smaller probability than those of the reference model but they still are selected\n min_length: this ignores the EOS token until min_length is reached. thus the model can assign a very high log prob to the EOS token and very low prob to all others until min_length is reached\n batched generation: finished sequences in a batch are padded until all generations are finished. The model can learn to assign very low probabilities to the padding tokens unless they are properly masked or removed.These are just a few examples. Why is negative KL an issue? The total reward R is computed R = r - beta * KL so if the model can learn how to drive KL-divergence negative it effectively gets a positive reward. In many cases it can be much easier to exploit such a bug in the generation than actually learning the reward function. In addition the KL can become arbitrarily small thus the actual reward can be very small compared to it.\n  \nI understand why the KL-divergence that is computed here is an approximation that can be negative as opposed to the real one. However, I cannot wrap my head around the details of why these specific sampling parameters would lead to negative KL-divergence. Could someone elaborate on these points?\n    submitted by    /u/Loud_Appointment_418  \n [link]   [comments]",
