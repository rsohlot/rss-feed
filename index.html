                    <span>Extending the forecasting time is a critical demand for real applications,
such as extreme weather early warning and long-term energy consumption
planning. This paper studies the long-term forecasting problem of time series.
Prior Transformer-based models adopt various self-attention mechanisms to
discover the long-range dependencies. However, intricate temporal patterns of
the long-term future prohibit the model from finding reliable dependencies.
Also, Transformers have to adopt the sparse versions of point-wise
self-attentions for long series efficiency, resulting in the information
utilization bottleneck. Going beyond Transformers, we design Autoformer as a
novel decomposition architecture with an Auto-Correlation mechanism. We break
with the pre-processing convention of series decomposition and renovate it as a
basic inner block of deep models. This design empowers Autoformer with
progressive decomposition capacities for complex time series. Further, inspired
by the stochastic process theory, we design the Auto-Correlation mechanism
based on the series periodicity, which conducts the dependencies discovery and
representation aggregation at the sub-series level. Auto-Correlation
outperforms self-attention in both efficiency and accuracy. In long-term
forecasting, Autoformer yields state-of-the-art accuracy, with a 38% relative
improvement on six benchmarks, covering five practical applications: energy,
traffic, economics, weather and disease. Code is available at this repository:

                    <span>Recent advances in AIoT technologies have led to an increasing popularity of
utilizing machine learning algorithms to detect operational failures for
cyber-physical systems (CPS). In its basic form, an anomaly detection module
monitors the sensor measurements and actuator states from the physical plant,
and detects anomalies in these measurements to identify abnormal operation
status. Nevertheless, building effective anomaly detection models for CPS is
rather challenging as the model has to accurately detect anomalies in presence
of highly complicated system dynamics and unknown amount of sensor noise. In
this work, we propose a novel time series anomaly detection method called
Neural System Identification and Bayesian Filtering (NSIBF) in which a
specially crafted neural network architecture is posed for system
identification, i.e., capturing the dynamics of CPS in a dynamical state-space
model; then a Bayesian filtering algorithm is naturally applied on top of the
&quot;identified&quot; state-space model for robust anomaly detection by tracking the
uncertainty of the hidden state of the system recursively over time. We provide
qualitative as well as quantitative experiments with the proposed method on a
synthetic and three real-world CPS datasets, showing that NSIBF compares
favorably to the state-of-the-art methods with considerable improvements on
anomaly detection in CPS.</span>

                    <span>Deep neural networks (DNNs) have achieved the state of the art performance in
numerous fields. However, DNNs need high computation times, and people always
expect better performance in a lower computation. Therefore, we study the human
somatosensory system and design a neural network (SpinalNet) to achieve higher
accuracy with fewer computations. Hidden layers in traditional NNs receive
inputs in the previous layer, apply activation function, and then transfer the
outcomes to the next layer. In the proposed SpinalNet, each layer is split into
three splits: 1) input split, 2) intermediate split, and 3) output split. Input
split of each layer receives a part of the inputs. The intermediate split of
each layer receives outputs of the intermediate split of the previous layer and
outputs of the input split of the current layer. The number of incoming weights
becomes significantly lower than traditional DNNs. The SpinalNet can also be
used as the fully connected or classification layer of DNN and supports both
traditional learning and transfer learning. We observe significant error
reductions with lower computational costs in most of the DNNs. Traditional
learning on the VGG-5 network with SpinalNet classification layers provided the
state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on QMNIST, Kuzushiji-MNIST, EMNIST
(Letters, Digits, and Balanced) datasets. Traditional learning with ImageNet
pre-trained initial weights and SpinalNet classification layers provided the
SOTA performance on STL-10, Fruits 360, Bird225, and Caltech-101 datasets. The
scripts of the proposed SpinalNet are available at the following link:

                    <span>Collaborating with humans requires rapidly adapting to their individual
strengths, weaknesses, and preferences. Unfortunately, most standard
multi-agent reinforcement learning techniques, such as self-play (SP) or
population play (PP), produce agents that overfit to their training partners
and do not generalize well to humans. Alternatively, researchers can collect
human data, train a human model using behavioral cloning, and then use that
model to train &quot;human-aware&quot; agents (&quot;behavioral cloning play&quot;, or BCP). While
such an approach can improve the generalization of agents to new human
co-players, it involves the onerous and expensive step of collecting large
amounts of human data first. Here, we study the problem of how to train agents
that collaborate well with human partners without using human data. We argue
that the crux of the problem is to produce a diverse set of training partners.
Drawing inspiration from successful multi-agent approaches in competitive
domains, we find that a surprisingly simple approach is highly effective. We
train our agent partner as the best response to a population of self-play
agents and their past checkpoints taken throughout training, a method we call
Fictitious Co-Play (FCP). Our experiments focus on a two-player collaborative
cooking simulator that has recently been proposed as a challenge problem for
coordination with humans. We find that FCP agents score significantly higher
than SP, PP, and BCP when paired with novel agent and human partners.
Furthermore, humans also report a strong subjective preference to partnering
with FCP agents over all baselines.</span>

                    <span>Column generation is an iterative method used to solve a variety of
optimization problems. It decomposes the problem into two parts: a master
problem, and one or more pricing problems (PP). The total computing time taken
by the method is divided between these two parts. In routing or scheduling
applications, the problems are mostly defined on a network, and the PP is
usually an NP-hard shortest path problem with resource constraints. In this
work, we propose a new heuristic pricing algorithm based on machine learning.
By taking advantage of the data collected during previous executions, the
objective is to reduce the size of the network and accelerate the PP, keeping
only the arcs that have a high chance to be part of the linear relaxation
solution. The method has been applied to two specific problems: the vehicle and
crew scheduling problem in public transit and the vehicle routing problem with
time windows. Reductions in computational time of up to 40% can be obtained.</span>

                    <span>This article studies the estimation of community memberships from non-binary
pair interactions represented by an $N$-by-$N$ tensor whose values are elements
of $\mathcal S$, where $N$ is the number of nodes and $\mathcal S$ is the space
of the pairwise interactions between the nodes. As an information-theoretic
benchmark, we study data sets generated by a non-binary stochastic block model,
and derive fundamental information criteria for the recovery of the community
memberships as $N \to \infty$. Examples of applications include weighted
networks ($\mathcal S &#x3D; \mathbb R$), link-labeled networks $(\mathcal S &#x3D; \{0,
1, \dots, L\}$), multiplex networks $(\mathcal S &#x3D; \{0,1\}^M$) and temporal
networks ($\mathcal S &#x3D; \{0,1\}^T$).

For temporal interactions, we show that (i) even a small increase in $T$ may
have a big impact on the recovery of community memberships, (ii) consistent
recovery is possible even for very sparse data (e.g.\ bounded average degree)
when $T$ is large enough. We also present several estimation algorithms, both
offline and online, which fully utilise the temporal nature of the observed
data. We analyse the accuracy of the proposed estimation algorithms under
various assumptions on data sparsity and identifiability. Numerical experiments
show that even a poor initial estimate (e.g., blind random guess) of the
community assignment leads to high accuracy obtained by the online algorithm
after a small number of iterations, and remarkably so also in very sparse
regimes.</span>

                    <span>This paper proposes a novel acoustic word embedding called Acoustic Neighbor
Embeddings where speech or text of arbitrary length are mapped to a vector
space of fixed, reduced dimensions by adapting stochastic neighbor embedding
(SNE) to sequential inputs. The Euclidean distance between coordinates in the
embedding space reflects the phonetic confusability between their corresponding
sequences. Two encoder neural networks are trained: an acoustic encoder that
accepts speech signals in the form of frame-wise subword posterior
probabilities obtained from an acoustic model and a text encoder that accepts
text in the form of subword transcriptions. Compared to a triplet loss
criterion, the proposed method is shown to have more effective gradients for
neural network training. Experimentally, it also gives more accurate results
with low-dimensional embeddings when the two encoder networks are used in
tandem in a word (name) recognition task, and when the text encoder network is
used standalone in an approximate phonetic matching task. In particular, in an
isolated name recognition task depending solely on Euclidean nearest-neighbor
search between the proposed embedding vectors, the recognition accuracy is
identical to that of conventional finite state transducer(FST)-based decoding
using test data with up to 1 million names in the vocabulary and 40 dimensions
in the embeddings.</span>

                    <span>Deep reinforcement learning has gathered much attention recently. Impressive
results were achieved in activities as diverse as autonomous driving, game
playing, molecular recombination, and robotics. In all these fields, computer
programs have taught themselves to solve difficult problems. They have learned
to fly model helicopters and perform aerobatic manoeuvers such as loops and
rolls. In some applications they have even become better than the best humans,
such as in Atari, Go, poker and StarCraft. The way in which deep reinforcement
learning explores complex environments reminds us of how children learn, by
playfully trying out things, getting feedback, and trying again. The computer
seems to truly possess aspects of human learning; this goes to the heart of the
dream of artificial intelligence. The successes in research have not gone
unnoticed by educators, and universities have started to offer courses on the
subject. The aim of this book is to provide a comprehensive overview of the
field of deep reinforcement learning. The book is written for graduate students
of artificial intelligence, and for researchers and practitioners who wish to
better understand deep reinforcement learning methods and their challenges. We
assume an undergraduate-level of understanding of computer science and
artificial intelligence; the programming language of this book is Python. We
describe the foundations, the algorithms and the applications of deep
reinforcement learning. We cover the established model-free and model-based
methods that form the basis of the field. Developments go quickly, and we also
cover advanced topics: deep multi-agent reinforcement learning, deep
hierarchical reinforcement learning, and deep meta learning.</span>

                    <span>Extracting spatial-temporal knowledge from data is useful in many
applications. It is important that the obtained knowledge is
human-interpretable and amenable to formal analysis. In this paper, we propose
a method that trains neural networks to learn spatial-temporal properties in
the form of weighted graph-based signal temporal logic (wGSTL) formulas. For
learning wGSTL formulas, we introduce a flexible wGSTL formula structure in
which the user&#x27;s preference can be applied in the inferred wGSTL formulas. In
the proposed framework, each neuron of the neural networks corresponds to a
subformula in a flexible wGSTL formula structure. We initially train a neural
network to learn the wGSTL operators and then train a second neural network to
learn the parameters in a flexible wGSTL formula structure. We use a COVID-19
dataset and a rain prediction dataset to evaluate the performance of the
proposed framework and algorithms. We compare the performance of the proposed
framework with three baseline classification methods including K-nearest
neighbors, decision trees, support vector machine, and artificial neural
networks. The classification accuracy obtained by the proposed framework is
comparable with the baseline classification methods.</span>

                    <span>Deep autoencoders are often extended with a supervised or adversarial loss to
learn latent representations with desirable properties, such as greater
predictivity of labels and outcomes or fairness with respects to a sensitive
variable. Despite the ubiquity of supervised and adversarial deep latent factor
models, these methods should demonstrate improvement over simpler linear
approaches to be preferred in practice. This necessitates a reproducible linear
analog that still adheres to an augmenting supervised or adversarial objective.
We address this methodological gap by presenting methods that augment the
principal component analysis (PCA) objective with either a supervised or an
adversarial objective and provide analytic and reproducible solutions. We
implement these methods in an open-source Python package, AugmentedPCA, that
can produce excellent real-world baselines. We demonstrate the utility of these
factor models on an open-source, RNA-seq cancer gene expression dataset,
showing that augmenting with a supervised objective results in improved
downstream classification performance, produces principal components with
greater class fidelity, and facilitates identification of genes aligned with
the principal axes of data variance with implications to development of
specific types of cancer.</span>

different datasets due to their versatility. However, as one increases the size
of the dataset, the computation time for training and using these statistical
models grows quickly. Quantum computing offers a new paradigm which may have
the ability to overcome these computational difficulties. Here, we propose a
quantum analogue to K-means clustering, implement it on simulated
superconducting qubits, and compare it to a previously developed quantum
support vector machine. We find the algorithm&#x27;s accuracy comparable to the
classical K-means algorithm for clustering and classification problems, and
find that it has asymptotic complexity $O(N^{3/2}K^{1/2}\log{P})$, where $N$ is
the number of data points, $K$ is the number of clusters, and $P$ is the
dimension of the data points, giving a significant speedup over the classical

                    <span>This paper presents a new Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS) based on
Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). GNNs are a relatively new sub-field of deep
neural networks, which can leverage the inherent structure of graph-based data.
Training and evaluation data for NIDSs are typically represented as flow
records, which can naturally be represented in a graph format. In this paper,
we propose E-GraphSAGE, a GNN approach that allows capturing both the edge
features of a graph as well as the topological information for network
intrusion detection in IoT networks. To the best of our knowledge, our proposal
is the first successful, practical, and extensively evaluated approach of
applying GNNs on the problem of network intrusion detection for IoT using
flow-based data. Our extensive experimental evaluation on four recent NIDS
benchmark datasets shows that our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art in
terms of key classification metrics, which demonstrates the potential of GNNs
in network intrusion detection, and provides motivation for further research.</span>

workflow, in situ processing is first utilized to extract Lagrangian flow maps,
and deep neural networks then use the extracted data to learn flow field
behavior. Using a trained model to predict new particle trajectories offers a
fixed small memory footprint and fast inference. To demonstrate and evaluate
the proposed method, we perform an in-depth study of performance using a
well-known analytical data set, the Double Gyre. Our study considers two flow
map extraction strategies as well as the impact of the number of training
samples and integration durations on efficacy, evaluates multiple sampling
options for training and testing and informs hyperparameter settings. Overall,
we find our method requires a fixed memory footprint of 10.5 MB to encode a
Lagrangian representation of a time-varying vector field while maintaining
accuracy. For post hoc analysis, loading the trained model costs only two
seconds, significantly reducing the burden of I/O when reading data for
visualization. Moreover, our parallel implementation can infer one hundred
locations for each of two thousand new pathlines across the entire temporal
resolution in 1.3 seconds using one NVIDIA Titan RTX GPU.</span>

                    <span>In this paper, we present connections between three models used in different
research fields: weighted finite automata~(WFA) from formal languages and
linguistics, recurrent neural networks used in machine learning, and tensor
networks which encompasses a set of optimization techniques for high-order
tensors used in quantum physics and numerical analysis. We first present an
intrinsic relation between WFA and the tensor train decomposition, a particular
form of tensor network. This relation allows us to exhibit a novel low rank
structure of the Hankel matrix of a function computed by a WFA and to design an
efficient spectral learning algorithm leveraging this structure to scale the
algorithm up to very large Hankel matrices.We then unravel a fundamental
connection between WFA and second-orderrecurrent neural networks~(2-RNN): in
the case of sequences of discrete symbols, WFA and 2-RNN with linear
activationfunctions are expressively equivalent. Leveraging this equivalence
result combined with the classical spectral learning algorithm for weighted
automata, we introduce the first provable learning algorithm for linear 2-RNN
defined over sequences of continuous input vectors.This algorithm relies on
estimating low rank sub-blocks of the Hankel tensor, from which the parameters
of a linear 2-RNN can be provably recovered. The performances of the proposed
learning algorithm are assessed in a simulation study on both synthetic and
real-world data.</span>

from the perspective of statistical learning theory, modelled, in a simplified
setting, as a continuous-time stochastic recurrent neural network (RNN) with
identity activation function. In the purely stochastic (robust) regime, we give
a generalisation error bound that holds with high probability, thus showing
that the empirical risk minimiser is the best-in-class hypothesis. We show that
RNNs retain a partial signature of the paths they are fed as the unique
information exploited for training and classification tasks. We argue that
these RNNs are easy to train and robust and back these observations with

                    <span>Numerical models based on physics represent the state-of-the-art in earth
system modeling and comprise our best tools for generating insights and
predictions. Despite rapid growth in computational power, the perceived need
for higher model resolutions overwhelms the latest-generation computers,
reducing the ability of modelers to generate simulations for understanding
parameter sensitivities and characterizing variability and uncertainty. Thus,
surrogate models are often developed to capture the essential attributes of the
full-blown numerical models. Recent successes of machine learning methods,
especially deep learning, across many disciplines offer the possibility that
complex nonlinear connectionist representations may be able to capture the
underlying complex structures and nonlinear processes in earth systems. A
difficult test for deep learning-based emulation, which refers to function
approximation of numerical models, is to understand whether they can be
comparable to traditional forms of surrogate models in terms of computational
efficiency while simultaneously reproducing model results in a credible manner.
A deep learning emulation that passes this test may be expected to perform even
better than simple models with respect to capturing complex processes and
spatiotemporal dependencies. Here we examine, with a case study in
satellite-based remote sensing, the hypothesis that deep learning approaches
can credibly represent the simulations from a surrogate model with comparable
computational efficiency. Our results are encouraging in that the deep learning
emulation reproduces the results with acceptable accuracy and often even faster
performance. We discuss the broader implications of our results in light of the
pace of improvements in high-performance implementations of deep learning as
well as the growing desire for higher-resolution simulations in the earth
sciences.</span>

                    <span>Identifying the status of individual network units is critical for
understanding the mechanism of convolutional neural networks (CNNs). However,
it is still challenging to reliably give a general indication of unit status,
especially for units in different network models. To this end, we propose a
novel method for quantitatively clarifying the status of single unit in CNN
using algebraic topological tools. Unit status is indicated via the calculation
of a defined topological-based entropy, called feature entropy, which measures
the degree of chaos of the global spatial pattern hidden in the unit for a
category. In this way, feature entropy could provide an accurate indication of
status for units in different networks with diverse situations like
weight-rescaling operation. Further, we show that feature entropy decreases as
the layer goes deeper and shares almost simultaneous trend with loss during
training. We show that by investigating the feature entropy of units on only
training data, it could give discrimination between networks with different
generalization ability from the view of the effectiveness of feature
representations.</span>

                    <span>Quantum noise is the key challenge in Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ)
computers. Previous work for mitigating noise has primarily focused on
gate-level or pulse-level noise-adaptive compilation. However, limited research
efforts have explored a higher level of optimization by making the quantum
circuits themselves resilient to noise.

We propose QuantumNAS, a comprehensive framework for noise-adaptive co-search
of the variational circuit and qubit mapping. Variational quantum circuits are
a promising approach for constructing QML and quantum simulation. However,
finding the best variational circuit and its optimal parameters is challenging
due to the large design space and parameter training cost. We propose to
decouple the circuit search and parameter training by introducing a novel
SuperCircuit. The SuperCircuit is constructed with multiple layers of
pre-defined parameterized gates and trained by iteratively sampling and
updating the parameter subsets (SubCircuits) of it. It provides an accurate
estimation of SubCircuits performance trained from scratch. Then we perform an
evolutionary co-search of SubCircuit and its qubit mapping. The SubCircuit
performance is estimated with parameters inherited from SuperCircuit and
simulated with real device noise models. Finally, we perform iterative gate
pruning and finetuning to remove redundant gates.

Extensively evaluated with 12 QML and VQE benchmarks on 14 quantum computers,
QuantumNAS significantly outperforms baselines. For QML, QuantumNAS is the
first to demonstrate over 95% 2-class, 85% 4-class, and 32% 10-class
classification accuracy on real QC. It also achieves the lowest eigenvalue for
VQE tasks on H2, H2O, LiH, CH4, BeH2 compared with UCCSD. We also open-source
TorchQuantum (https://github.com/mit-han-lab/torchquantum) for fast training of
parameterized quantum circuits to facilitate future research.</span>

                    <span>Deep learning-based RF fingerprinting has recently been recognized as a
potential solution for enabling newly emerging wireless network applications,
such as spectrum access policy enforcement, automated network device
authentication, and unauthorized network access monitoring and control. Real,
comprehensive RF datasets are now needed more than ever to enable the study,
assessment, and validation of newly developed RF fingerprinting approaches. In
this paper, we present and release a large-scale RF fingerprinting dataset,
collected from 25 different LoRa-enabled IoT transmitting devices using USRP
B210 receivers. Our dataset consists of a large number of SigMF-compliant
binary files representing the I/Q time-domain samples and their corresponding
FFT-based files of LoRa transmissions. This dataset provides a comprehensive
set of essential experimental scenarios, considering both indoor and outdoor
environments and various network deployments and configurations, such as the
distance between the transmitters and the receiver, the configuration of the
considered LoRa modulation, the physical location of the conducted experiment,
and the receiver hardware used for training and testing the neural network

                    <span>Federated learning is a form of distributed learning with the key challenge
being the non-identically distributed nature of the data in the participating
clients. In this paper, we extend federated learning to the setting where
multiple unrelated models are trained simultaneously. Specifically, every
client is able to train any one of M models at a time and the server maintains
a model for each of the M models which is typically a suitably averaged version
of the model computed by the clients. We propose multiple policies for
assigning learning tasks to clients over time. In the first policy, we extend
the widely studied FedAvg to multi-model learning by allotting models to
clients in an i.i.d. stochastic manner. In addition, we propose two new
policies for client selection in a multi-model federated setting which make
decisions based on current local losses for each client-model pair. We compare
the performance of the policies on tasks involving synthetic and real-world
data and characterize the performance of the proposed policies. The key
take-away from our work is that the proposed multi-model policies perform
better or at least as good as single model training using FedAvg.</span>

                    <span>Using only global annotations such as the image class labels,
weakly-supervised learning methods allow CNN classifiers to jointly classify an
image, and yield the regions of interest associated with the predicted class.
However, without any guidance at the pixel level, such methods may yield
inaccurate regions. This problem is known to be more challenging with histology
images than with natural ones, since objects are less salient, structures have
more variations, and foreground and background regions have stronger
similarities. Therefore, methods in computer vision literature for visual
interpretation of CNNs may not directly apply. In this work, we propose a
simple yet efficient method based on a composite loss function that leverages
information from the fully negative samples. Our new loss function contains two
complementary terms: the first exploits positive evidence collected from the
CNN classifier, while the second leverages the fully negative samples from the
training dataset. In particular, we equip a pre-trained classifier with a
decoder that allows refining the regions of interest. The same classifier is
exploited to collect both the positive and negative evidence at the pixel level
to train the decoder. This enables to take advantages of the fully negative
samples that occurs naturally in the data, without any additional supervision
signals and using only the image class as supervision. Compared to several
recent related methods, over the public benchmark GlaS for colon cancer and a
Camelyon16 patch-based benchmark for breast cancer using three different
backbones, we show the substantial improvements introduced by our method. Our
results shows the benefits of using both negative and positive evidence, ie,
the one obtained from a classifier and the one naturally available in datasets.
We provide an ablation study of both terms. Our code is publicly available.</span>

                    <span>We introduce a novel masked graph autoencoder (MGAE) framework to perform
effective learning on graph structure data. Taking insights from
self-supervised learning, we randomly mask a large proportion of edges and try
to reconstruct these missing edges during training. MGAE has two core designs.
First, we find that masking a high ratio of the input graph structure, e.g.,
$70\%$, yields a nontrivial and meaningful self-supervisory task that benefits
downstream applications. Second, we employ a graph neural network (GNN) as an
encoder to perform message propagation on the partially-masked graph. To
reconstruct the large number of masked edges, a tailored cross-correlation
decoder is proposed. It could capture the cross-correlation between the head
and tail nodes of anchor edge in multi-granularity. Coupling these two designs
enables MGAE to be trained efficiently and effectively. Extensive experiments
on multiple open datasets (Planetoid and OGB benchmarks) demonstrate that MGAE
generally performs better than state-of-the-art unsupervised learning
competitors on link prediction and node classification.</span>

Using techniques from mixed-integer optimization, polyhedral theory, and
tropical geometry, we provide a mathematical counterbalance to the universal
approximation theorems which suggest that a single hidden layer is sufficient
for learning tasks. In particular, we investigate whether the class of exactly
representable functions strictly increases by adding more layers (with no
restrictions on size). This problem has potential impact on algorithmic and
statistical aspects because of the insight it provides into the class of
functions represented by neural hypothesis classes. However, to the best of our
knowledge, this question has not been investigated in the neural network
literature. We also present upper bounds on the sizes of neural networks

                    <span>This paper tackles the problem of few-shot learning, which aims to learn new
visual concepts from a few examples. A common problem setting in few-shot
classification assumes random sampling strategy in acquiring data labels, which
is inefficient in practical applications. In this work, we introduce a new
budget-aware few-shot learning problem that not only aims to learn novel object
categories, but also needs to select informative examples to annotate in order
to achieve data efficiency.

We develop a meta-learning strategy for our budget-aware few-shot learning
task, which jointly learns a novel data selection policy based on a Graph
Convolutional Network (GCN) and an example-based few-shot classifier. Our
selection policy computes a context-sensitive representation for each unlabeled
data by graph message passing, which is then used to predict an informativeness
score for sequential selection. We validate our method by extensive experiments
on the mini-ImageNet, tiered-ImageNet and Omniglot datasets. The results show
our few-shot learning strategy outperforms baselines by a sizable margin, which

mixtures with unknown (and possibly degenerate) covariance. Recent works (Ghosh
et al. &#x27;20; Mao, Wein &#x27;21; Davis, Diaz, Wang &#x27;21) have established lower bounds
against the class of low-degree polynomial methods and the sum-of-squares (SoS)
hierarchy for recovering certain hidden structures planted in Gaussian
clustering instances. Prior work on many similar inference tasks portends that
such lower bounds strongly suggest the presence of an inherent
statistical-to-computational gap for clustering, that is, a parameter regime
where the clustering task is statistically possible but no polynomial-time
algorithm succeeds.

One special case of the clustering task we consider is equivalent to the
problem of finding a planted hypercube vector in an otherwise random subspace.
We show that, perhaps surprisingly, this particular clustering model does not
exhibit a statistical-to-computational gap, even though the aforementioned
low-degree and SoS lower bounds continue to apply in this case. To achieve
this, we give a polynomial-time algorithm based on the Lenstra--Lenstra--Lovasz
lattice basis reduction method which achieves the statistically-optimal sample
complexity of d+1 samples. This result extends the class of problems whose
conjectured statistical-to-computational gaps can be &quot;closed&quot; by &quot;brittle&quot;
polynomial-time algorithms, highlighting the crucial but subtle role of noise
in the onset of statistical-to-computational gaps.</span>

                    <span>Many fundamental problems in data mining can be reduced to one or more
NP-hard combinatorial optimization problems. Recent advances in novel
technologies such as quantum and quantum-inspired hardware promise a
substantial speedup for solving these problems compared to when using general
purpose computers but often require the problem to be modeled in a special
form, such as an Ising or quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO)
model, in order to take advantage of these devices. In this work, we focus on
the important binary matrix factorization (BMF) problem which has many
applications in data mining. We propose two QUBO formulations for BMF. We show
how clustering constraints can easily be incorporated into these formulations.
The special purpose hardware we consider is limited in the number of variables
it can handle which presents a challenge when factorizing large matrices. We
propose a sampling based approach to overcome this challenge, allowing us to
factorize large rectangular matrices. In addition to these methods, we also
propose a simple baseline algorithm which outperforms our more sophisticated
methods in a few situations. We run experiments on the Fujitsu Digital
Annealer, a quantum-inspired complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS)
annealer, on both synthetic and real data, including gene expression data.
These experiments show that our approach is able to produce more accurate BMFs
than competing methods.</span>

                    <span>The similarity between objects is significant in a broad range of areas.
While similarity can be measured using off-the-shelf distance functions, they
may fail to capture the inherent meaning of similarity, which tends to depend
on the underlying data and task. Moreover, conventional distance functions
limit the space of similarity measures to be symmetric and do not directly
allow comparing objects from different spaces. We propose using quantum
networks (GQSim) for learning task-dependent (a)symmetric similarity between
data that need not have the same dimensionality. We analyze the properties of
such similarity function analytically (for a simple case) and numerically (for
a complex case) and showthat these similarity measures can extract salient
features of the data. We also demonstrate that the similarity measure derived
using this technique is $(\epsilon,\gamma,\tau)$-good, resulting in
theoretically guaranteed performance. Finally, we conclude by applying this
technique for three relevant applications - Classification, Graph Completion,
Generative modeling.</span>

in data sets which deviate from the norm significantly. In this study, we
propose a signatures based machine learning algorithm to detect rare or
unexpected items in a given data set of time series type. We present
applications of signature or randomized signature as feature extractors for
anomaly detection algorithms; additionally we provide an easy, representation
theoretic justification for the construction of randomized signatures. Our
first application is based on synthetic data and aims at distinguishing between
real and fake trajectories of stock prices, which are indistinguishable by
visual inspection. We also show a real life application by using transaction
data from the cryptocurrency market. In this case, we are able to identify pump
and dump attempts organized on social networks with F1 scores up to 88% by
means of our unsupervised learning algorithm, thus achieving results that are
close to the state-of-the-art in the field based on supervised learning.</span>

                    <span>Markov chains with variable length are useful parsimonious stochastic models
able to generate most stationary sequence of discrete symbols. The idea is to
identify the suffixes of the past, called contexts, that are relevant to
predict the future symbol. Sometimes a single state is a context, and looking
at the past and finding this specific state makes the further past irrelevant.
States with such property are called renewal states and they can be used to
split the chain into independent and identically distributed blocks. In order
to identify renewal states for chains with variable length, we propose the use
of Intrinsic Bayes Factor to evaluate the hypothesis that some particular state
is a renewal state. In this case, the difficulty lies in integrating the
marginal posterior distribution for the random context trees for general prior
distribution on the space of context trees, with Dirichlet prior for the
transition probabilities, and Monte Carlo methods are applied. To show the
strength of our method, we analyzed artificial datasets generated from
different binary models models and one example coming from the field of
Linguistics.</span>

                    <span>State-of-the-art stereo matching networks trained only on synthetic data
often fail to generalize to more challenging real data domains. In this paper,
we attempt to unfold an important factor that hinders the networks from
generalizing across domains: through the lens of shortcut learning. We
demonstrate that the learning of feature representations in stereo matching
networks is heavily influenced by synthetic data artefacts (shortcut
attributes). To mitigate this issue, we propose an Information-Theoretic
Shortcut Avoidance~(ITSA) approach to automatically restrict shortcut-related
information from being encoded into the feature representations. As a result,
our proposed method learns robust and shortcut-invariant features by minimizing
the sensitivity of latent features to input variations. To avoid the
prohibitive computational cost of direct input sensitivity optimization, we
propose an effective yet feasible algorithm to achieve robustness. We show that
using this method, state-of-the-art stereo matching networks that are trained
purely on synthetic data can effectively generalize to challenging and
previously unseen real data scenarios. Importantly, the proposed method
enhances the robustness of the synthetic trained networks to the point that
they outperform their fine-tuned counterparts (on real data) for challenging
out-of-domain stereo datasets.</span>

                    <span>We develop the &quot;generalized consistent weighted sampling&quot; (GCWS) for hashing
the &quot;powered-GMM&quot; (pGMM) kernel (with a tuning parameter $p$). It turns out
that GCWS provides a numerically stable scheme for applying power
transformation on the original data, regardless of the magnitude of $p$ and the
data. The power transformation is often effective for boosting the performance,
in many cases considerably so. We feed the hashed data to neural networks on a
variety of public classification datasets and name our method &#x60;&#x60;GCWSNet&#x27;&#x27;. Our
extensive experiments show that GCWSNet often improves the classification
accuracy. Furthermore, it is evident from the experiments that GCWSNet
converges substantially faster. In fact, GCWS often reaches a reasonable
accuracy with merely (less than) one epoch of the training process. This
property is much desired because many applications, such as advertisement
click-through rate (CTR) prediction models, or data streams (i.e., data seen
only once), often train just one epoch. Another beneficial side effect is that
the computations of the first layer of the neural networks become additions
instead of multiplications because the input data become binary (and highly
sparse).

Empirical comparisons with (normalized) random Fourier features (NRFF) are
provided. We also propose to reduce the model size of GCWSNet by count-sketch
and develop the theory for analyzing the impact of using count-sketch on the
accuracy of GCWS. Our analysis shows that an &#x60;&#x60;8-bit&#x27;&#x27; strategy should work
well in that we can always apply an 8-bit count-sketch hashing on the output of
GCWS hashing without hurting the accuracy much. There are many other ways to
take advantage of GCWS when training deep neural networks. For example, one can
apply GCWS on the outputs of the last layer to boost the accuracy of trained
deep neural networks.</span>

                    <span>Sparse PCA is the optimization problem obtained from PCA by adding a sparsity
constraint on the principal components. Sparse PCA is NP-hard and hard to
approximate even in the single-component case. In this paper we settle the
computational complexity of sparse PCA with respect to the rank of the
covariance matrix. We show that, if the rank of the covariance matrix is a
fixed value, then there is an algorithm that solves sparse PCA to global
optimality, whose running time is polynomial in the number of features. We also
prove a similar result for the version of sparse PCA which requires the
principal components to have disjoint supports.</span>

                    <span>An important problem in causal inference is to break down the total effect of
a treatment on an outcome into different causal pathways and to quantify the
causal effect in each pathway. For instance, in causal fairness, the total
effect of being a male employee (i.e., treatment) constitutes its direct effect
on annual income (i.e., outcome) and the indirect effect via the employee&#x27;s
occupation (i.e., mediator). Causal mediation analysis (CMA) is a formal
statistical framework commonly used to reveal such underlying causal
mechanisms. One major challenge of CMA in observational studies is handling
confounders, variables that cause spurious causal relationships among
treatment, mediator, and outcome. Conventional methods assume sequential
ignorability that implies all confounders can be measured, which is often
unverifiable in practice. This work aims to circumvent the stringent sequential
ignorability assumptions and consider hidden confounders. Drawing upon proxy
strategies and recent advances in deep learning, we propose to simultaneously
uncover the latent variables that characterize hidden confounders and estimate
the causal effects. Empirical evaluations using both synthetic and
semi-synthetic datasets validate the effectiveness of the proposed method. We
further show the potentials of our approach for causal fairness analysis.</span>

                    <span>The similarity of feature representations plays a pivotal role in the success
of problems related to domain adaptation. Feature similarity includes both the
invariance of marginal distributions and the closeness of conditional
distributions given the desired response $y$ (e.g., class labels).
Unfortunately, traditional methods always learn such features without fully
taking into consideration the information in $y$, which in turn may lead to a
mismatch of the conditional distributions or the mix-up of discriminative
structures underlying data distributions. In this work, we introduce the
recently proposed von Neumann conditional divergence to improve the
transferability across multiple domains. We show that this new divergence is
differentiable and eligible to easily quantify the functional dependence
between features and $y$. Given multiple source tasks, we integrate this
divergence to capture discriminative information in $y$ and design novel
learning objectives assuming those source tasks are observed either
simultaneously or sequentially. In both scenarios, we obtain favorable
performance against state-of-the-art methods in terms of smaller generalization
error on new tasks and less catastrophic forgetting on source tasks (in the
sequential setup).</span>

Cognitive Maps (FCM) have shown remarkable results as a tool to model and
analyze the dynamics of complex systems. FCM have similarities to recurrent
neural networks and can be classified as a neuro-fuzzy method. In other words,
FCMs are a mixture of fuzzy logic, neural network, and expert system aspects,
which act as a powerful tool for simulating and studying the dynamic behavior
of complex systems. The most interesting features are knowledge
interpretability, dynamic characteristics and learning capability. The goal of
this survey paper is mainly to present an overview on the most relevant and

addition, this article considers an introduction on the fundamentals of FCM
model and learning methodologies. Also, this survey provides some ideas for

                    <span>Adversarial bit-flip attack (BFA) on Neural Network weights can result in
catastrophic accuracy degradation by flipping a very small number of bits. A
major drawback of prior bit flip attack techniques is their reliance on test
data. This is frequently not possible for applications that contain sensitive
or proprietary data. In this paper, we propose Blind Data Adversarial Bit-flip
Attack (BDFA), a novel technique to enable BFA without any access to the
training or testing data. This is achieved by optimizing for a synthetic
dataset, which is engineered to match the statistics of batch normalization
across different layers of the network and the targeted label. Experimental
results show that BDFA could decrease the accuracy of ResNet50 significantly

                    <span>Recent advances in deep learning have led to a paradigm shift in reversible
steganography. A fundamental pillar of reversible steganography is predictive
modelling which can be realised via deep neural networks. However, non-trivial
errors exist in inferences about some out-of-distribution and noisy data. In
view of this issue, we propose to consider uncertainty in predictive models
based upon a theoretical framework of Bayesian deep learning. Bayesian neural
networks can be regarded as self-aware machinery; that is, a machine that knows
its own limitations. To quantify uncertainty, we approximate the posterior
predictive distribution through Monte Carlo sampling with stochastic forward
passes. We further show that predictive uncertainty can be disentangled into
aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties and these quantities can be learnt in an
unsupervised manner. Experimental results demonstrate an improvement delivered
by Bayesian uncertainty analysis upon steganographic capacity-distortion
performance.</span>

approach, machine learning or statistical modeling, to solve an analytics
challenge. However, machine learning and statistical modeling are more cousins
than adversaries on different sides of an analysis battleground. Choosing
between the two approaches or in some cases using both is based on the problem
to be solved and outcomes required as well as the data available for use and
circumstances of the analysis. Machine learning and statistical modeling are
complementary, based on similar mathematical principles, but simply using
different tools in an overall analytics knowledge base. Determining the
predominant approach should be based on the problem to be solved as well as
empirical evidence, such as size and completeness of the data, number of
variables, assumptions or lack thereof, and expected outcomes such as
predictions or causality. Good analysts and data scientists should be well

renewable electricity generation from sources such as photovoltaics (PV) and
wind as well as load demands has recently gained attention. Normalizing flow
density models are particularly well suited for this task due to the training
through direct log-likelihood maximization. However, research from the field of
image generation has shown that standard normalizing flows can only learn
smeared-out versions of manifold distributions. Previous works on normalizing
flow-based scenario generation do not address this issue, and the smeared-out
distributions result in the sampling of noisy time series. In this paper, we
exploit the isometry of the principal component analysis (PCA), which sets up
the normalizing flow in a lower-dimensional space while maintaining the direct
and computationally efficient likelihood maximization. We train the resulting
principal component flow (PCF) on data of PV and wind power generation as well
as load demand in Germany in the years 2013 to 2015. The results of this
investigation show that the PCF preserves critical features of the original
distributions, such as the probability density and frequency behavior of the
time series. The application of the PCF is, however, not limited to renewable
power generation but rather extends to any data set, time series, or otherwise,
which can be efficiently reduced using PCA.</span>

                    <span>We study the problem of matrix completion in this paper. A spectral scaled
Student prior is exploited to favour the underlying low-rank structure of the
data matrix. We provide a thorough theoretical investigation for our approach
through PAC-Bayesian bounds. More precisely, our PAC-Bayesian approach enjoys a
minimax-optimal oracle inequality which guarantees that our method works well
under model misspecification and under general sampling distribution.
Interestingly, we also provide efficient gradient-based sampling
implementations for our approach by using Langevin Monte Carlo. More
specifically, we show that our algorithms are significantly faster than Gibbs
sampler in this problem. To illustrate the attractive features of our inference
strategy, some numerical simulations are conducted and an application to image
inpainting is demonstrated.</span>

                    <span>Visual localization tackles the challenge of estimating the camera pose from
images by using correspondence analysis between query images and a map. This
task is computation and data intensive which poses challenges on thorough
evaluation of methods on various datasets. However, in order to further advance
in the field, we claim that robust visual localization algorithms should be
evaluated on multiple datasets covering a broad domain variety. To facilitate
this, we introduce kapture, a new, flexible, unified data format and toolbox
for visual localization and structure-from-motion (SFM). It enables easy usage
of different datasets as well as efficient and reusable data processing. To
demonstrate this, we present a versatile pipeline for visual localization that
facilitates the use of different local and global features, 3D data (e.g. depth
maps), non-vision sensor data (e.g. IMU, GPS, WiFi), and various processing
algorithms. Using multiple configurations of the pipeline, we show the great
versatility of kapture in our experiments. Furthermore, we evaluate our methods
on eight public datasets where they rank top on all and first on many of them.
To foster future research, we release code, models, and all datasets used in
this paper in the kapture format open source under a permissive BSD license.

                    <span>Advances in the motor imagery (MI)-based brain-computer interfaces (BCIs)
allow control of several applications by decoding neurophysiological phenomena,
which are usually recorded by electroencephalography (EEG) using a non-invasive
technique. Despite great advances in MI-based BCI, EEG rhythms are specific to
a subject and various changes over time. These issues point to significant
challenges to enhance the classification performance, especially in a
subject-independent manner. To overcome these challenges, we propose MIN2Net, a
novel end-to-end multi-task learning to tackle this task. We integrate deep
metric learning into a multi-task autoencoder to learn a compact and
discriminative latent representation from EEG and perform classification
simultaneously. This approach reduces the complexity in pre-processing, results
in significant performance improvement on EEG classification. Experimental
results in a subject-independent manner show that MIN2Net outperforms the
state-of-the-art techniques, achieving an F1-score improvement of 6.72%, and
2.23% on the SMR-BCI, and OpenBMI datasets, respectively. We demonstrate that
MIN2Net improves discriminative information in the latent representation. This
study indicates the possibility and practicality of using this model to develop
MI-based BCI applications for new users without the need for calibration.</span>

                    <span>Federated learning trains models across devices with distributed data, while
protecting the privacy and obtaining a model similar to that of centralized ML.
A large number of workers with data and computing power are the foundation of
federal learning. However, the inevitable costs prevent self-interested workers
from serving for free. Moreover, due to data isolation, task publishers lack
effective methods to select, evaluate and pay reliable workers with
high-quality data. Therefore, we design an auction-based incentive mechanism
for horizontal federated learning with reputation and contribution measurement.
By designing a reasonable method of measuring contribution, we establish the
reputation of workers, which is easy to decline and difficult to improve.
Through reverse auctions, workers bid for tasks, and the task publisher selects
workers combining reputation and bid price. With the budget constraint, winning
workers are paid based on performance. We proved that our mechanism satisfies
the individual rationality of the honest worker, budget feasibility,
truthfulness, and computational efficiency.</span>

                    <span>Representation learning from unlabeled data has been of major interest in
artificial intelligence research. While self-supervised speech representation
learning has been popular in the speech research community, very few works have
comprehensively analyzed audio representation learning for non-speech audio
tasks. In this paper, we propose a self-supervised audio representation
learning method and apply it to a variety of downstream non-speech audio tasks.
We combine the well-known wav2vec 2.0 framework, which has shown success in
self-supervised learning for speech tasks, with parameter-efficient conformer
architectures. Our self-supervised pre-training can reduce the need for labeled
data by two-thirds. On the AudioSet benchmark, we achieve a mean average
precision (mAP) score of 0.415, which is a new state-of-the-art on this dataset
through audio-only self-supervised learning. Our fine-tuned conformers also
surpass or match the performance of previous systems pre-trained in a
supervised way on several downstream tasks. We further discuss the important
design considerations for both pre-training and fine-tuning.</span>

                    <span>Reward design is a fundamental problem in reinforcement learning (RL). A
misspecified or poorly designed reward can result in low sample efficiency and
undesired behaviors. In this paper, we propose the idea of programmatic reward
design, i.e. using programs to specify the reward functions in RL environments.
Programs allow human engineers to express sub-goals and complex task scenarios
in a structured and interpretable way. The challenge of programmatic reward
design, however, is that while humans can provide the high-level structures,
properly setting the low-level details, such as the right amount of reward for
a specific sub-task, remains difficult. A major contribution of this paper is a
probabilistic framework that can infer the best candidate programmatic reward
function from expert demonstrations. Inspired by recent generative-adversarial
approaches, our framework searches for the most likely programmatic reward
function under which the optimally generated trajectories cannot be
differentiated from the demonstrated trajectories. Experimental results show
that programmatic reward functionslearned using this framework can
significantly outperform those learned using existing reward learning
algo-rithms, and enable RL agents to achieve state-of-the-artperformance on
highly complex tasks.</span>

                    <span>Traffic signal control is an important problem in urban mobility with a
significant potential of economic and environmental impact. While there is a
growing interest in Reinforcement Learning (RL) for traffic control, the work
so far has focussed on learning through interactions which, in practice, is
costly. Instead, real experience data on traffic is available and could be
exploited at minimal costs. Recent progress in offline or batch RL has enabled
just that. Model-based offline RL methods, in particular, have been shown to
generalize to the experience data much better than others. We build a
model-based learning framework, A-DAC, which infers a Markov Decision Process
(MDP) from dataset with pessimistic costs built in to deal with data
uncertainties. The costs are modeled through an adaptive shaping of rewards in
the MDP which provides better regularization of data compared to the prior
related work. A-DAC is evaluated on a complex signalized roundabout using
multiple datasets varying in size and in batch collection policy. The
evaluation results show that it is possible to build high performance control
policies in a data efficient manner using simplistic batch collection policies.</span>

                    <span>The El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) is a semi-periodic fluctuation in sea
surface temperature (SST) over the tropical central and eastern Pacific Ocean
that influences interannual variability in regional hydrology across the world
through long-range dependence or teleconnections. Recent research has
demonstrated the value of Deep Learning (DL) methods for improving ENSO
prediction as well as Complex Networks (CN) for understanding teleconnections.
However, gaps in predictive understanding of ENSO-driven river flows include
the black box nature of DL, the use of simple ENSO indices to describe a
complex phenomenon and translating DL-based ENSO predictions to river flow
predictions. Here we show that eXplainable DL (XDL) methods, based on saliency
maps, can extract interpretable predictive information contained in global SST
and discover novel SST information regions and dependence structures relevant
for river flows which, in tandem with climate network constructions, enable
improved predictive understanding. Our results reveal additional information
content in global SST beyond ENSO indices, develop new understanding of how
SSTs influence river flows, and generate improved river flow predictions with
uncertainties. Observations, reanalysis data, and earth system model
simulations are used to demonstrate the value of the XDL-CN based methods for
future interannual and decadal scale climate projections.</span>

                    <span>In business retention, churn prevention has always been a major concern. This
work contributes to this domain by formalizing the problem of churn prediction
in the context of online gambling as a binary classification task. We also
propose an algorithmic answer to this problem based on recurrent neural
network. This algorithm is tested with online gambling data that have the form
of time series, which can be efficiently processed by recurrent neural
networks. To evaluate the performances of the trained models, standard machine
learning metrics were used, such as accuracy, precision and recall. For this
problem in particular, the conducted experiments allowed to assess that the
choice of a specific architecture depends on the metric which is given the
greatest importance. Architectures using nBRC favour precision, those using
LSTM give better recall, while GRU-based architectures allow a higher accuracy
and balance two other metrics. Moreover, further experiments showed that using
only the more recent time-series histories to train the networks decreases the
quality of the results. We also study the performances of models learned at a
specific instant $t$, at other times $t^{\prime} &gt; t$. The results show that
the performances of the models learned at time $t$ remain good at the following
instants $t^{\prime} &gt; t$, suggesting that there is no need to refresh the
models at a high rate. However, the performances of the models were subject to
noticeable variance due to one-off events impacting the data.</span>

                    <span>Machine learning methods such as deep neural networks (DNNs), despite their
success across different domains, are known to often generate incorrect
predictions with high confidence on inputs outside their training distribution.
The deployment of DNNs in safety-critical domains requires detection of
out-of-distribution (OOD) data so that DNNs can abstain from making predictions
on those. A number of methods have been recently developed for OOD detection,
but there is still room for improvement. We propose the new method iDECODe,
leveraging in-distribution equivariance for conformal OOD detection. It relies
on a novel base non-conformity measure and a new aggregation method, used in
the inductive conformal anomaly detection framework, thereby guaranteeing a
bounded false detection rate. We demonstrate the efficacy of iDECODe by
experiments on image and audio datasets, obtaining state-of-the-art results. We
also show that iDECODe can detect adversarial examples.</span>

                    <span>We introduce a new general-purpose approach to deep learning on 3D surfaces,
based on the insight that a simple diffusion layer is highly effective for
spatial communication. The resulting networks are automatically robust to
changes in resolution and sampling of a surface -- a basic property which is
crucial for practical applications. Our networks can be discretized on various
geometric representations such as triangle meshes or point clouds, and can even
be trained on one representation then applied to another. We optimize the
spatial support of diffusion as a continuous network parameter ranging from
purely local to totally global, removing the burden of manually choosing
neighborhood sizes. The only other ingredients in the method are a multi-layer
perceptron applied independently at each point, and spatial gradient features
to support directional filters. The resulting networks are simple, robust, and
efficient. Here, we focus primarily on triangle mesh surfaces, and demonstrate
state-of-the-art results for a variety of tasks including surface
classification, segmentation, and non-rigid correspondence.</span>

                    <span>Federated learning (FL) is an emerging privacy-preserving distributed
learning scheme. Due to the large model size and frequent model aggregation, FL
suffers from critical communication bottleneck. Many techniques have been
proposed to reduce the communication volume, including model compression and
quantization. Existing adaptive quantization schemes use ascending-trend
quantization where the quantizaion level increases with the training stages. In
this paper, we formulate the problem as optimizing the training convergence
rate for a given communication volume. The result shows that the optimal
quantizaiton level can be represented by two factors, i.e., the training loss
and the range of model updates, and it is preferable to decrease the
quantization level rather than increase. Then, we propose two descending
quantization schemes based on the training loss and model range. Experimental
results show that proposed schemes not only reduce the communication volume but
also help FL converge faster, when compared with current ascending

                    <span>Humans race drones faster than neural networks trained for end-to-end
autonomous flight. This may be related to the ability of human pilots to select
task-relevant visual information effectively. This work investigates whether
neural networks capable of imitating human eye gaze behavior and attention can
improve neural network performance for the challenging task of vision-based
autonomous drone racing. We hypothesize that gaze-based attention prediction
can be an efficient mechanism for visual information selection and decision
making in a simulator-based drone racing task. We test this hypothesis using
eye gaze and flight trajectory data from 18 human drone pilots to train a
visual attention prediction model. We then use this visual attention prediction
model to train an end-to-end controller for vision-based autonomous drone
racing using imitation learning. We compare the drone racing performance of the
attention-prediction controller to those using raw image inputs and image-based
abstractions (i.e., feature tracks). Our results show that attention-prediction
based controllers outperform the baselines and are able to complete a
challenging race track consistently with up to 88% success rate. Furthermore,
visual attention-prediction and feature-track based models showed better
generalization performance than image-based models when evaluated on hold-out
reference trajectories. Our results demonstrate that human visual attention
prediction improves the performance of autonomous vision-based drone racing
agents and provides an essential step towards vision-based, fast, and agile
autonomous flight that eventually can reach and even exceed human performances.</span>

                    <span>Motivation: Protein-protein interactions (PPI) are critical to the function
of proteins in both normal and diseased cells, and many critical protein
functions are mediated by interactions.Knowledge of the nature of these
interactions is important for the construction of networks to analyse
biological data. However, only a small percentage of PPIs captured in protein
interaction databases have annotations of function available, e.g. only 4% of
PPI are functionally annotated in the IntAct database. Here, we aim to label
the function type of PPIs by extracting relationships described in PubMed
abstracts.

Method: We create a weakly supervised dataset from the IntAct PPI database
containing interacting protein pairs with annotated function and associated
abstracts from the PubMed database. We apply a state-of-the-art deep learning
technique for biomedical natural language processing tasks, BioBERT, to build a
model - dubbed PPI-BioBERT - for identifying the function of PPIs. In order to
extract high quality PPI functions at large scale, we use an ensemble of
PPI-BioBERT models to improve uncertainty estimation and apply an interaction
type-specific threshold to counteract the effects of variations in the number
of training samples per interaction type.

Results: We scan 18 million PubMed abstracts to automatically identify 3253
new typed PPIs, including phosphorylation and acetylation interactions, with an
overall precision of 46% (87% for acetylation) based on a human-reviewed
sample. This work demonstrates that analysis of biomedical abstracts for PPI
function extraction is a feasible approach to substantially increasing the
number of interactions annotated with function captured in online databases.</span>

networks for reinforcement learning (RL) tasks. This method combines two ideas:
neural network pruning and taking into account input data correlations; it
makes it possible to update neuron states only when changes in them exceed a
certain threshold. It significantly reduces the number of multiplications when
running neural networks. We tested different RL tasks and achieved 20-150x
reduction in the number of multiplications. There were no substantial
performance losses; sometimes the performance even improved.</span>

                    <span>Session-based recommendation systems suggest relevant items to users by
modeling user behavior and preferences using short-term anonymous sessions.
Existing methods leverage Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) that propagate and
aggregate information from neighboring nodes i.e., local message passing. Such
graph-based architectures have representational limits, as a single sub-graph
is susceptible to overfit the sequential dependencies instead of accounting for
complex transitions between items in different sessions. We propose a new
technique that leverages a Transformer in combination with a target attentive
GNN. This allows richer representations to be learnt, which translates to
empirical performance gains in comparison to a vanilla target attentive GNN.
Our experimental results and ablation show that our proposed method is
competitive with the existing methods on real-world benchmark datasets,
improving on graph-based hypotheses. Code is available at

private and non-private settings, showing that the data dimensionality
dependent term introduced by private optimization compounds the difficulties of
learning a robust model. After this, we discuss what parts of adversarial
training and differential privacy hurt optimization, identifying that the size
of adversarial perturbation and clipping norm in differential privacy both
increase the curvature of the loss landscape, implying poorer generalization
performance.</span>

                    <span>Multimodal Language Analysis is a demanding area of research, since it is
associated with two requirements: combining different modalities and capturing
temporal information. During the last years, several works have been proposed
in the area, mostly centered around supervised learning in downstream tasks. In
this paper we propose extracting unsupervised Multimodal Language
representations that are universal and can be applied to different tasks.
Towards this end, we map the word-level aligned multimodal sequences to 2-D
matrices and then use Convolutional Autoencoders to learn embeddings by
combining multiple datasets. Extensive experimentation on Sentiment Analysis
(MOSEI) and Emotion Recognition (IEMOCAP) indicate that the learned
representations can achieve near-state-of-the-art performance with just the use
of a Logistic Regression algorithm for downstream classification. It is also
shown that our method is extremely lightweight and can be easily generalized to
other tasks and unseen data with small performance drop and almost the same
number of parameters. The proposed multimodal representation models are
open-sourced and will help grow the applicability of Multimodal Language.</span>

spoken, such as recognizing emotion, detecting whether the speaker is wearing a
mask, or distinguishing real from synthetic speech. In this work, we introduce
a new state-of-the-art paralinguistic representation derived from large-scale,
fully self-supervised training of a 600M+ parameter Conformer-based
architecture. We benchmark on a diverse set of speech tasks and demonstrate
that simple linear classifiers trained on top of our time-averaged
representation outperform nearly all previous results, in some cases by large
margins. Our analyses of context-window size demonstrate that, surprisingly, 2
second context-windows achieve 96\% the performance of the Conformers that use
the full long-term context on 7 out of 9 tasks. Furthermore, while the best
per-task representations are extracted internally in the network, stable
performance across several layers allows a single universal representation to
reach near optimal performance on all tasks.</span>

                    <span>General policy improvement (GPI) and trust-region learning (TRL) are the
predominant frameworks within contemporary reinforcement learning (RL), which
serve as the core models for solving Markov decision processes (MDPs).
Unfortunately, in their mathematical form, they are sensitive to modifications,
and thus, the practical instantiations that implement them do not automatically
inherit their improvement guarantees. As a result, the spectrum of available
rigorous MDP-solvers is narrow. Indeed, many state-of-the-art (SOTA)
algorithms, such as TRPO and PPO, are not proven to converge. In this paper, we
propose \textsl{mirror learning} -- a general solution to the RL problem. We
reveal GPI and TRL to be but small points within this far greater space of
algorithms which boasts the monotonic improvement property and converges to the
optimal policy. We show that virtually all SOTA algorithms for RL are instances
of mirror learning, and thus suggest that their empirical performance is a
consequence of their theoretical properties, rather than of approximate
analogies. Excitingly, we show that mirror learning opens up a whole new space
of policy learning methods with convergence guarantees.</span>

                    <span>In time series data analysis, detecting change points on a real-time basis
(online) is of great interest in many areas, such as finance, environmental
monitoring, and medicine. One promising means to achieve this is the Bayesian
online change point detection (BOCPD) algorithm, which has been successfully
adopted in particular cases in which the time series of interest has a fixed
baseline. However, we have found that the algorithm struggles when the baseline
irreversibly shifts from its initial state. This is because with the original
BOCPD algorithm, the sensitivity with which a change point can be detected is
degraded if the data points are fluctuating at locations relatively far from
the original baseline. In this paper, we not only extend the original BOCPD
algorithm to be applicable to a time series whose baseline is constantly
shifting toward unknown values but also visualize why the proposed extension
works. To demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed algorithm compared to the
original one, we examine these algorithms on two real-world data sets and six
synthetic data sets.</span>

helps the mixup algorithm correctly label mixup samples by learning the

                    <span>Intracranial aneurysms are common nowadays and how to detect them
intelligently is of great significance in digital health. While most existing
deep learning research focused on medical images in a supervised way, we
introduce an unsupervised method for the detection of intracranial aneurysms
based on 3D point cloud data. In particular, our method consists of two stages:
unsupervised pre-training and downstream tasks. As for the former, the main
idea is to pair each point cloud with its jittered counterpart and maximise
their correspondence. Then we design a dual-branch contrastive network with an
encoder for each branch and a subsequent common projection head. As for the
latter, we design simple networks for supervised classification and
segmentation training. Experiments on the public dataset (IntrA) show that our
unsupervised method achieves comparable or even better performance than some
state-of-the-art supervised techniques, and it is most prominent in the
detection of aneurysmal vessels. Experiments on the ModelNet40 also show that
our method achieves the accuracy of 90.79\% which outperforms existing
state-of-the-art unsupervised models.</span>

                    <span>Metric $k$-center clustering is a fundamental unsupervised learning
primitive. Although widely used, this primitive is heavily affected by noise in
the data, so that a more sensible variant seeks for the best solution that
disregards a given number $z$ of points of the dataset, called outliers. We
provide efficient algorithms for this important variant in the streaming model
under the sliding window setting, where, at each time step, the dataset to be
clustered is the window $W$ of the most recent data items. Our algorithms
achieve $O(1)$ approximation and, remarkably, require a working memory linear
in $k+z$ and only logarithmic in $|W|$. As a by-product, we show how to
estimate the effective diameter of the window $W$, which is a measure of the
spread of the window points, disregarding a given fraction of noisy distances.
We also provide experimental evidence of the practical viability of our

to train due to extremely large sequence length of audio waveforms or incur a
performance penalty when trained on Fourier-based features. In this work, we
introduce an architecture, Audiomer, where we combine 1D Residual Networks with
Performer Attention to achieve state-of-the-art performance in keyword spotting
with raw audio waveforms, outperforming all previous methods while being
computationally cheaper and parameter-efficient. Additionally, our model has
practical advantages for speech processing, such as inference on arbitrarily

                    <span>Crime prediction is crucial for public safety and resource optimization, yet
is very challenging due to two aspects: i) the dynamics of criminal patterns
across time and space, crime events are distributed unevenly on both spatial
and temporal domains; ii) time-evolving dependencies between different types of
crimes (e.g., Theft, Robbery, Assault, Damage) which reveal fine-grained
semantics of crimes. To tackle these challenges, we propose Spatial-Temporal
Sequential Hypergraph Network (ST-SHN) to collectively encode complex crime
spatial-temporal patterns as well as the underlying category-wise crime
semantic relationships. In specific, to handle spatial-temporal dynamics under
the long-range and global context, we design a graph-structured message passing
architecture with the integration of the hypergraph learning paradigm. To
capture category-wise crime heterogeneous relations in a dynamic environment,
we introduce a multi-channel routing mechanism to learn the time-evolving
structural dependency across crime types. We conduct extensive experiments on
two real-world datasets, showing that our proposed ST-SHN framework can
significantly improve the prediction performance as compared to various
state-of-the-art baselines. The source code is available at:

there have been limited studies on the adversarial robustness of multi-modal
models that fuse LiDAR features with image features. Furthermore, existing
works do not consider physically realizable perturbations that are consistent
across the input modalities. In this paper, we showcase practical
susceptibilities of multi-sensor detection by placing an adversarial object on
top of a host vehicle. We focus on physically realizable and input-agnostic
attacks as they are feasible to execute in practice, and show that a single
universal adversary can hide different host vehicles from state-of-the-art
multi-modal detectors. Our experiments demonstrate that successful attacks are
primarily caused by easily corrupted image features. Furthermore, we find that
in modern sensor fusion methods which project image features into 3D,
adversarial attacks can exploit the projection process to generate false
positives across distant regions in 3D. Towards more robust multi-modal
perception systems, we show that adversarial training with feature denoising
can boost robustness to such attacks significantly. However, we find that
standard adversarial defenses still struggle to prevent false positives which
are also caused by inaccurate associations between 3D LiDAR points and 2D
pixels.</span>

                    <span>Protein-protein interactions (PPIs) are critical to normal cellular function
and are related to many disease pathways. However, only 4% of PPIs are
annotated with PTMs in biological knowledge databases such as IntAct, mainly
performed through manual curation, which is neither time nor cost-effective. We
use the IntAct PPI database to create a distant supervised dataset annotated
with interacting protein pairs, their corresponding PTM type, and associated
abstracts from the PubMed database. We train an ensemble of BioBERT models -
dubbed PPI-BioBERT-x10 to improve confidence calibration. We extend the use of
ensemble average confidence approach with confidence variation to counteract
the effects of class imbalance to extract high confidence predictions. The
PPI-BioBERT-x10 model evaluated on the test set resulted in a modest F1-micro
41.3 (P &#x3D;5 8.1, R &#x3D; 32.1). However, by combining high confidence and low
variation to identify high quality predictions, tuning the predictions for
precision, we retained 19% of the test predictions with 100% precision. We
evaluated PPI-BioBERT-x10 on 18 million PubMed abstracts and extracted 1.6
million (546507 unique PTM-PPI triplets) PTM-PPI predictions, and filter ~ 5700
(4584 unique) high confidence predictions. Of the 5700, human evaluation on a
small randomly sampled subset shows that the precision drops to 33.7% despite
confidence calibration and highlights the challenges of generalisability beyond
the test set even with confidence calibration. We circumvent the problem by
only including predictions associated with multiple papers, improving the
precision to 58.8%. In this work, we highlight the benefits and challenges of
deep learning-based text mining in practice, and the need for increased
emphasis on confidence calibration to facilitate human curation efforts.</span>

                    <span>Recent work learns contextual representations of source code by
reconstructing tokens from their context. For downstream semantic understanding
tasks like summarizing code in English, these representations should ideally
capture program functionality. However, we show that the popular
reconstruction-based BERT model is sensitive to source code edits, even when
the edits preserve semantics. We propose ContraCode: a contrastive pre-training
task that learns code functionality, not form. ContraCode pre-trains a neural
network to identify functionally similar variants of a program among many
non-equivalent distractors. We scalably generate these variants using an
automated source-to-source compiler as a form of data augmentation. Contrastive
pre-training improves JavaScript summarization and TypeScript type inference
accuracy by 2% to 13%. We also propose a new zero-shot JavaScript code clone
detection dataset, showing that ContraCode is both more robust and semantically
meaningful. On it, we outperform RoBERTa by 39% AUROC in an adversarial setting
and up to 5% on natural code.</span>

                    <span>This paper focuses on stochastic saddle point problems with
decision-dependent distributions in both the static and time-varying settings.
These are problems whose objective is the expected value of a stochastic payoff
function, where random variables are drawn from a distribution induced by a
distributional map. For general distributional maps, the problem of finding
saddle points is in general computationally burdensome, even if the
distribution is known. To enable a tractable solution approach, we introduce
the notion of equilibrium points -- which are saddle points for the stationary
stochastic minimax problem that they induce -- and provide conditions for their
existence and uniqueness. We demonstrate that the distance between the two
classes of solutions is bounded provided that the objective has a
strongly-convex-strongly-concave payoff and Lipschitz continuous distributional
map. We develop deterministic and stochastic primal-dual algorithms and
demonstrate their convergence to the equilibrium point. In particular, by
modeling errors emerging from a stochastic gradient estimator as sub-Weibull
random variables, we provide error bounds in expectation and in high
probability that hold for each iteration; moreover, we show convergence to a
neighborhood in expectation and almost surely. Finally, we investigate a
condition on the distributional map -- which we call opposing mixture dominance
-- that ensures the objective is strongly-convex-strongly-concave. Under this
assumption, we show that primal-dual algorithms converge to the saddle points
in a similar fashion.</span>

                    <span>We are concerned with the problem of hyperparameter selection of offline
policy evaluation (OPE). OPE is a key component of offline reinforcement
learning, which is a core technology for data-driven decision optimization
without environment simulators. However, the current state-of-the-art OPE
methods are not hyperparameter-free, which undermines their utility in
real-life applications. We address this issue by introducing a new approximate
hyperparameter selection (AHS) framework for OPE, which defines a notion of
optimality (called selection criteria) in a quantitative and interpretable
manner without hyperparameters. We then derive four AHS methods each of which
has different characteristics such as convergence rate and time complexity.
Finally, we verify effectiveness and limitation of these methods with a
preliminary experiment.</span>

                    <span>Neural operators have recently become popular tools for designing solution
maps between function spaces in the form of neural networks. Differently from
classical scientific machine learning approaches that learn parameters of a
known partial differential equation (PDE) for a single instance of the input
parameters at a fixed resolution, neural operators approximate the solution map
of a family of PDEs. Despite their success, the uses of neural operators are so
far restricted to relatively shallow neural networks and confined to learning
hidden governing laws. In this work, we propose a novel nonlocal neural
operator, which we refer to as nonlocal kernel network (NKN), that is
resolution independent, characterized by deep neural networks, and capable of
handling a variety of tasks such as learning governing equations and
classifying images. Our NKN stems from the interpretation of the neural network
as a discrete nonlocal diffusion reaction equation that, in the limit of
infinite layers, is equivalent to a parabolic nonlocal equation, whose
stability is analyzed via nonlocal vector calculus. The resemblance with
integral forms of neural operators allows NKNs to capture long-range
dependencies in the feature space, while the continuous treatment of
node-to-node interactions makes NKNs resolution independent. The resemblance
with neural ODEs, reinterpreted in a nonlocal sense, and the stable network
dynamics between layers allow for generalization of NKN&#x27;s optimal parameters
from shallow to deep networks. This fact enables the use of shallow-to-deep
initialization techniques. Our tests show that NKNs outperform baseline methods
in both learning governing equations and image classification tasks and
generalize well to different resolutions and depths.</span>

                    <span>COVID-19 pandemic, is still unknown and is an important open question. There
are speculations that bats are a possible origin. Likewise, there are many
closely related (corona-) viruses, such as SARS, which was found to be
transmitted through civets. The study of the different hosts which can be
potential carriers and transmitters of deadly viruses to humans is crucial to
understanding, mitigating and preventing current and future pandemics. In
coronaviruses, the surface (S) protein, or spike protein, is an important part
of determining host specificity since it is the point of contact between the
virus and the host cell membrane. In this paper, we classify the hosts of over
five thousand coronaviruses from their spike protein sequences, segregating
them into clusters of distinct hosts among avians, bats, camels, swines, humans
and weasels, to name a few. We propose a feature embedding based on the
well-known position-weight matrix (PWM), which we call PWM2Vec, and use to
generate feature vectors from the spike protein sequences of these
coronaviruses. While our embedding is inspired by the success of PWMs in
biological applications such as determining protein function, or identifying
transcription factor binding sites, we are the first (to the best of our
knowledge) to use PWMs in the context of host classification from viral
sequences to generate a fixed-length feature vector representation. The results
on the real world data show that in using PWM2Vec, we are able to perform
comparably well as compared to baseline models. We also measure the importance
of different amino acids using information gain to show the amino acids which
are important for predicting the host of a given coronavirus.</span>

                    <span>We study the effect of adversarial perturbations of images on deep stereo
matching networks for the disparity estimation task. We present a method to
craft a single set of perturbations that, when added to any stereo image pair
in a dataset, can fool a stereo network to significantly alter the perceived
scene geometry. Our perturbation images are &quot;universal&quot; in that they not only
corrupt estimates of the network on the dataset they are optimized for, but
also generalize to stereo networks with different architectures across
different datasets. We evaluate our approach on multiple public benchmark
datasets and show that our perturbations can increase D1-error (akin to fooling
rate) of state-of-the-art stereo networks from 1% to as much as 87%. We
investigate the effect of perturbations on the estimated scene geometry and
identify object classes that are most vulnerable. Our analysis on the
activations of registered points between left and right images led us to find
that certain architectural components, i.e. deformable convolution and explicit
matching, can increase robustness against adversaries. We demonstrate that by
simply designing networks with such components, one can reduce the effect of
adversaries by up to 60.5%, which rivals the robustness of networks fine-tuned
with costly adversarial data augmentation.</span>

                    <span>This paper presents FogAdapt, a novel approach for domain adaptation of
semantic segmentation for dense foggy scenes. Although significant research has
been directed to reduce the domain shift in semantic segmentation, adaptation
to scenes with adverse weather conditions remains an open question. Large
variations in the visibility of the scene due to weather conditions, such as
fog, smog, and haze, exacerbate the domain shift, thus making unsupervised
adaptation in such scenarios challenging. We propose a self-entropy and
multi-scale information augmented self-supervised domain adaptation method
(FogAdapt) to minimize the domain shift in foggy scenes segmentation. Supported
by the empirical evidence that an increase in fog density results in high
self-entropy for segmentation probabilities, we introduce a self-entropy based
loss function to guide the adaptation method. Furthermore, inferences obtained
at different image scales are combined and weighted by the uncertainty to
generate scale-invariant pseudo-labels for the target domain. These
scale-invariant pseudo-labels are robust to visibility and scale variations. We
evaluate the proposed model on real clear-weather scenes to real foggy scenes
adaptation and synthetic non-foggy images to real foggy scenes adaptation
scenarios. Our experiments demonstrate that FogAdapt significantly outperforms
the current state-of-the-art in semantic segmentation of foggy images.
Specifically, by considering the standard settings compared to state-of-the-art
(SOTA) methods, FogAdapt gains 3.8% on Foggy Zurich, 6.0% on Foggy
Driving-dense, and 3.6% on Foggy Driving in mIoU when adapted from Cityscapes
to Foggy Zurich.</span>

                    <span>The rise of deep learning algorithms has led many researchers to withdraw
from using classic signal processing methods for sound generation. Deep
learning models have achieved expressive voice synthesis, realistic sound
textures, and musical notes from virtual instruments. However, the most
suitable deep learning architecture is still under investigation. The choice of
architecture is tightly coupled to the audio representations. A sound&#x27;s
original waveform can be too dense and rich for deep learning models to deal
with efficiently - and complexity increases training time and computational
cost. Also, it does not represent sound in the manner in which it is perceived.
Therefore, in many cases, the raw audio has been transformed into a compressed
and more meaningful form using upsampling, feature-extraction, or even by
adopting a higher level illustration of the waveform. Furthermore, conditional
on the form chosen, additional conditioning representations, different model
architectures, and numerous metrics for evaluating the reconstructed sound have
been investigated. This paper provides an overview of audio representations
applied to sound synthesis using deep learning. Additionally, it presents the
most significant methods for developing and evaluating a sound synthesis
architecture using deep learning models, always depending on the audio
representation.</span>

                    <span>Multi-task learning is to improve the performance of the model by
transferring and exploiting common knowledge among tasks. Existing MTL works
mainly focus on the scenario where label sets among multiple tasks (MTs) are
usually the same, thus they can be utilized for learning across the tasks.
While almost rare works explore the scenario where each task only has a small
amount of training samples, and their label sets are just partially overlapped
or even not. Learning such MTs is more challenging because of less correlation
information available among these tasks. For this, we propose a framework to
learn these tasks by jointly leveraging both abundant information from a learnt
auxiliary big task with sufficiently many classes to cover those of all these
tasks and the information shared among those partially-overlapped tasks. In our
implementation of using the same neural network architecture of the learnt
auxiliary task to learn individual tasks, the key idea is to utilize available
label information to adaptively prune the hidden layer neurons of the auxiliary
network to construct corresponding network for each task, while accompanying a
joint learning across individual tasks. Our experimental results demonstrate
its effectiveness in comparison with the state-of-the-art approaches.</span>

                    <span>We design a machine learning technique to solve the general problem of
inferring physical parameters from the observation of turbulent flows, a
relevant exercise in many theoretical and applied fields, from engineering to
earth observation and astrophysics. Our approach is to train the machine
learning system to regress the rotation frequency of the flow&#x27;s reference
frame, from the observation of the flow&#x27;s velocity amplitude on a 2d plane
extracted from the 3d domain. The machine learning approach consists of a Deep
Convolutional Neural Network (DCNN) of the same kind developed in computer
vision. The training and validation datasets are produced by means of fully
resolved direct numerical simulations. This study shows interesting results
from two different points of view. From the machine learning point of view it
shows the potential of DCNN, reaching good results on such a particularly
complex problem that goes well outside the limits of human vision. Second, from
the physics point of view, it provides an example on how machine learning can
be exploited in data analysis to infer information that would be inaccessible
otherwise. Indeed, by comparing DCNN with the other possible Bayesian
approaches, we find that DCNN yields to a much higher inference accuracy in all
the examined cases.</span>

                    <span>In this paper, we consider a highly general image recognition setting
wherein, given a labelled and unlabelled set of images, the task is to
categorize all images in the unlabelled set. Here, the unlabelled images may
come from labelled classes or from novel ones. Existing recognition methods are
not able to deal with this setting, because they make several restrictive
assumptions, such as the unlabelled instances only coming from known - or
unknown - classes and the number of unknown classes being known a-priori. We
address the more unconstrained setting, naming it &#x27;Generalized Category
Discovery&#x27;, and challenge all these assumptions. We first establish strong
baselines by taking state-of-the-art algorithms from novel category discovery
and adapting them for this task. Next, we propose the use of vision
transformers with contrastive representation learning for this open world
setting. We then introduce a simple yet effective semi-supervised $k$-means
method to cluster the unlabelled data into seen and unseen classes
automatically, substantially outperforming the baselines. Finally, we also
propose a new approach to estimate the number of classes in the unlabelled
data. We thoroughly evaluate our approach on public datasets for generic object
classification including CIFAR10, CIFAR100 and ImageNet-100, and for
fine-grained visual recognition including CUB, Stanford Cars and Herbarium19,
benchmarking on this new setting to foster future research.</span>

                    <span>Classification models are a fundamental component of physical-asset
management technologies such as structural health monitoring (SHM) systems and
digital twins. Previous work introduced \textit{risk-based active learning}, an
online approach for the development of statistical classifiers that takes into
account the decision-support context in which they are applied. Decision-making
is considered by preferentially querying data labels according to
\textit{expected value of perfect information} (EVPI). Although several
benefits are gained by adopting a risk-based active learning approach,
including improved decision-making performance, the algorithms suffer from
issues relating to sampling bias as a result of the guided querying process.
This sampling bias ultimately manifests as a decline in decision-making
performance during the later stages of active learning, which in turn
corresponds to lost resource/utility.

The current paper proposes two novel approaches to counteract the effects of
sampling bias: \textit{semi-supervised learning}, and \textit{discriminative
classification models}. These approaches are first visualised using a synthetic
dataset, then subsequently applied to an experimental case study, specifically,
the Z24 Bridge dataset. The semi-supervised learning approach is shown to have
variable performance; with robustness to sampling bias dependent on the
suitability of the generative distributions selected for the model with respect
to each dataset. In contrast, the discriminative classifiers are shown to have
excellent robustness to the effects of sampling bias. Moreover, it was found
that the number of inspections made during a monitoring campaign, and therefore
resource expenditure, could be reduced with the careful selection of the
statistical classifiers used within a decision-supporting monitoring system.</span>

                    <span>The similarity of feature representations plays a pivotal role in the success
of problems related to domain adaptation. Feature similarity includes both the
invariance of marginal distributions and the closeness of conditional
distributions given the desired response $y$ (e.g., class labels).
Unfortunately, traditional methods always learn such features without fully
taking into consideration the information in $y$, which in turn may lead to a
mismatch of the conditional distributions or the mix-up of discriminative
structures underlying data distributions. In this work, we introduce the
recently proposed von Neumann conditional divergence to improve the
transferability across multiple domains. We show that this new divergence is
differentiable and eligible to easily quantify the functional dependence
between features and $y$. Given multiple source tasks, we integrate this
divergence to capture discriminative information in $y$ and design novel
learning objectives assuming those source tasks are observed either
simultaneously or sequentially. In both scenarios, we obtain favorable
performance against state-of-the-art methods in terms of smaller generalization
error on new tasks and less catastrophic forgetting on source tasks (in the
sequential setup).</span>

                    <span>Understanding capabilities and limitations of different network architectures
is of fundamental importance to machine learning. Bayesian inference on
Gaussian processes has proven to be a viable approach for studying recurrent
and deep networks in the limit of infinite layer width, $n\to\infty$. Here we
present a unified and systematic derivation of the mean-field theory for both
architectures that starts from first principles by employing established
methods from statistical physics of disordered systems. The theory elucidates
that while the mean-field equations are different with regard to their temporal
structure, they yet yield identical Gaussian kernels when readouts are taken at
a single time point or layer, respectively. Bayesian inference applied to
classification then predicts identical performance and capabilities for the two
architectures. Numerically, we find that convergence towards the mean-field
theory is typically slower for recurrent networks than for deep networks and
the convergence speed depends non-trivially on the parameters of the weight
prior as well as the depth or number of time steps, respectively. Our method
exposes that Gaussian processes are but the lowest order of a systematic
expansion in $1/n$. The formalism thus paves the way to investigate the
fundamental differences between recurrent and deep architectures at finite
widths $n$.</span>

represented by a neural network with ReLU activations and a given architecture.
Using techniques from mixed-integer optimization, polyhedral theory, and
tropical geometry, we provide a mathematical counterbalance to the universal
approximation theorems which suggest that a single hidden layer is sufficient
for learning tasks. In particular, we investigate whether the class of exactly
representable functions strictly increases by adding more layers (with no
restrictions on size). This problem has potential impact on algorithmic and
statistical aspects because of the insight it provides into the class of
functions represented by neural hypothesis classes. However, to the best of our
knowledge, this question has not been investigated in the neural network
literature. We also present upper bounds on the sizes of neural networks
required to represent functions in these neural hypothesis classes.</span>

in data sets which deviate from the norm significantly. In this study, we
propose a signatures based machine learning algorithm to detect rare or
unexpected items in a given data set of time series type. We present
applications of signature or randomized signature as feature extractors for
anomaly detection algorithms; additionally we provide an easy, representation
theoretic justification for the construction of randomized signatures. Our
first application is based on synthetic data and aims at distinguishing between
real and fake trajectories of stock prices, which are indistinguishable by
visual inspection. We also show a real life application by using transaction
data from the cryptocurrency market. In this case, we are able to identify pump
and dump attempts organized on social networks with F1 scores up to 88% by
means of our unsupervised learning algorithm, thus achieving results that are
close to the state-of-the-art in the field based on supervised learning.</span>

                    <span>We are concerned with the problem of hyperparameter selection of offline
policy evaluation (OPE). OPE is a key component of offline reinforcement
learning, which is a core technology for data-driven decision optimization
without environment simulators. However, the current state-of-the-art OPE
methods are not hyperparameter-free, which undermines their utility in
real-life applications. We address this issue by introducing a new approximate
hyperparameter selection (AHS) framework for OPE, which defines a notion of
optimality (called selection criteria) in a quantitative and interpretable
manner without hyperparameters. We then derive four AHS methods each of which
has different characteristics such as convergence rate and time complexity.
Finally, we verify effectiveness and limitation of these methods with a
preliminary experiment.</span>

                    <span>Clustering is a fundamental primitive in unsupervised learning which gives
rise to a rich class of computationally-challenging inference tasks. In this
work, we focus on the canonical task of clustering d-dimensional Gaussian
mixtures with unknown (and possibly degenerate) covariance. Recent works (Ghosh
et al. &#x27;20; Mao, Wein &#x27;21; Davis, Diaz, Wang &#x27;21) have established lower bounds
against the class of low-degree polynomial methods and the sum-of-squares (SoS)
hierarchy for recovering certain hidden structures planted in Gaussian
clustering instances. Prior work on many similar inference tasks portends that
such lower bounds strongly suggest the presence of an inherent
statistical-to-computational gap for clustering, that is, a parameter regime
where the clustering task is statistically possible but no polynomial-time
algorithm succeeds.

One special case of the clustering task we consider is equivalent to the
problem of finding a planted hypercube vector in an otherwise random subspace.
We show that, perhaps surprisingly, this particular clustering model does not
exhibit a statistical-to-computational gap, even though the aforementioned
low-degree and SoS lower bounds continue to apply in this case. To achieve
this, we give a polynomial-time algorithm based on the Lenstra--Lenstra--Lovasz
lattice basis reduction method which achieves the statistically-optimal sample
complexity of d+1 samples. This result extends the class of problems whose
conjectured statistical-to-computational gaps can be &quot;closed&quot; by &quot;brittle&quot;
polynomial-time algorithms, highlighting the crucial but subtle role of noise
in the onset of statistical-to-computational gaps.</span>

                    <span>An important problem in causal inference is to break down the total effect of
a treatment on an outcome into different causal pathways and to quantify the
causal effect in each pathway. For instance, in causal fairness, the total
effect of being a male employee (i.e., treatment) constitutes its direct effect
on annual income (i.e., outcome) and the indirect effect via the employee&#x27;s
occupation (i.e., mediator). Causal mediation analysis (CMA) is a formal
statistical framework commonly used to reveal such underlying causal
mechanisms. One major challenge of CMA in observational studies is handling
confounders, variables that cause spurious causal relationships among
treatment, mediator, and outcome. Conventional methods assume sequential
ignorability that implies all confounders can be measured, which is often
unverifiable in practice. This work aims to circumvent the stringent sequential
ignorability assumptions and consider hidden confounders. Drawing upon proxy
strategies and recent advances in deep learning, we propose to simultaneously
uncover the latent variables that characterize hidden confounders and estimate
the causal effects. Empirical evaluations using both synthetic and
semi-synthetic datasets validate the effectiveness of the proposed method. We
further show the potentials of our approach for causal fairness analysis.</span>

                    <span>Neural operators have recently become popular tools for designing solution
maps between function spaces in the form of neural networks. Differently from
classical scientific machine learning approaches that learn parameters of a
known partial differential equation (PDE) for a single instance of the input
parameters at a fixed resolution, neural operators approximate the solution map
of a family of PDEs. Despite their success, the uses of neural operators are so
far restricted to relatively shallow neural networks and confined to learning
hidden governing laws. In this work, we propose a novel nonlocal neural
operator, which we refer to as nonlocal kernel network (NKN), that is
resolution independent, characterized by deep neural networks, and capable of
handling a variety of tasks such as learning governing equations and
classifying images. Our NKN stems from the interpretation of the neural network
as a discrete nonlocal diffusion reaction equation that, in the limit of
infinite layers, is equivalent to a parabolic nonlocal equation, whose
stability is analyzed via nonlocal vector calculus. The resemblance with
integral forms of neural operators allows NKNs to capture long-range
dependencies in the feature space, while the continuous treatment of
node-to-node interactions makes NKNs resolution independent. The resemblance
with neural ODEs, reinterpreted in a nonlocal sense, and the stable network
dynamics between layers allow for generalization of NKN&#x27;s optimal parameters
from shallow to deep networks. This fact enables the use of shallow-to-deep
initialization techniques. Our tests show that NKNs outperform baseline methods
in both learning governing equations and image classification tasks and
generalize well to different resolutions and depths.</span>

                    <span>We develop the &quot;generalized consistent weighted sampling&quot; (GCWS) for hashing
the &quot;powered-GMM&quot; (pGMM) kernel (with a tuning parameter $p$). It turns out
that GCWS provides a numerically stable scheme for applying power
transformation on the original data, regardless of the magnitude of $p$ and the
data. The power transformation is often effective for boosting the performance,
in many cases considerably so. We feed the hashed data to neural networks on a
variety of public classification datasets and name our method &#x60;&#x60;GCWSNet&#x27;&#x27;. Our
extensive experiments show that GCWSNet often improves the classification
accuracy. Furthermore, it is evident from the experiments that GCWSNet
converges substantially faster. In fact, GCWS often reaches a reasonable
accuracy with merely (less than) one epoch of the training process. This
property is much desired because many applications, such as advertisement
click-through rate (CTR) prediction models, or data streams (i.e., data seen
only once), often train just one epoch. Another beneficial side effect is that
the computations of the first layer of the neural networks become additions
instead of multiplications because the input data become binary (and highly
sparse).

Empirical comparisons with (normalized) random Fourier features (NRFF) are
provided. We also propose to reduce the model size of GCWSNet by count-sketch
and develop the theory for analyzing the impact of using count-sketch on the
accuracy of GCWS. Our analysis shows that an &#x60;&#x60;8-bit&#x27;&#x27; strategy should work
well in that we can always apply an 8-bit count-sketch hashing on the output of
GCWS hashing without hurting the accuracy much. There are many other ways to
take advantage of GCWS when training deep neural networks. For example, one can
apply GCWS on the outputs of the last layer to boost the accuracy of trained
deep neural networks.</span>

                    <span>Rankings and scores are two common data types used by judges to express
preferences and/or perceptions of quality in a collection of objects. Numerous
models exist to study data of each type separately, but no unified statistical
model captures both data types simultaneously without first performing data
conversion. We propose the Mallows-Binomial model to close this gap, which
combines a Mallows&#x27; $\phi$ ranking model with Binomial score models through
shared parameters that quantify object quality, a consensus ranking, and the
level of consensus between judges. We propose an efficient tree-search
algorithm to calculate the exact MLE of model parameters, study statistical
properties of the model both analytically and through simulation, and apply our
model to real data from an instance of grant panel review that collected both
scores and partial rankings. Furthermore, we demonstrate how model outputs can
be used to rank objects with confidence. The proposed model is shown to
sensibly combine information from both scores and rankings to quantify object
quality and measure consensus with appropriate levels of statistical
uncertainty.</span>

                    <span>We study the problem of matrix completion in this paper. A spectral scaled
Student prior is exploited to favour the underlying low-rank structure of the
data matrix. We provide a thorough theoretical investigation for our approach
through PAC-Bayesian bounds. More precisely, our PAC-Bayesian approach enjoys a
minimax-optimal oracle inequality which guarantees that our method works well
under model misspecification and under general sampling distribution.
Interestingly, we also provide efficient gradient-based sampling
implementations for our approach by using Langevin Monte Carlo. More
specifically, we show that our algorithms are significantly faster than Gibbs
sampler in this problem. To illustrate the attractive features of our inference
strategy, some numerical simulations are conducted and an application to image
inpainting is demonstrated.</span>

                    <span>Numerical models based on physics represent the state-of-the-art in earth
system modeling and comprise our best tools for generating insights and
predictions. Despite rapid growth in computational power, the perceived need
for higher model resolutions overwhelms the latest-generation computers,
reducing the ability of modelers to generate simulations for understanding
parameter sensitivities and characterizing variability and uncertainty. Thus,
surrogate models are often developed to capture the essential attributes of the
full-blown numerical models. Recent successes of machine learning methods,
especially deep learning, across many disciplines offer the possibility that
complex nonlinear connectionist representations may be able to capture the
underlying complex structures and nonlinear processes in earth systems. A
difficult test for deep learning-based emulation, which refers to function
approximation of numerical models, is to understand whether they can be
comparable to traditional forms of surrogate models in terms of computational
efficiency while simultaneously reproducing model results in a credible manner.
A deep learning emulation that passes this test may be expected to perform even
better than simple models with respect to capturing complex processes and
spatiotemporal dependencies. Here we examine, with a case study in
satellite-based remote sensing, the hypothesis that deep learning approaches
can credibly represent the simulations from a surrogate model with comparable
computational efficiency. Our results are encouraging in that the deep learning
emulation reproduces the results with acceptable accuracy and often even faster
performance. We discuss the broader implications of our results in light of the
pace of improvements in high-performance implementations of deep learning as
well as the growing desire for higher-resolution simulations in the earth
sciences.</span>

                    <span>Deep autoencoders are often extended with a supervised or adversarial loss to
learn latent representations with desirable properties, such as greater
predictivity of labels and outcomes or fairness with respects to a sensitive
variable. Despite the ubiquity of supervised and adversarial deep latent factor
models, these methods should demonstrate improvement over simpler linear
approaches to be preferred in practice. This necessitates a reproducible linear
analog that still adheres to an augmenting supervised or adversarial objective.
We address this methodological gap by presenting methods that augment the
principal component analysis (PCA) objective with either a supervised or an
adversarial objective and provide analytic and reproducible solutions. We
implement these methods in an open-source Python package, AugmentedPCA, that
can produce excellent real-world baselines. We demonstrate the utility of these
factor models on an open-source, RNA-seq cancer gene expression dataset,
showing that augmenting with a supervised objective results in improved
downstream classification performance, produces principal components with
greater class fidelity, and facilitates identification of genes aligned with
the principal axes of data variance with implications to development of
specific types of cancer.</span>

                    <span>We investigate the functioning of a classifying biological neural network
from the perspective of statistical learning theory, modelled, in a simplified
setting, as a continuous-time stochastic recurrent neural network (RNN) with
identity activation function. In the purely stochastic (robust) regime, we give
a generalisation error bound that holds with high probability, thus showing
that the empirical risk minimiser is the best-in-class hypothesis. We show that
RNNs retain a partial signature of the paths they are fed as the unique
information exploited for training and classification tasks. We argue that
these RNNs are easy to train and robust and back these observations with
numerical experiments on both synthetic and real data. We also exhibit a
trade-off phenomenon between accuracy and robustness.</span>

                    <span>Recent work learns contextual representations of source code by
reconstructing tokens from their context. For downstream semantic understanding
tasks like summarizing code in English, these representations should ideally
capture program functionality. However, we show that the popular
reconstruction-based BERT model is sensitive to source code edits, even when
the edits preserve semantics. We propose ContraCode: a contrastive pre-training
task that learns code functionality, not form. ContraCode pre-trains a neural
network to identify functionally similar variants of a program among many
non-equivalent distractors. We scalably generate these variants using an
automated source-to-source compiler as a form of data augmentation. Contrastive
pre-training improves JavaScript summarization and TypeScript type inference
accuracy by 2% to 13%. We also propose a new zero-shot JavaScript code clone
detection dataset, showing that ContraCode is both more robust and semantically
meaningful. On it, we outperform RoBERTa by 39% AUROC in an adversarial setting
and up to 5% on natural code.</span>

                    <span>Recent advances in AIoT technologies have led to an increasing popularity of
utilizing machine learning algorithms to detect operational failures for
cyber-physical systems (CPS). In its basic form, an anomaly detection module
monitors the sensor measurements and actuator states from the physical plant,
and detects anomalies in these measurements to identify abnormal operation
status. Nevertheless, building effective anomaly detection models for CPS is
rather challenging as the model has to accurately detect anomalies in presence
of highly complicated system dynamics and unknown amount of sensor noise. In
this work, we propose a novel time series anomaly detection method called
Neural System Identification and Bayesian Filtering (NSIBF) in which a
specially crafted neural network architecture is posed for system
identification, i.e., capturing the dynamics of CPS in a dynamical state-space
model; then a Bayesian filtering algorithm is naturally applied on top of the
&quot;identified&quot; state-space model for robust anomaly detection by tracking the
uncertainty of the hidden state of the system recursively over time. We provide
qualitative as well as quantitative experiments with the proposed method on a
synthetic and three real-world CPS datasets, showing that NSIBF compares
favorably to the state-of-the-art methods with considerable improvements on
anomaly detection in CPS.</span>

                    <span>This paper proposes a novel acoustic word embedding called Acoustic Neighbor
Embeddings where speech or text of arbitrary length are mapped to a vector
space of fixed, reduced dimensions by adapting stochastic neighbor embedding
(SNE) to sequential inputs. The Euclidean distance between coordinates in the
embedding space reflects the phonetic confusability between their corresponding
sequences. Two encoder neural networks are trained: an acoustic encoder that
accepts speech signals in the form of frame-wise subword posterior
probabilities obtained from an acoustic model and a text encoder that accepts
text in the form of subword transcriptions. Compared to a triplet loss
criterion, the proposed method is shown to have more effective gradients for
neural network training. Experimentally, it also gives more accurate results
with low-dimensional embeddings when the two encoder networks are used in
tandem in a word (name) recognition task, and when the text encoder network is
used standalone in an approximate phonetic matching task. In particular, in an
isolated name recognition task depending solely on Euclidean nearest-neighbor
search between the proposed embedding vectors, the recognition accuracy is
identical to that of conventional finite state transducer(FST)-based decoding
using test data with up to 1 million names in the vocabulary and 40 dimensions
in the embeddings.</span>

                    <span>The similarity between objects is significant in a broad range of areas.
While similarity can be measured using off-the-shelf distance functions, they
may fail to capture the inherent meaning of similarity, which tends to depend
on the underlying data and task. Moreover, conventional distance functions
limit the space of similarity measures to be symmetric and do not directly
allow comparing objects from different spaces. We propose using quantum
networks (GQSim) for learning task-dependent (a)symmetric similarity between
data that need not have the same dimensionality. We analyze the properties of
such similarity function analytically (for a simple case) and numerically (for
a complex case) and showthat these similarity measures can extract salient
features of the data. We also demonstrate that the similarity measure derived
using this technique is $(\epsilon,\gamma,\tau)$-good, resulting in
theoretically guaranteed performance. Finally, we conclude by applying this
technique for three relevant applications - Classification, Graph Completion,
Generative modeling.</span>

                    <span>In time series data analysis, detecting change points on a real-time basis
(online) is of great interest in many areas, such as finance, environmental
monitoring, and medicine. One promising means to achieve this is the Bayesian
online change point detection (BOCPD) algorithm, which has been successfully
adopted in particular cases in which the time series of interest has a fixed
baseline. However, we have found that the algorithm struggles when the baseline
irreversibly shifts from its initial state. This is because with the original
BOCPD algorithm, the sensitivity with which a change point can be detected is
degraded if the data points are fluctuating at locations relatively far from
the original baseline. In this paper, we not only extend the original BOCPD
algorithm to be applicable to a time series whose baseline is constantly
shifting toward unknown values but also visualize why the proposed extension
works. To demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed algorithm compared to the
original one, we examine these algorithms on two real-world data sets and six
synthetic data sets.</span>

                    <span>Data scientists and statisticians are often at odds when determining the best
approach, machine learning or statistical modeling, to solve an analytics
challenge. However, machine learning and statistical modeling are more cousins
than adversaries on different sides of an analysis battleground. Choosing
between the two approaches or in some cases using both is based on the problem
to be solved and outcomes required as well as the data available for use and
circumstances of the analysis. Machine learning and statistical modeling are
complementary, based on similar mathematical principles, but simply using
different tools in an overall analytics knowledge base. Determining the
predominant approach should be based on the problem to be solved as well as
empirical evidence, such as size and completeness of the data, number of
variables, assumptions or lack thereof, and expected outcomes such as
predictions or causality. Good analysts and data scientists should be well
versed in both techniques and their proper application, thereby using the right
tool for the right project to achieve the desired results.</span>

                    <span>One of the fundamental assumptions in stochastic control of continuous time
processes is that the dynamics of the underlying (diffusion) process is known.
This is, however, usually obviously not fulfilled in practice. On the other
hand, over the last decades, a rich theory for nonparametric estimation of the
drift (and volatility) for continuous time processes has been developed. The
aim of this paper is bringing together techniques from stochastic control with
methods from statistics for stochastic processes to find a way to both learn
the dynamics of the underlying process and control in a reasonable way at the
same time. More precisely, we study a long-term average impulse control
problem, a stochastic version of the classical Faustmann timber harvesting
problem. One of the problems that immediately arises is an
exploration-exploitation dilemma as is well known for problems in machine
learning. We propose a way to deal with this issue by combining exploration and
exploitation periods in a suitable way. Our main finding is that this
construction can be based on the rates of convergence of estimators for the
invariant density. Using this, we obtain that the average cumulated regret is
of uniform order $O({T^{-1/3}})$.</span>

                    <span>Cybersecurity continues to be a top concern for enterprises. Yet the constantly evolving threat landscape that they face makes it harder than ever to be confident in their cybersecurity protections. To address this, ReliaQuest built GreyMatter, an Open XDR-as-a-Service platform that brings together telemetry from any security and business solution, whether on-premises or in one or multiple clouds, to unify detection, investigation, response, and resilience. In 2021, ReliaQuest turned to AWS to help it enhance its artificial intelligence (AI) capabilities and build new features faster.</span>

                    <span>Text-to-Speech (TTS) synthesis is achieved using current voice cloning methods for a new voice. They do not, however, manipulate the expressiveness of synthesized sounds. The task of learning to synthesize the speech of an unseen speaker with the least amount of training is known as voice cloning.
 UC San Diego researchers propose a Controllable voice cloning method that offers fine-grained control over many style features of synthetic speech for an unseen speaker. The voice synthesis model is explicitly conditioned on a speaker encoding, pitch contour, and latent style tokens during training. Continue Reading

                    <span>A team from Google Research, University of Pennsylvania and Cornell University proposes a principled perspective to filter out common memorization for LMs, introducing &quot;counterfactual memorization&quot; to measure the expected change in a model’s prediction and distinguish “rare” (episodic) memorization from “common” (semantic) memorization in neural LMs. 
 Here is a quick read: Counterfactual Memorization in Language Models: Distinguishing Rare from Common Memorization.

                    <span>In a working environment quite often errors are accounted to the contingent/individual because it is considered to be the cheapest fix to blame one rather than rethinking an entire process. Middle-end employees - like project managers - won&#x27;t have anyone to blame if bottom-end employees are all replaced by - not infallible but fair - AI . They&#x27;ll find themselves working for AI and not the other way around. By breaking the the blame cycle, this &quot;fairness&quot; responsibility might backpropagate higher than bottom to mid-end and induce a more radical systematical change.

                    <span>Very interesting to see this technology become more popular and spread. Friends have been using tools like hyperwrite and speedwrite to get ideas for their writing and assist with drafts, and it seems like more and more people are talking about this as the technology becomes more accessible. It will be interesting to see how this technology will impact the future of education, and curious if any students (or others) have tried writing tools like this? Just started getting really exposed to this stuff and loving it!

                    <span>Transformers have recently demonstrated promising performance in a variety of visual tests. Inspired by Transformer’s success on a wide range of NLP tasks, Vision Transformer (ViT) first employed a pure Transformer architecture for image classification, demonstrating the promising performance of Transformer architecture for vision tasks.
 However, the quadratic complexity of global self-attention leads to high computing costs and memory use, particularly for high-resolution situations, rendering it unsuitable for use in diverse visual tasks. Various strategies confine the range of attention inside a local region to increase efficiency and lower the quadratic computing complexity generated by global self-attention. As a result, their receptive fields in a single attention layer are insufficiently big, resulting in poor context modeling. 
 A new Pale-Shaped self-Attention (PS-Attention) method executes self-attention inside a pale-shaped zone to solve this issue. Compared to global self-attention, PS-Attention can considerably lower compute and memory expenses. Meanwhile, it can collect more fantastic contextual information while maintaining the same computational complexity as earlier local self-attention techniques. Continue Reading

                    <span>Hello all, I currently have a issue and I&#x27;d like to hear some advice on how to tackle the given problem. I&#x27;m running independent trials, where for each trial a series of variables are recorded at each timestep, where each trial lasts for different periods of time. The outcome of each trial is a single value. I&#x27;d like to predict this single output value given the dynamic timesteps for time series variables. To give a visual example, here is what some data would look like:
 ​
 https://preview.redd.it/ssz9dlb74ya81.png?width&#x3D;704&amp;format&#x3D;png&amp;auto&#x3D;webp&amp;s&#x3D;da8cd49520e5570e45bdc85ff5e7cf9f7ff75ef6
 Each of the first 8 columns represents a variable, where each row represents a different timestep, and each blank row separates the timesteps into chunks, where each chunk is a trial; and the last column is the single value resulting from each trial that I&#x27;d like to predict. Any advice on how to tackle this problem of predicting the last column given a dynamic amount of timesteps for a set of timeseries variables???

                    <span>I was reading section 3.1.D of this paper on re-id and I had a question about this part:
 image of relevant part
 Specifically, both parts are minibatch losses. So why is the 1/Nb loss negative, and why would the 1/Ns loss be positive. Intuitively, the losses are summed, so it should be (-1/Nb)+(-1/Ns) &#x3D; -1/Nb - 1/Ns, right?

                    <span>Hi!
 In my PhD, I studied the design of neural architectures and how to design them without tremendous amounts of trial and error.This lib is my most significant insight compiled into a lightweight package.Simply speaking, I figured out how to predict useless / unproductive layers in CNN architectures.
 This library allows you to easily visualize neural architectures from PyTorch, with unproductive layers highlighted within in the topology. This makes it possible for you to spot inefficiencies within your CNN architecture reliably, without the need for a single training step!

                    <span>Hello everyone ! 
 While working on my PhD, I developed a Python package that I am pretty proud of. 
 It allows you to easily create diverse neural search pipelines with retrievers and pre-trained language models as rankers, and it works flawlessly with middle-sized corpus. 
 It is also currently trending #15 on HackerNews ! Check-it out !

                    <span>Oftentimes I encounter operations that I do not understand as a whole - which can be fixed by simply using dummy arrays and printing them out.
 However, that quickly becomes cumbersome. What do y&#x27;all use to visualize such complex tensor operations quickly and accurately to understand what exactly it accomplishes?

                    <span>Hello all,
 Many of us are having a hard time speeding up our Transformer based NLP models for inference in production.
 So I thought it would be worth writing an article that summarizes the options one should consider (GPU, batch inference, export to ONNX or Torchscript, using TensorRT, Deepspeed, Triton Inference Server... etc.):
 https://nlpcloud.io/how-to-speed-up-deep-learning-nlp-transformers-inference.html
 I hope you&#x27;ll find it useful. If you can think of additional options, please let me know and I&#x27;ll add them to the article!

                    <span>Hi guys, I just programmed my first neural network in Python using keras, but I’m not sure what loss functions and optimizer to use. I used mean squared error, which worked well, but I only have experience in the past using r2, so it’s not optimal. I am currently using ‘Adam’ as my optimizer, but I really don’t understand what this does. I am currently doing regression 28 input neurons leading to 1 output neuron, if that’s helpful. Thanks in advance for the help!

                    <span>I have implemented a Variational Autoencoder using Conv-6 CNN (VGG-* family) as the encoder and decoder with CIFAR-10 in PyTorch. You can refer to the full code here.
 The problem is that the total loss (&#x3D; reconstruction loss + KL-divergence loss) doesn&#x27;t improve. Also, the log-variance is almost 0 indicating further that the multivariate Gaussians being mapped in the latent space is not happening as expected, since the log variance should have values between say -4 to +3, etc. You can see this in this code where the log variance is changing and has a non-zero value.
 Suggestions to alleviate the situation?

                    <span>Hey guys!
 I´m wondering if we can apply Reinforcement Learning where an agent has two action spaces and at time t the agent has to select one of the action spaces (A or B).
 If it selects A there are n tasks that the agent must select one of them. The same for action space B, there are m choices that the agent must select among them.
 It´s a complicated problem. All I want is to know if this is possible?

                    <span>Hey guys, I have implemented and applied the Q-learning algorithm to the simple, grid environment. I defined terminating states, one with positive reward and others with negative rewards. And the training worked pretty well. Now, I wanted to enhance the process by adding the state with half reward,i.e., now there are 3 types of terminating states - a state with the biggest positive reward(100), a state with half of the reward(50), and the state with negative rewards(-100). As I said, they all terminate the process. However, when I test the trained agent, sometimes the agent goes to the state with half reward. So, the process is not as efficient as it was before. Could someone give me any tips on how to approach this problem? Is Q-learning a good approach for short-term vs long-term rewards? Thank you in advance!

                    <span>Hi,
 I have an issue with my algorithm which i can&#x27;t seem to find where the issue lies at. I&#x27;m using RLBench for the environment with Option Critic and DDPG as the agent. I&#x27;m trying out the reach target task. I&#x27;m not sure why but when i looked at the results, the arm ends up curling/trying to return to its initial position when it tries to solve the task at hand. This happened for the open box task as well where it tries to reach the box lid to open it before it swerves and curls up the robot&#x27;s base. Does anyone have any insight as to what is causing this issue?

One of my units is on A.I. and I want to conclude the unit with student debates on topics in AI. I&#x27;m struggling to come up with topic statements however. I know for sure I want one of the topics to be centered on whether A.I. at an advanced level should be afforded the same rights as humans. 
 Any other topic statement ideas? Thanks!

                    <span>Understanding indoor 3D scenes are becoming increasingly important in augmented reality, robotics, photography, games, and real estate. Many state-of-the-art scene interpretation algorithms have lately been driven by modern machine learning approaches. Depth estimation, 3D reconstruction, instance segmentation, object detection, and other methods are used to address distinct aspects of the problem.
 The majority of these studies are made possible by a range of real and synthetic RGB-D datasets that have been made available in recent years. Even though commercially accessible RGB-D sensors, such as Microsoft Kinect, have made the collection of such datasets possible, capturing data at a significant scale with ground truth is still a problematic issue.

                    <span>Admittedly, I am not an expert in machine learning or different libraries but the code I see as an example is not really beginner friendly. Even for an expert, I am not sure, they know all libraries and quircks of different datasets.
 Let me elaborate. The main problem I see is the use of magic numbers. For example, in below hypothetical code
 x &#x3D; dataset[1] 
 there is no indication of why 1 is used instead of 0 or what does it mean. May be 0th elemnt contains metadata/some useless data. Or in other cases, some axis is chosen without specifying why that is used and what are other axis to put in context.
 My only suggestion would be to not ever use a magic number unless it is immediately obvious. Can we not use an appropriately named constant in that case?
 MY_DATA_INDEX&#x3D;1 x &#x3D; dataset[MY_DATA_INDEX] 
 I believe this is a very simple and helpful convention to follow. If such conventions are already there, can someone point me to then? May be people aren&#x27;t just using them too often.

                    <span>Hi everyone, until recently I only had to work on problems for which a single GPU training setup would suffice. But i am working on a problem with a large dataset and I have access to multiple GPUs so I was wondering what&#x27;s the best way to set this up. Going through the PyTorch documentation, they seem to suggest using torch.distributed.run along with DistributedDataParallel for distributed training although I also came across libraries in which the boilerplate stuff is abstracted out such as PyTorch Lightening or DeepSpeed. Since I&#x27;m new to this, I just wanted an opinion on the route I should choose for training my Transformer models in a distributed way. Thanks in advance!

 For the last 6 months I have immersed in deep learning problem domain, and have been spending a lot of time catching up on the literature, few courses and doing some personal projects as well.
 But now, I&#x27;m at the point where I&#x27;d like to start contributing in a more meaningful way to the community. Does anyone have idea of good open source projects related to DL (maybe even classic machine learning) that are looking for contributors?
 Thanks for any suggestions!

                    <span>Hello there,
 I am working on a RL environment where an agent moves around in a certain area. At a certain time step, the agent needs to choose the direction of movement (out of 8 choices: up down right left and diagonally). I do get the performance I am expecting in terms of reward/task completion, but the agent&#x27;s movement is just not that smooth (see image below). What are my options here? 
  
I tried continuous action space (2 actions representing forces set on x and y axis), but that did not work really well.

                    <span>Hello Everyone,
 I am trying to implement a RL agent using using PPO with actor/critic. The agent has to move in an x-y plane by setting 2 discretized forces (2 actions) along its x and y axis. Initially I thought I need two output heads for my actor network, one for each action. However I came across this work by OpenAI, where they have a similar agent. They however use one output head for the movement action (along x y and z), where the action has a &quot;multidiscrete&quot; type. Any idea how this works? I have tried to understand it from the gym code but I dont get what &quot;multidiscrete&quot; does? Is it a way of encoding all the combinations of the different actions?
 Any help/insight is really appreciated

                    <span>Anomalous pattern detection aims to identify instances where deviation from
normalcy is evident, and is widely applicable across domains. Multiple
anomalous detection techniques have been proposed in the state of the art.
However, there is a common lack of a principled and scalable feature selection
method for efficient discovery. Existing feature selection techniques are often
conducted by optimizing the performance of prediction outcomes rather than its
systemic deviations from the expected. In this paper, we proposed a
sparsity-based automated feature selection (SAFS) framework, which encodes
systemic outcome deviations via the sparsity of feature-driven odds ratios.
SAFS is a model-agnostic approach with usability across different discovery
techniques. SAFS achieves more than $3\times$ reduction in computation time
while maintaining detection performance when validated on publicly available
critical care dataset. SAFS also results in a superior performance when
compared against multiple baselines for feature selection.</span>

                    <span>Generating images from a single sample, as a newly developing branch of image
synthesis, has attracted extensive attention. In this paper, we formulate this
problem as sampling from the conditional distribution of a single image, and
propose a hierarchical framework that simplifies the learning of the intricate
conditional distributions through the successive learning of the distributions
about structure, semantics and texture, making the process of learning and
generation comprehensible. On this basis, we design ExSinGAN composed of three
cascaded GANs for learning an explainable generative model from a given image,
where the cascaded GANs model the distributions about structure, semantics and
texture successively. ExSinGAN is learned not only from the internal patches of
the given image as the previous works did, but also from the external prior
obtained by the GAN inversion technique. Benefiting from the appropriate
combination of internal and external information, ExSinGAN has a more powerful
capability of generation and competitive generalization ability for the image
manipulation tasks compared with prior works.</span>

                    <span>We present a machine learning system that can quantify fine art paintings
with a set of visual elements and principles of art. This formal analysis is
fundamental for understanding art, but developing such a system is challenging.
Paintings have high visual complexities, but it is also difficult to collect
enough training data with direct labels. To resolve these practical
limitations, we introduce a novel mechanism, called proxy learning, which
learns visual concepts in paintings though their general relation to styles.
This framework does not require any visual annotation, but only uses style
labels and a general relationship between visual concepts and style. In this
paper, we propose a novel proxy model and reformulate four pre-existing methods
in the context of proxy learning. Through quantitative and qualitative
comparison, we evaluate these methods and compare their effectiveness in
quantifying the artistic visual concepts, where the general relationship is
estimated by language models; GloVe or BERT. The language modeling is a
practical and scalable solution requiring no labeling, but it is inevitably
imperfect. We demonstrate how the new proxy model is robust to the
imperfection, while the other models are sensitively affected by it.</span>

                    <span>Zero-Shot Learning (ZSL) aims to transfer classification capability from seen
to unseen classes. Recent methods have proved that generalization and
specialization are two essential abilities to achieve good performance in ZSL.
However, they all focus on only one of the abilities, resulting in models that
are either too general with the degraded classifying ability or too specialized
to generalize to unseen classes. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end
network with balanced generalization and specialization abilities, termed as
BGSNet, to take advantage of both abilities, and balance them at instance- and
dataset-level. Specifically, BGSNet consists of two branches: the
Generalization Network (GNet), which applies episodic meta-learning to learn
generalized knowledge, and the Balanced Specialization Network (BSNet), which
adopts multiple attentive extractors to extract discriminative features and
fulfill the instance-level balance. A novel self-adjusting diversity loss is
designed to optimize BSNet with less redundancy and more diversity. We further
propose a differentiable dataset-level balance and update the weights in a
linear annealing schedule to simulate network pruning and thus obtain the
optimal structure for BSNet at a low cost with dataset-level balance achieved.
Experiments on four benchmark datasets demonstrate our model&#x27;s effectiveness.
Sufficient component ablations prove the necessity of integrating
generalization and specialization abilities.</span>

many computing domains, security issues associated with ML are also emerging.
In the domain of systems security, many endeavors have been made to ensure ML
model and data confidentiality. ML computations are often inevitably performed
in untrusted environments and entail complex multi-party security requirements.
Hence, researchers have leveraged the Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) to
build confidential ML computation systems. We conduct a systematic and
comprehensive survey by classifying attack vectors and mitigation in
confidential ML computation in untrusted environments, analyzing the complex
security requirements in multi-party scenarios, and summarizing engineering
challenges in confidential ML implementation. Lastly, we suggest future
research directions based on our study.</span>

                    <span>The paper introduces a novel conditional independence (CI) based method for
linear and nonlinear, lagged and contemporaneous causal discovery from
observational time series in the causally sufficient case. Existing CI-based
methods such as the PC algorithm and also common methods from other frameworks
suffer from low recall and partially inflated false positives for strong
autocorrelation which is an ubiquitous challenge in time series. The novel
method, PCMCI$^+$, extends PCMCI [Runge et al., 2019b] to include discovery of
contemporaneous links. PCMCI$^+$ improves the reliability of CI tests by
optimizing the choice of conditioning sets and even benefits from
autocorrelation. The method is order-independent and consistent in the oracle
case. A broad range of numerical experiments demonstrates that PCMCI$^+$ has
higher adjacency detection power and especially more contemporaneous
orientation recall compared to other methods while better controlling false
positives. Optimized conditioning sets also lead to much shorter runtimes than
the PC algorithm. PCMCI$^+$ can be of considerable use in many real world
application scenarios where often time resolutions are too coarse to resolve
time delays and strong autocorrelation is present.</span>

Transformers, and Convolutional Neural Networks are three major techniques for
learning from sequential data. Among these methods, Temporal Convolutional
Networks (TCNs) which are scalable to very long sequences have achieved
remarkable progress in time series regression. However, the performance of TCNs
for sequence classification is not satisfactory because they use a skewed
connection protocol and output classes at the last position. Such asymmetry
restricts their performance for classification which depends on the whole
sequence. In this work, we propose a symmetric multi-scale architecture called
Circular Dilated Convolutional Neural Network (CDIL-CNN), where every position
has an equal chance to receive information from other positions at the previous
layers. Our model gives classification logits in all positions, and we can
apply a simple ensemble learning to achieve a better decision. We have tested
CDIL-CNN on various long sequential datasets. The experimental results show
that our method has superior performance over many state-of-the-art approaches.</span>

                    <span>Spectral clustering is one of the most popular clustering methods. However,
the high computational cost due to the involved eigen-decomposition procedure
can immediately hinder its applications in large-scale tasks. In this paper we
use spectrum-preserving node reduction to accelerate eigen-decomposition and
generate concise representations of data sets. Specifically, we create a small
number of pseudonodes based on spectral similarity. Then, standard spectral
clustering algorithm is performed on the smaller node set. Finally, each data
point in the original data set is assigned to the cluster as its representative
pseudo-node. The proposed framework run in nearly-linear time. Meanwhile, the
clustering accuracy can be significantly improved by mining concise
representations. The experimental results show dramatically improved clustering
performance when compared with state-of-the-art methods.</span>

                    <span>Logistic Bandits have recently undergone careful scrutiny by virtue of their
combined theoretical and practical relevance. This research effort delivered
statistically efficient algorithms, improving the regret of previous strategies
by exponentially large factors. Such algorithms are however strikingly costly
as they require $\Omega(t)$ operations at each round. On the other hand, a
different line of research focused on computational efficiency
($\mathcal{O}(1)$ per-round cost), but at the cost of letting go of the
aforementioned exponential improvements. Obtaining the best of both world is
unfortunately not a matter of marrying both approaches. Instead we introduce a
new learning procedure for Logistic Bandits. It yields confidence sets which
sufficient statistics can be easily maintained online without sacrificing
statistical tightness. Combined with efficient planning mechanisms we design
fast algorithms which regret performance still match the problem-dependent
lower-bound of Abeille et al. (2021). To the best of our knowledge, those are
the first Logistic Bandit algorithms that simultaneously enjoy statistical and
computational efficiency.</span>

                    <span>Existed pre-trained models have achieved state-of-the-art performance on
various text classification tasks. These models have proven to be useful in
learning universal language representations. However, the semantic discrepancy
between similar texts cannot be effectively distinguished by advanced
pre-trained models, which have a great influence on the performance of
hard-to-distinguish classes. To address this problem, we propose a novel
Contrastive Learning with Label Distance (CLLD) in this work. Inspired by
recent advances in contrastive learning, we specifically design a
classification method with label distance for learning contrastive classes.
CLLD ensures the flexibility within the subtle differences that lead to
different label assignments, and generates the distinct representations for
each class having similarity simultaneously. Extensive experiments on public
benchmarks and internal datasets demonstrate that our method improves the
performance of pre-trained models on classification tasks. Importantly, our
experiments suggest that the learned label distance relieve the adversarial
nature of interclasses.</span>

                    <span>The non-convexity of the artificial neural network (ANN) training landscape
brings inherent optimization difficulties. While the traditional
back-propagation stochastic gradient descent (SGD) algorithm and its variants
are effective in certain cases, they can become stuck at spurious local minima
and are sensitive to initializations and hyperparameters. Recent work has shown
that the training of an ANN with ReLU activations can be reformulated as a
convex program, bringing hope to globally optimizing interpretable ANNs.
However, naively solving the convex training formulation has an exponential
complexity, and even an approximation heuristic requires cubic time. In this
work, we characterize the quality of this approximation and develop two
efficient algorithms that train ANNs with global convergence guarantees. The
first algorithm is based on the alternating direction method of multiplier
(ADMM). It solves both the exact convex formulation and the approximate
counterpart. Linear global convergence is achieved, and the initial several
iterations often yield a solution with high prediction accuracy. When solving
the approximate formulation, the per-iteration time complexity is quadratic.
The second algorithm, based on the &quot;sampled convex programs&quot; theory, is simpler
to implement. It solves unconstrained convex formulations and converges to an
approximately globally optimal classifier. The non-convexity of the ANN
training landscape exacerbates when adversarial training is considered. We
apply the robust convex optimization theory to convex training and develop
convex formulations that train ANNs robust to adversarial inputs. Our analysis
explicitly focuses on one-hidden-layer fully connected ANNs, but can extend to
more sophisticated architectures.</span>

                    <span>What is learning? 20$^{st}$ century formalizations of learning theory --
which precipitated revolutions in artificial intelligence -- focus primarily on
$\mathit{in-distribution}$ learning, that is, learning under the assumption
that the training data are sampled from the same distribution as the evaluation
distribution. This assumption renders these theories inadequate for
characterizing 21$^{st}$ century real world data problems, which are typically
characterized by evaluation distributions that differ from the training data
distributions (referred to as out-of-distribution learning). We therefore make
a small change to existing formal definitions of learnability by relaxing that
assumption. We then introduce $\mathbf{learning\ efficiency}$ (LE) to quantify
the amount a learner is able to leverage data for a given problem, regardless
of whether it is an in- or out-of-distribution problem. We then define and
prove the relationship between generalized notions of learnability, and show
how this framework is sufficiently general to characterize transfer, multitask,
meta, continual, and lifelong learning. We hope this unification helps bridge
the gap between empirical practice and theoretical guidance in real world
problems. Finally, because biological learning continues to outperform machine
learning algorithms on certain OOD challenges, we discuss the limitations of
this framework vis-\&#x27;a-vis its ability to formalize biological learning,
suggesting multiple avenues for future research.</span>

                    <span>Spectral clustering has been one of the widely used methods for community
detection in networks. However, large-scale networks bring computational
challenges to the eigenvalue decomposition therein. In this paper, we study the
spectral clustering using randomized sketching algorithms from a statistical
perspective, where we typically assume the network data are generated from a
stochastic block model that is not necessarily of full rank. To do this, we
first use the recently developed sketching algorithms to obtain two randomized
spectral clustering algorithms, namely, the random projection-based and the
random sampling-based spectral clustering. Then we study the theoretical bounds
of the resulting algorithms in terms of the approximation error for the
population adjacency matrix, the misclassification error, and the estimation
error for the link probability matrix. It turns out that, under mild
conditions, the randomized spectral clustering algorithms lead to the same
theoretical bounds as those of the original spectral clustering algorithm. We
also extend the results to degree-corrected stochastic block models. Numerical
experiments support our theoretical findings and show the efficiency of
randomized methods. A new R package called Rclust is developed and made
available to the public.</span>

mean under an individualized treatment rule. We assume a non-parametric causal
graphical model with, possibly, hidden variables and at least one adjustment
set comprised of observable variables. Moreover, we assume that observable
variables have positive costs associated with them. We define the cost of an
observable adjustment set as the sum of the costs of the variables that
comprise it. We show that in this setting there exist adjustment sets that are
minimum cost optimal, in the sense that they yield non-parametric estimators of
the interventional mean with the smallest asymptotic variance among those that
control for observable adjustment sets that have minimum cost. Our results are
based on the construction of a special flow network associated with the
original causal graph. We show that a minimum cost optimal adjustment set can
be found by computing a maximum flow on the network, and then finding the set
of vertices that are reachable from the source by augmenting paths. The
optimaladj Python package implements the algorithms introduced in this paper.</span>

adaptation for semantic segmentation, wherein a source model must adapt itself
to a new target domain given only unlabeled target data. We propose
Augmentation Consistency-guided Self-training (AUGCO), a source-free adaptation
algorithm that uses the model&#x27;s pixel-level predictive consistency across
diverse, automatically generated views of each target image along with model
confidence to identify reliable pixel predictions, and selectively self-trains
on those. AUGCO achieves state-of-the-art results for source-free adaptation on

hold binary opinions and repeatedly update their beliefs based on others they

disseminated through the network, which is modelled by a connected graph.
Building on earlier results, we provide a closed-form expression for the
average opinion of the group at equilibrium. This leads us to a strategy to
inject zealots into a polarised network in order to shift the average opinion
towards any target value. We account for the possible presence of a backfire

                    <span>Autoencoders are the simplest neural network for unsupervised learning, and
thus an ideal framework for studying feature learning. While a detailed
understanding of the dynamics of linear autoencoders has recently been
obtained, the study of non-linear autoencoders has been hindered by the
technical difficulty of handling training data with non-trivial correlations -
a fundamental prerequisite for feature extraction. Here, we study the dynamics
of feature learning in non-linear, shallow autoencoders. We derive a set of
asymptotically exact equations that describe the generalisation dynamics of
autoencoders trained with stochastic gradient descent (SGD) in the limit of
high-dimensional inputs. These equations reveal that autoencoders learn the
leading principal components of their inputs sequentially. An analysis of the
long-time dynamics explains the failure of sigmoidal autoencoders to learn with
tied weights, and highlights the importance of training the bias in ReLU
autoencoders. Building on previous results for linear networks, we analyse a
modification of the vanilla SGD algorithm which allows learning of the exact
principal components. Finally, we show that our equations accurately describe
the generalisation dynamics of non-linear autoencoders on realistic datasets
such as CIFAR10.</span>

                    <span>Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) aims to transfer and adapt knowledge
from a labeled source domain to an unlabeled target domain. Traditionally,
subspace-based methods form an important class of solutions to this problem.
Despite their mathematical elegance and tractability, these methods are often
found to be ineffective at producing domain-invariant features with complex,
real-world datasets. Motivated by the recent advances in representation
learning with deep networks, this paper revisits the use of subspace alignment
for UDA and proposes a novel adaptation algorithm that consistently leads to
improved generalization. In contrast to existing adversarial training-based DA
methods, our approach isolates feature learning and distribution alignment
steps, and utilizes a primary-auxiliary optimization strategy to effectively
balance the objectives of domain invariance and model fidelity. While providing
a significant reduction in target data and computational requirements, our
subspace-based DA performs competitively and sometimes even outperforms
state-of-the-art approaches on several standard UDA benchmarks. Furthermore,
subspace alignment leads to intrinsically well-regularized models that
demonstrate strong generalization even in the challenging partial DA setting.
Finally, the design of our UDA framework inherently supports progressive
adaptation to new target domains at test-time, without requiring retraining of
the model from scratch. In summary, powered by powerful feature learners and an
effective optimization strategy, we establish subspace-based DA as a highly
effective approach for visual recognition.</span>

otherwise intractable. We consider an agent who is designed to attain a low
information ratio with respect to a bandit environment with a Gaussian prior
distribution and a Gaussian likelihood function, but study the agent&#x27;s
performance when applied instead to a Bernoulli bandit. We establish a bound on
the increase in Bayesian regret when an agent interacts with the Bernoulli
bandit, relative to an information-theoretic bound satisfied with the Gaussian
bandit. If the Gaussian prior distribution and likelihood function are
sufficiently diffuse, this increase grows with the square-root of the time
horizon, and thus the per-timestep increase vanishes. Our results formalize the
folklore that so-called Bayesian agents remain effective when instantiated with
diffuse misspecified distributions.</span>

                    <span>Automated scoring of free drawings or images as responses has yet to be
utilized in large-scale assessments of student achievement. In this study, we
propose artificial neural networks to classify these types of graphical
responses from a computer based international mathematics and science
assessment. We are comparing classification accuracy of convolutional and
feedforward approaches. Our results show that convolutional neural networks
(CNNs) outperform feedforward neural networks in both loss and accuracy. The
CNN models classified up to 97.71% of the image responses into the appropriate
scoring category, which is comparable to, if not more accurate, than typical
human raters. These findings were further strengthened by the observation that
the most accurate CNN models correctly classified some image responses that had
been incorrectly scored by the human raters. As an additional innovation, we
outline a method to select human rated responses for the training sample based
on an application of the expected response function derived from item response
theory. This paper argues that CNN-based automated scoring of image responses
is a highly accurate procedure that could potentially replace the workload and
cost of second human raters for large scale assessments, while improving the
validity and comparability of scoring complex constructed-response items.</span>

individual agents not only to cooperate effectively, but to decide with whom to
cooperate. This is particularly critical in situations when other agents have
hidden, possibly misaligned motivations and goals. Social deduction games offer
an avenue to study how individuals might learn to synthesize potentially
unreliable information about others, and elucidate their true motivations. In
this work, we present Hidden Agenda, a two-team social deduction game that
provides a 2D environment for studying learning agents in scenarios of unknown

                    <span>Implicit neural networks have been successfully used for surface
reconstruction from point clouds. However, many of them face scalability issues
as they encode the isosurface function of a whole object or scene into a single
latent vector. To overcome this limitation, a few approaches infer latent
vectors on a coarse regular 3D grid or on 3D patches, and interpolate them to
answer occupancy queries. In doing so, they loose the direct connection with
the input points sampled on the surface of objects, and they attach information
uniformly in space rather than where it matters the most, i.e., near the
surface. Besides, relying on fixed patch sizes may require discretization
tuning. To address these issues, we propose to use point cloud convolutions and
compute latent vectors at each input point. We then perform a learning-based
interpolation on nearest neighbors using inferred weights. Experiments on both
object and scene datasets show that our approach significantly outperforms
other methods on most classical metrics, producing finer details and better
reconstructing thinner volumes. The code is available at

                    <span>The problem of selecting optimal backdoor adjustment sets to estimate causal
effects in graphical models with hidden and conditioned variables is addressed.
Previous work has defined optimality as achieving the smallest asymptotic
estimation variance and derived an optimal set for the case without hidden
variables. For the case with hidden variables there can be settings where no
optimal set exists and currently only a sufficient graphical optimality
criterion of limited applicability has been derived. In the present work
optimality is characterized as maximizing a certain adjustment information
which allows to derive a necessary and sufficient graphical criterion for the
existence of an optimal adjustment set and a definition and algorithm to
construct it. Further, the optimal set is valid if and only if a valid
adjustment set exists and has higher (or equal) adjustment information than the
Adjust-set proposed in Perkovi{\&#x27;c} et al. [Journal of Machine Learning
Research, 18: 1--62, 2018] for any graph. The results translate to minimal
asymptotic estimation variance for a class of estimators whose asymptotic
variance follows a certain information-theoretic relation. Numerical
experiments indicate that the asymptotic results also hold for relatively small
sample sizes and that the optimal adjustment set or minimized variants thereof
often yield better variance also beyond that estimator class. Surprisingly,
among the randomly created setups more than 90\% fulfill the optimality
conditions indicating that also in many real-world scenarios graphical
optimality may hold. Code is available as part of the python package

                    <span>This paper explores a better codebook for BERT pre-training of vision
transformers. The recent work BEiT successfully transfers BERT pre-training
from NLP to the vision field. It directly adopts one simple discrete VAE as the
visual tokenizer, but has not considered the semantic level of the resulting
visual tokens. By contrast, the discrete tokens in NLP field are naturally
highly semantic. This difference motivates us to learn a perceptual codebook.
And we surprisingly find one simple yet effective idea: enforcing perceptual
similarity during the dVAE training. We demonstrate that the visual tokens
generated by the proposed perceptual codebook do exhibit better semantic
meanings, and subsequently help pre-training achieve superior transfer
performance in various downstream tasks. For example, we achieve 84.5% Top-1
accuracy on ImageNet-1K with ViT-B backbone, outperforming the competitive
method BEiT by +1.3 with the same pre-training epochs. It can also improve the
performance of object detection and segmentation tasks on COCO val by +1.3 box
AP and +1.0 mask AP, semantic segmentation on ADE20k by +1.0 mIoU. Equipped
with a larger backbone ViT-H, we achieve the state-of-the-art performance
(88.3% Top-1 accuracy) among the methods using only ImageNet-1K data. The code

                    <span>In recent years, large pre-trained deep neural networks (DNNs) have
revolutionized the field of computer vision (CV). Although these DNNs have been
shown to be very well suited for general image recognition tasks, application
in industry is often precluded for three reasons: 1) large pre-trained DNNs are
built on hundreds of millions of parameters, making deployment on many devices
impossible, 2) the underlying dataset for pre-training consists of general
objects, while industrial cases often consist of very specific objects, such as
structures on solar wafers, 3) potentially biased pre-trained DNNs raise legal
issues for companies. As a remedy, we study neural networks for CV that we
train from scratch. For this purpose, we use a real-world case from a solar
wafer manufacturer. We find that our neural networks achieve similar
performances as pre-trained DNNs, even though they consist of far fewer
parameters and do not rely on third-party datasets.</span>

                    <span>Estimating value functions is a core component of reinforcement learning
algorithms. Temporal difference (TD) learning algorithms use bootstrapping,
i.e. they update the value function toward a learning target using value
estimates at subsequent time-steps. Alternatively, the value function can be
updated toward a learning target constructed by separately predicting successor
features (SF)--a policy-dependent model--and linearly combining them with
instantaneous rewards. We focus on bootstrapping targets used when estimating
value functions, and propose a new backup target, the $\eta$-return mixture,
which implicitly combines value-predictive knowledge (used by TD methods) with
(successor) feature-predictive knowledge--with a parameter $\eta$ capturing how
much to rely on each. We illustrate that incorporating predictive knowledge
through an $\eta\gamma$-discounted SF model makes more efficient use of sampled
experience, compared to either extreme, i.e. bootstrapping entirely on the
value function estimate, or bootstrapping on the product of separately
estimated successor features and instantaneous reward models. We empirically
show this approach leads to faster policy evaluation and better control
performance, for tabular and nonlinear function approximations, indicating
scalability and generality.</span>

                    <span>We study the online influence maximization (OIM) problem in social networks,
where in multiple rounds the learner repeatedly chooses seed nodes to generate
cascades, observes the cascade feedback, and gradually learns the best seeds
that generate the largest cascade. We focus on two major challenges in this
paper. First, we work with node-level feedback instead of edge-level feedback.
The edge-level feedback reveals all edges that pass through information in a
cascade, where the node-level feedback only reveals the activated nodes with
timestamps. The node-level feedback is arguably more realistic since in
practice it is relatively easy to observe who is influenced but very difficult
to observe from which relationship (edge) the influence comes from. Second, we
use standard offline oracle instead of offline pair-oracle. To compute a good
seed set for the next round, an offline pair-oracle finds the best seed set and
the best parameters within the confidence region simultaneously, and such an
oracle is difficult to compute due to the combinatorial core of OIM problem. So
we focus on how to use the standard offline influence maximization oracle which
finds the best seed set given the edge parameters as input. In this paper, we
resolve these challenges for the two most popular diffusion models, the
independent cascade (IC) and the linear threshold (LT) model. For the IC model,
the past research only achieves edge-level feedback, while we present the first
$\widetilde{O}(\sqrt{T})$-regret algorithm for the node-level feedback.
Besides, the algorithm only invokes standard offline oracles. For the LT model,
a recent study only provides an OIM solution that meets the first challenge but
still requires a pair-oracle. In this paper, we apply a similar technique as in
the IC model to replace the pair-oracle with a standard oracle while
maintaining $\widetilde{O}(\sqrt{T})$-regret.</span>

                    <span>The Resource Description Framework (RDF) is a framework for describing
metadata, such as attributes and relationships of resources on the Web. Machine
learning tasks for RDF graphs adopt three methods: (i) support vector machines
(SVMs) with RDF graph kernels, (ii) RDF graph embeddings, and (iii) relational
graph convolutional networks. In this paper, we propose a novel feature vector
(called a Skip vector) that represents some features of each resource in an RDF
graph by extracting various combinations of neighboring edges and nodes. In
order to make the Skip vector low-dimensional, we select important features for
classification tasks based on the information gain ratio of each feature. The
classification tasks can be performed by applying the low-dimensional Skip
vector of each resource to conventional machine learning algorithms, such as
SVMs, the k-nearest neighbors method, neural networks, random forests, and
AdaBoost. In our evaluation experiments with RDF data, such as Wikidata,
DBpedia, and YAGO, we compare our method with RDF graph kernels in an SVM. We
also compare our method with the two approaches: RDF graph embeddings such as
RDF2vec and relational graph convolutional networks on the AIFB, MUTAG, BGS,

community. Analysing the sentiments and opinions of the common public is very

behind the activeness of many media agencies during the election time for
performing various kinds of opinion polls. In this paper, we have worked
towards analysing the sentiments of the people of India during the Lok Sabha

unsupervised nature of this problem. We have used the Linear Support Vector

                    <span>A deep learning-based model reduction (DeePMR) method for simplifying
chemical kinetics is proposed and validated using high-temperature
auto-ignitions, perfectly stirred reactors (PSR), and one-dimensional freely
propagating flames of n-heptane/air mixtures. The mechanism reduction is
modeled as an optimization problem on Boolean space, where a Boolean vector,
each entry corresponding to a species, represents a reduced mechanism. The
optimization goal is to minimize the reduced mechanism size given the error
tolerance of a group of pre-selected benchmark quantities. The key idea of the
DeePMR is to employ a deep neural network (DNN) to formulate the objective
function in the optimization problem. In order to explore high dimensional
Boolean space efficiently, an iterative DNN-assisted data sampling and DNN
training procedure are implemented. The results show that DNN-assistance
improves sampling efficiency significantly, selecting only $10^5$ samples out
of $10^{34}$ possible samples for DNN to achieve sufficient accuracy. The
results demonstrate the capability of the DNN to recognize key species and
reasonably predict reduced mechanism performance. The well-trained DNN
guarantees the optimal reduced mechanism by solving an inverse optimization
problem. By comparing ignition delay times, laminar flame speeds, temperatures
in PSRs, the resulting skeletal mechanism has fewer species (45 species) but
the same level of accuracy as the skeletal mechanism (56 species) obtained by
the Path Flux Analysis (PFA) method. In addition, the skeletal mechanism can be
further reduced to 28 species if only considering atmospheric,
near-stoichiometric conditions (equivalence ratio between 0.6 and 1.2). The
DeePMR provides an innovative way to perform model reduction and demonstrates

                    <span>On the long-established classification problems in general relativity we take
a novel perspective by adopting fruitful techniques from machine learning and
modern data-science. In particular, we model Petrov&#x27;s classification of
spacetimes, and show that a feed-forward neural network can achieve high degree
of success. We also show how data visualization techniques with dimensionality
reduction can help analyze the underlying patterns in the structure of the

                    <span>The paper describes the use of Bayesian regression for building time series
models and stacking different predictive models for time series. Using Bayesian
regression for time series modeling with nonlinear trend was analyzed. This
approach makes it possible to estimate an uncertainty of time series prediction
and calculate value at risk characteristics. A hierarchical model for time
series using Bayesian regression has been considered. In this approach, one set
of parameters is the same for all data samples, other parameters can be
different for different groups of data samples. Such an approach allows using
this model in the case of short historical data for specified time series, e.g.
in the case of new stores or new products in the sales prediction problem. In
the study of predictive models stacking, the models ARIMA, Neural Network,
Random Forest, Extra Tree were used for the prediction on the first level of
model ensemble. On the second level, time series predictions of these models on
the validation set were used for stacking by Bayesian regression. This approach
gives distributions for regression coefficients of these models. It makes it
possible to estimate the uncertainty contributed by each model to stacking
result. The information about these distributions allows us to select an
optimal set of stacking models, taking into account the domain knowledge. The
probabilistic approach for stacking predictive models allows us to make risk
assessment for the predictions that are important in a decision-making process.</span>

                    <span>Traditional recommender systems aim to estimate a user&#x27;s rating to an item
based on observed ratings from the population. As with all observational
studies, hidden confounders, which are factors that affect both item exposures
and user ratings, lead to a systematic bias in the estimation. Consequently, a
new trend in recommender system research is to negate the influence of
confounders from a causal perspective. Observing that confounders in
recommendations are usually shared among items and are therefore multi-cause
confounders, we model the recommendation as a multi-cause multi-outcome (MCMO)
inference problem. Specifically, to remedy confounding bias, we estimate
user-specific latent variables that render the item exposures independent
Bernoulli trials. The generative distribution is parameterized by a DNN with
factorized logistic likelihood and the intractable posteriors are estimated by
variational inference. Controlling these factors as substitute confounders,
under mild assumptions, can eliminate the bias incurred by multi-cause
confounders. Furthermore, we show that MCMO modeling may lead to high variance
due to scarce observations associated with the high-dimensional causal space.
Fortunately, we theoretically demonstrate that introducing user features as
pre-treatment variables can substantially improve sample efficiency and
alleviate overfitting. Empirical studies on simulated and real-world datasets
show that the proposed deep causal recommender shows more robustness to
unobserved confounders than state-of-the-art causal recommenders. Codes and
datasets are released at https://github.com/yaochenzhu/deep-deconf.</span>

                    <span>Machine learning can be enhanced through the integration of external
knowledge. This method, called knowledge informed machine learning, is also
applicable within the field of Prognostics and Health Management (PHM). In this
paper, the various methods of knowledge informed machine learning, from a PHM
context, are reviewed with the goal of helping the reader understand the
domain. In addition, a knowledge informed machine learning technique is
demonstrated, using the common IMS and PRONOSTIA bearing data sets, for
remaining useful life (RUL) prediction. Specifically, knowledge is garnered
from the field of reliability engineering which is represented through the
Weibull distribution. The knowledge is then integrated into a neural network
through a novel Weibull-based loss function. A thorough statistical analysis of
the Weibull-based loss function is conducted, demonstrating the effectiveness
of the method on the PRONOSTIA data set. However, the Weibull-based loss
function is less effective on the IMS data set. The results, shortcomings, and
benefits of the approach are discussed in length. Finally, all the code is
publicly available for the benefit of other researchers.</span>

                    <span>The article describes the use of deep Q-learning models in the problems of
sales time series analytics. In contrast to supervised machine learning which
is a kind of passive learning using historical data, Q-learning is a kind of
active learning with goal to maximize a reward by optimal sequence of actions.
Model free Q-learning approach for optimal pricing strategies and supply-demand
problems was considered in the work. The main idea of the study is to show that
using deep Q-learning approach in time series analytics, the sequence of
actions can be optimized by maximizing the reward function when the environment
for learning agent interaction can be modeled using the parametric model and in
the case of using the model which is based on the historical data. In the
pricing optimizing case study environment was modeled using sales dependence on
extras price and randomly simulated demand. In the pricing optimizing case
study, the environment was modeled using sales dependence on extra price and
randomly simulated demand. In the supply-demand case study, it was proposed to
use historical demand time series for environment modeling, agent states were
represented by promo actions, previous demand values and weekly seasonality
features. Obtained results show that using deep Q-learning, we can optimize the
decision making process for price optimization and supply-demand problems.
Environment modeling using parametric models and historical data can be used
for the cold start of learning agent. On the next steps, after the cold start,
the trained agent can be used in real business environment.</span>

                    <span>The problem of linear predictions has been extensively studied for the past
century under pretty generalized frameworks. Recent advances in the robust
statistics literature allow us to analyze robust versions of classical linear
models through the prism of Median of Means (MoM). Combining these approaches
in a piecemeal way might lead to ad-hoc procedures, and the restricted
theoretical conclusions that underpin each individual contribution may no
longer be valid. To meet these challenges coherently, in this study, we offer a
unified robust framework that includes a broad variety of linear prediction
problems on a Hilbert space, coupled with a generic class of loss functions.
Notably, we do not require any assumptions on the distribution of the outlying
data points ($\mathcal{O}$) nor the compactness of the support of the inlying
ones ($\mathcal{I}$). Under mild conditions on the dual norm, we show that for
misspecification level $\epsilon$, these estimators achieve an error rate of
$O(\max\left\{|\mathcal{O}|^{1/2}n^{-1/2}, |\mathcal{I}|^{1/2}n^{-1}
\right\}+\epsilon)$, matching the best-known rates in literature. This rate is
slightly slower than the classical rates of $O(n^{-1/2})$, indicating that we
need to pay a price in terms of error rates to obtain robust estimates.
Additionally, we show that this rate can be improved to achieve so-called
&#x60;&#x60;fast rates&quot; under additional assumptions.</span>

target circuit component values and target topologies, our proposed approach
achieves the direct synthesis of the passive network given the network topology
from desired performance values as input. We showcase the proposed synthesis
Neural Network (NN) model on an on-chip 1:1 transformer-based impedance
matching network. By leveraging parameter sharing, the synthesis NN model
successfully extracts relevant features from the input impedance and load
capacitors, and predict the transformer 3D EM geometry in a 45nm SOI process
that will match the standard 50$\Omega$ load to the target input impedance
while absorbing the two loading capacitors. As a proof-of-concept, several
example transformer geometries were synthesized, and verified in Ansys HFSS to
provide the desired input impedance.</span>

trials, through the use of covariates correlated with the outcome but
independent of the treatment. We propose a machine learning regression-adjusted
treatment effect estimator, which we call MLRATE. MLRATE uses machine learning
predictors of the outcome to reduce estimator variance. It employs
cross-fitting to avoid overfitting biases, and we prove consistency and
asymptotic normality under general conditions. MLRATE is robust to poor
predictions from the machine learning step: if the predictions are uncorrelated
with the outcomes, the estimator performs asymptotically no worse than the
standard difference-in-means estimator, while if predictions are highly
correlated with outcomes, the efficiency gains are large. In A/A tests, for a
set of 48 outcome metrics commonly monitored in Facebook experiments the
estimator has over 70% lower variance than the simple difference-in-means
estimator, and about 19% lower variance than the common univariate procedure
which adjusts only for pre-experiment values of the outcome.</span>

                    <span>Exploiting sparsity is a key technique in accelerating quantized
convolutional neural network (CNN) inference on mobile devices. Prior sparse
CNN accelerators largely exploit un-structured sparsity and achieve significant
speedups. Due to the unbounded, largely unpredictable sparsity patterns,
however, exploiting unstructured sparsity requires complicated hardware design
with significant energy and area overhead, which is particularly detrimental to
mobile/IoT inference scenarios where energy and area efficiency are crucial. We
propose to exploit structured sparsity, more specifically, Density Bound Block
(DBB) sparsity for both weights and activations. DBB block tensors bound the
maximum number of non-zeros per block. DBB thus exposes statically predictable
sparsity patterns that enable lean sparsity-exploiting hardware. We propose new
hardware primitives to implement DBB sparsity for (static) weights and
(dynamic) activations, respectively, with very low overheads. Building on top
of the primitives, we describe S2TA, a systolic array-based CNN accelerator
that exploits joint weight and activation DBB sparsity and new dimensions of
data reuse unavailable on the traditional systolic array. S2TA in 16nm achieves
more than 2x speedup and energy reduction compared to a strong baseline of a
systolic array with zero-value clock gating, over five popular CNN benchmarks.
Compared to two recent non-systolic sparse accelerators, Eyeriss v2 (65nm) and
SparTen (45nm), S2TA in 65nm uses about 2.2x and 3.1x less energy per
inference, respectively.</span>

                    <span>In this work, we study empirical risk minimization (ERM) within a federated
learning framework, where a central server minimizes an ERM objective function
using training data that is stored across $m$ clients. In this setting, the
Federated Averaging (FedAve) algorithm is the staple for determining
$\epsilon$-approximate solutions to the ERM problem. Similar to standard
optimization algorithms, the convergence analysis of FedAve only relies on
smoothness of the loss function in the optimization parameter. However, loss
functions are often very smooth in the training data too. To exploit this
additional smoothness, we propose the Federated Low Rank Gradient Descent
(FedLRGD) algorithm. Since smoothness in data induces an approximate low rank
structure on the loss function, our method first performs a few rounds of
communication between the server and clients to learn weights that the server
can use to approximate clients&#x27; gradients. Then, our method solves the ERM
problem at the server using inexact gradient descent. To show that FedLRGD can
have superior performance to FedAve, we present a notion of federated oracle
complexity as a counterpart to canonical oracle complexity. Under some
assumptions on the loss function, e.g., strong convexity in parameter,
$\eta$-H\&quot;older smoothness in data, etc., we prove that the federated oracle
complexity of FedLRGD scales like $\phi m(p/\epsilon)^{\Theta(d/\eta)}$ and
that of FedAve scales like $\phi m(p/\epsilon)^{3/4}$ (neglecting sub-dominant
factors), where $\phi\gg 1$ is a &quot;communication-to-computation ratio,&quot; $p$ is
the parameter dimension, and $d$ is the data dimension. Then, we show that when
$d$ is small and the loss function is sufficiently smooth in the data, FedLRGD
beats FedAve in federated oracle complexity. Finally, in the course of
analyzing FedLRGD, we also establish a result on low rank approximation of
latent variable models.</span>

                    <span>We consider reinforcement learning (RL) in Markov Decision Processes in which
an agent repeatedly interacts with an environment that is modeled by a
controlled Markov process. At each time step $t$, it earns a reward, and also
incurs a cost-vector consisting of $M$ costs. We design model-based RL
algorithms that maximize the cumulative reward earned over a time horizon of
$T$ time-steps, while simultaneously ensuring that the average values of the
$M$ cost expenditures are bounded by agent-specified thresholds
$c^{ub}_i,i&#x3D;1,2,\ldots,M$.

In order to measure the performance of a reinforcement learning algorithm
that satisfies the average cost constraints, we define an $M+1$ dimensional
regret vector that is composed of its reward regret, and $M$ cost regrets. The
reward regret measures the sub-optimality in the cumulative reward, while the
$i$-th component of the cost regret vector is the difference between its $i$-th
cumulative cost expense and the expected cost expenditures $Tc^{ub}_i$.

We prove that the expected value of the regret vector of UCRL-CMDP, is
upper-bounded as $\tilde{O}\left(T^{2\slash 3}\right)$, where $T$ is the time
horizon. We further show how to reduce the regret of a desired subset of the
$M$ costs, at the expense of increasing the regrets of rewards and the
remaining costs. To the best of our knowledge, ours is the only work that
considers non-episodic RL under average cost constraints, and derive algorithms
that can~\emph{tune the regret vector} according to the agent&#x27;s requirements on
its cost regrets.</span>

                    <span>We present Contrastive Neighborhood Alignment (CNA), a manifold learning
approach to maintain the topology of learned features whereby data points that
are mapped to nearby representations by the source (teacher) model are also
mapped to neighbors by the target (student) model. The target model aims to
mimic the local structure of the source representation space using a
contrastive loss. CNA is an unsupervised learning algorithm that does not
require ground-truth labels for the individual samples. CNA is illustrated in
three scenarios: manifold learning, where the model maintains the local
topology of the original data in a dimension-reduced space; model distillation,
where a small student model is trained to mimic a larger teacher; and legacy
model update, where an older model is replaced by a more powerful one.
Experiments show that CNA is able to capture the manifold in a high-dimensional
space and improves performance compared to the competing methods in their
domains.</span>

                    <span>Differentiable solvers for the linear assignment problem (LAP) have attracted
much research attention in recent years, which are usually embedded into
learning frameworks as components. However, previous algorithms, with or
without learning strategies, usually suffer from the degradation of the
optimality with the increment of the problem size. In this paper, we propose a
learnable linear assignment solver based on deep graph networks. Specifically,
we first transform the cost matrix to a bipartite graph and convert the
assignment task to the problem of selecting reliable edges from the constructed
graph. Subsequently, a deep graph network is developed to aggregate and update
the features of nodes and edges. Finally, the network predicts a label for each
edge that indicates the assignment relationship. The experimental results on a
synthetic dataset reveal that our method outperforms state-of-the-art baselines
and achieves consistently high accuracy with the increment of the problem size.
Furthermore, we also embed the proposed solver, in comparison with
state-of-the-art baseline solvers, into a popular multi-object tracking (MOT)
framework to train the tracker in an end-to-end manner. The experimental
results on MOT benchmarks illustrate that the proposed LAP solver improves the
tracker by the largest margin.</span>

                    <span>Graph-based Anomaly Detection (GAD) is becoming prevalent due to the powerful
representation abilities of graphs as well as recent advances in graph mining
techniques. These GAD tools, however, expose a new attacking surface,
ironically due to their unique advantage of being able to exploit the relations
among data. That is, attackers now can manipulate those relations (i.e., the
structure of the graph) to allow some target nodes to evade detection. In this
paper, we exploit this vulnerability by designing a new type of targeted
structural poisoning attacks to a representative regression-based GAD system
termed OddBall. Specially, we formulate the attack against OddBall as a
bi-level optimization problem, where the key technical challenge is to
efficiently solve the problem in a discrete domain. We propose a novel attack
method termed BinarizedAttack based on gradient descent. Comparing to prior
arts, BinarizedAttack can better use the gradient information, making it
particularly suitable for solving combinatorial optimization problems.
Furthermore, we investigate the attack transferability of BinarizedAttack by
employing it to attack other representation-learning-based GAD systems. Our
comprehensive experiments demonstrate that BinarizedAttack is very effective in
enabling target nodes to evade graph-based anomaly detection tools with limited
attackers&#x27; budget, and in the black-box transfer attack setting,
BinarizedAttack is also tested effective and in particular, can significantly
change the node embeddings learned by the GAD systems. Our research thus opens
the door to studying a new type of attack against security analytic tools that
rely on graph data.</span>

                    <span>In this paper we propose to study generalization of neural networks on small
algorithmically generated datasets. In this setting, questions about data
efficiency, memorization, generalization, and speed of learning can be studied
in great detail. In some situations we show that neural networks learn through
a process of &quot;grokking&quot; a pattern in the data, improving generalization
performance from random chance level to perfect generalization, and that this
improvement in generalization can happen well past the point of overfitting. We
also study generalization as a function of dataset size and find that smaller
datasets require increasing amounts of optimization for generalization. We
argue that these datasets provide a fertile ground for studying a poorly
understood aspect of deep learning: generalization of overparametrized neural
networks beyond memorization of the finite training dataset.</span>

                    <span>We consider the joint design and control of discrete-time stochastic
dynamical systems over a finite time horizon. We formulate the problem as a
multi-step optimization problem under uncertainty seeking to identify a system
design and a control policy that jointly maximize the expected sum of rewards
collected over the time horizon considered. The transition function, the reward
function and the policy are all parametrized, assumed known and differentiable
with respect to their parameters. We then introduce a deep reinforcement
learning algorithm combining policy gradient methods with model-based
optimization techniques to solve this problem. In essence, our algorithm
iteratively approximates the gradient of the expected return via Monte-Carlo
sampling and automatic differentiation and takes projected gradient ascent
steps in the space of environment and policy parameters. This algorithm is
referred to as Direct Environment and Policy Search (DEPS). We assess the
performance of our algorithm in three environments concerned with the design
and control of a mass-spring-damper system, a small-scale off-grid power system
and a drone, respectively. In addition, our algorithm is benchmarked against a
state-of-the-art deep reinforcement learning algorithm used to tackle joint
design and control problems. We show that DEPS performs at least as well or
better in all three environments, consistently yielding solutions with higher
returns in fewer iterations. Finally, solutions produced by our algorithm are
also compared with solutions produced by an algorithm that does not jointly
optimize environment and policy parameters, highlighting the fact that higher
returns can be achieved when joint optimization is performed.</span>

                    <span>This work studies the question of Representation Learning in RL: how can we
learn a compact low-dimensional representation such that on top of the
representation we can perform RL procedures such as exploration and
exploitation, in a sample efficient manner. We focus on the low-rank Markov
Decision Processes (MDPs) where the transition dynamics correspond to a
low-rank transition matrix. Unlike prior works that assume the representation
is known (e.g., linear MDPs), here we need to learn the representation for the
low-rank MDP. We study both the online RL and offline RL settings. For the
online setting, operating with the same computational oracles used in FLAMBE
(Agarwal et.al), the state-of-art algorithm for learning representations in
low-rank MDPs, we propose an algorithm REP-UCB Upper Confidence Bound driven
Representation learning for RL), which significantly improves the sample
complexity from $\widetilde{O}( A^9 d^7 / (\epsilon^{10} (1-\gamma)^{22}))$ for
FLAMBE to $\widetilde{O}( A^2 d^4 / (\epsilon^2 (1-\gamma)^{5}) )$ with $d$
being the rank of the transition matrix (or dimension of the ground truth
representation), $A$ being the number of actions, and $\gamma$ being the
discounted factor. Notably, REP-UCB is simpler than FLAMBE, as it directly
balances the interplay between representation learning, exploration, and
exploitation, while FLAMBE is an explore-then-commit style approach and has to
perform reward-free exploration step-by-step forward in time. For the offline
RL setting, we develop an algorithm that leverages pessimism to learn under a
partial coverage condition: our algorithm is able to compete against any policy
as long as it is covered by the offline distribution.</span>

                    <span>Online Tensor Factorization (OTF) is a fundamental tool in learning
low-dimensional interpretable features from streaming multi-modal data. While
various algorithmic and theoretical aspects of OTF have been investigated
recently, a general convergence guarantee to stationary points of the objective
function without any incoherence or sparsity assumptions is still lacking even
for the i.i.d. case. In this work, we introduce a novel algorithm that learns a
CANDECOMP/PARAFAC (CP) basis from a given stream of tensor-valued data under
general constraints, including nonnegativity constraints that induce
interpretability of the learned CP basis. We prove that our algorithm converges
almost surely to the set of stationary points of the objective function under
the hypothesis that the sequence of data tensors is generated by an underlying
Markov chain. Our setting covers the classical i.i.d. case as well as a wide
range of application contexts including data streams generated by independent
or MCMC sampling. Our result closes a gap between OTF and Online Matrix
Factorization in global convergence analysis \commHL{for CP-decompositions}.
Experimentally, we show that our algorithm converges much faster than standard
algorithms for nonnegative tensor factorization tasks on both synthetic and
real-world data. Also, we demonstrate the utility of our algorithm on a diverse
set of examples from an image, video, and time-series data, illustrating how
one may learn qualitatively different CP-dictionaries from the same tensor data
by exploiting the tensor structure in multiple ways.</span>

                    <span>We derive conditions for the existence of fixed points of nonnegative neural
networks, an important research objective to understand the behavior of neural
networks in modern applications involving autoencoders and loop unrolling
techniques, among others. In particular, we show that neural networks with
nonnegative inputs and nonnegative parameters can be recognized as monotonic
and (weakly) scalable functions within the framework of nonlinear
Perron-Frobenius theory. This fact enables us to derive conditions for the
existence of a nonempty fixed point set of the nonnegative neural networks, and
these conditions are weaker than those obtained recently using arguments in
convex analysis, which are typically based on the assumption of nonexpansivity
of the activation functions. Furthermore, we prove that the shape of the fixed
point set of monotonic and weakly scalable neural networks is often an
interval, which degenerates to a point for the case of scalable networks. The
chief results of this paper are verified in numerical simulations, where we
consider an autoencoder-type network that first compresses angular power
spectra in massive MIMO systems, and, second, reconstruct the input spectra
from the compressed signals.</span>

                    <span>We consider applications involving a large set of instances of projecting
points to polytopes. We develop an intuition guided by theoretical and
empirical analysis to show that when these instances follow certain structures,
a large majority of the projections lie on vertices of the polytopes. To do
these projections efficiently we derive a vertex-oriented incremental algorithm
to project a point onto any arbitrary polytope, as well as give specific
algorithms to cater to simplex projection and polytopes where the unit box is
cut by planes. Such settings are especially useful in web-scale applications
such as optimal matching or allocation problems. Several such problems in
internet marketplaces (e-commerce, ride-sharing, food delivery, professional
services, advertising, etc.), can be formulated as Linear Programs (LP) with
such polytope constraints that require a projection step in the overall
optimization process. We show that in the very recent work, the polytopic
projection is the most expensive step and our efficient projection algorithms
help in gaining massive improvements in performance.</span>

                    <span>The great performance of machine learning algorithms and deep neural networks
in several perception and control tasks is pushing the industry to adopt such
technologies in safety-critical applications, as autonomous robots and
self-driving vehicles. At present, however, several issues need to be solved to
make deep learning methods more trustworthy, predictable, safe, and secure
against adversarial attacks. Although several methods have been proposed to
improve the trustworthiness of deep neural networks, most of them are tailored
for specific classes of adversarial examples, hence failing to detect other
corner cases or unsafe inputs that heavily deviate from the training samples.
This paper presents a lightweight monitoring architecture based on coverage
paradigms to enhance the model robustness against different unsafe inputs. In
particular, four coverage analysis methods are proposed and tested in the
architecture for evaluating multiple detection logics. Experimental results
show that the proposed approach is effective in detecting both powerful
adversarial examples and out-of-distribution inputs, introducing limited
extra-execution time and memory requirements.</span>

                    <span>We study the transfer learning process between two linear regression
problems. An important and timely special case is when the regressors are
overparameterized and perfectly interpolate their training data. We examine a
parameter transfer mechanism whereby a subset of the parameters of the target
task solution are constrained to the values learned for a related source task.
We analytically characterize the generalization error of the target task in
terms of the salient factors in the transfer learning architecture, i.e., the
number of examples available, the number of (free) parameters in each of the
tasks, the number of parameters transferred from the source to target task, and
the relation between the two tasks. Our non-asymptotic analysis shows that the
generalization error of the target task follows a two-dimensional double
descent trend (with respect to the number of free parameters in each of the
tasks) that is controlled by the transfer learning factors. Our analysis points
to specific cases where the transfer of parameters is beneficial as a
substitute for extra overparameterization (i.e., additional free parameters in
the target task). Specifically, we show that the usefulness of a transfer
learning setting is fragile and depends on a delicate interplay among the set
of transferred parameters, the relation between the tasks, and the true
solution. We also demonstrate that overparameterized transfer learning is not
necessarily more beneficial when the source task is closer or identical to the
target task.</span>

                    <span>Data privacy has become an increasingly important issue in Machine Learning
(ML), where many approaches have been developed to tackle this challenge, e.g.
cryptography (Homomorphic Encryption (HE), Differential Privacy (DP), etc.) and
collaborative training (Secure Multi-Party Computation (MPC), Distributed
Learning and Federated Learning (FL)). These techniques have a particular focus
on data encryption or secure local computation. They transfer the intermediate
information to the third party to compute the final result. Gradient exchanging
is commonly considered to be a secure way of training a robust model
collaboratively in Deep Learning (DL). However, recent researches have
demonstrated that sensitive information can be recovered from the shared
gradient. Generative Adversarial Network (GAN), in particular, has shown to be
effective in recovering such information. However, GAN based techniques require
additional information, such as class labels which are generally unavailable
for privacy-preserved learning. In this paper, we show that, in the FL system,
image-based privacy data can be easily recovered in full from the shared
gradient only via our proposed Generative Regression Neural Network (GRNN). We
formulate the attack to be a regression problem and optimize two branches of
the generative model by minimizing the distance between gradients. We evaluate
our method on several image classification tasks. The results illustrate that
our proposed GRNN outperforms state-of-the-art methods with better stability,
stronger robustness, and higher accuracy. It also has no convergence
requirement to the global FL model. Moreover, we demonstrate information
leakage using face re-identification. Some defense strategies are also
discussed in this work.</span>

                    <span>Active inference is a unifying theory for perception and action resting upon
the idea that the brain maintains an internal model of the world by minimizing
free energy. From a behavioral perspective, active inference agents can be seen
as self-evidencing beings that act to fulfill their optimistic predictions,
namely preferred outcomes or goals. In contrast, reinforcement learning
requires human-designed rewards to accomplish any desired outcome. Although
active inference could provide a more natural self-supervised objective for
control, its applicability has been limited because of the shortcomings in
scaling the approach to complex environments. In this work, we propose a
contrastive objective for active inference that strongly reduces the
computational burden in learning the agent&#x27;s generative model and planning
future actions. Our method performs notably better than likelihood-based active
inference in image-based tasks, while also being computationally cheaper and
easier to train. We compare to reinforcement learning agents that have access
to human-designed reward functions, showing that our approach closely matches
their performance. Finally, we also show that contrastive methods perform
significantly better in the case of distractors in the environment and that our
method is able to generalize goals to variations in the background.</span>

                    <span>Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) can be viewed as nonlinear sieves that can
approximate complex functions of high dimensional variables more effectively
than linear sieves. We investigate the computational performance of various
ANNs in nonparametric instrumental variables (NPIV) models of moderately high
dimensional covariates that are relevant to empirical economics. We present two
efficient procedures for estimation and inference on a weighted average
derivative (WAD): an orthogonalized plug-in with optimally-weighted sieve
minimum distance (OP-OSMD) procedure and a sieve efficient score (ES)
procedure. Both estimators for WAD use ANN sieves to approximate the unknown
NPIV function and are root-n asymptotically normal and first-order equivalent.
We provide a detailed practitioner&#x27;s recipe for implementing both efficient
procedures. This involves the choice of tuning parameters for the unknown NPIV,
the conditional expectations and the optimal weighting function that are
present in both procedures but also the choice of tuning parameters for the
unknown Riesz representer in the ES procedure. We compare their finite-sample
performances in various simulation designs that involve smooth NPIV function of
up to 13 continuous covariates, different nonlinearities and covariate
correlations. Some Monte Carlo findings include: 1) tuning and optimization are
more delicate in ANN estimation; 2) given proper tuning, both ANN estimators
with various architectures can perform well; 3) easier to tune ANN OP-OSMD
estimators than ANN ES estimators; 4) stable inferences are more difficult to
achieve with ANN (than spline) estimators; 5) there are gaps between current
implementations and approximation theories. Finally, we apply ANN NPIV to
estimate average partial derivatives in two empirical demand examples with
multivariate covariates.</span>

                    <span>Evaluating the real-world performance of network protocols is challenging.
Randomized control trials (RCT) are expensive and inaccessible to most
researchers, while expert-designed simulators fail to capture complex behaviors
in real networks. We present CausalSim, a data-driven simulator for network
protocols that addresses this challenge. Learning network behavior from
observational data is complicated due to the bias introduced by the protocols
used during data collection. CausalSim uses traces from an initial RCT under a
set of protocols to learn a causal network model, effectively removing the
biases present in the data. Using this model, CausalSim can then simulate any
protocol over the same traces (i.e., for counterfactual predictions). Key to
CausalSim is the novel use of adversarial neural network training that exploits
distributional invariances that are present due to the training data coming
from an RCT. Our extensive evaluation of CausalSim on both real and synthetic
datasets and two use cases, including more than nine months of real data from
the Puffer video streaming system, shows that it provides accurate
counterfactual predictions, reducing prediction error by 44% and 53% on average
compared to expert-designed and standard supervised learning baselines.</span>

                    <span>We study reward design strategies for incentivizing a reinforcement learning
agent to adopt a policy from a set of admissible policies. The goal of the
reward designer is to modify the underlying reward function cost-efficiently
while ensuring that any approximately optimal deterministic policy under the
new reward function is admissible and performs well under the original reward
function. This problem can be viewed as a dual to the problem of optimal reward
poisoning attacks: instead of forcing an agent to adopt a specific policy, the
reward designer incentivizes an agent to avoid taking actions that are
inadmissible in certain states. Perhaps surprisingly, and in contrast to the
problem of optimal reward poisoning attacks, we first show that the reward
design problem for admissible policy teaching is computationally challenging,
and it is NP-hard to find an approximately optimal reward modification. We then
proceed by formulating a surrogate problem whose optimal solution approximates
the optimal solution to the reward design problem in our setting, but is more
amenable to optimization techniques and analysis. For this surrogate problem,
we present characterization results that provide bounds on the value of the
optimal solution. Finally, we design a local search algorithm to solve the
surrogate problem and showcase its utility using simulation-based experiments.</span>

subgraph in a random dense $G(n, p)$ graph have been proposed, with an emphasis
on planted cliques. Such methods can identify the planted subgraph in
polynomial time, but are all limited to several subgraph structures. Here, we
present PYGON, a graph neural network-based algorithm, which is insensitive to
the structure of the planted subgraph. This is the first algorithm that uses
advanced learning tools for recovering dense subgraphs. We show that PYGON can
recover cliques of sizes $\Theta\left(\sqrt{n}\right)$, where $n$ is the size
of the background graph, comparable with the state of the art. We also show
that the same algorithm can recover multiple other planted subgraphs of size
$\Theta\left(\sqrt{n}\right)$, in both directed and undirected graphs. We
suggest a conjecture that no polynomial time PAC-learning algorithm can detect
planted dense subgraphs with size smaller than $O\left(\sqrt{n}\right)$, even
if in principle one could find dense subgraphs of logarithmic size.</span>

high-throughput experiments have obvious high costs and technical
challenges.Therefore, we design a graph neural network based method to predict
DSBs (GraphDSB), using DNA sequence features and chromosome structure

introduce Jumping Knowledge architecture and several effective structural
encoding methods. The contribution of structural information to the prediction
of DSBs is verified by the experiments on datasets from normal human epidermal

ablation studies further demonstrate the effectiveness of the designed

                    <span>Analyzing numerous or long time series is difficult in practice due to the
high storage costs and computational requirements. Therefore, techniques have
been proposed to generate compact similarity-preserving representations of time
series, enabling real-time similarity search on large in-memory data
collections. However, the existing techniques are not ideally suited for
assessing similarity when sequences are locally out of phase. In this paper, we
propose the use of product quantization for efficient similarity-based
comparison of time series under time warping. The idea is to first compress the
data by partitioning the time series into equal length sub-sequences which are
represented by a short code. The distance between two time series can then be
efficiently approximated by pre-computed elastic distances between their codes.
The partitioning into sub-sequences forces unwanted alignments, which we
address with a pre-alignment step using the maximal overlap discrete wavelet
transform (MODWT). To demonstrate the efficiency and accuracy of our method, we
perform an extensive experimental evaluation on benchmark datasets in nearest
neighbors classification and clustering applications. Overall, the proposed
solution emerges as a highly efficient (both in terms of memory usage and
computation time) replacement for elastic measures in time series applications.</span>

                    <span>The explicit low-rank regularization, e.g., nuclear norm regularization, has
been widely used in imaging sciences. However, it has been found that implicit
regularization outperforms explicit ones in various image processing tasks.
Another issue is that the fixed explicit regularization limits the
applicability to broad kinds of images since different images favor different
features captured by using different explicit regularizations. As such, this
paper proposes a new adaptive and implicit low-rank regularization that
captures the low-rank prior dynamically from the training data. At the core of
our new adaptive and implicit low-rank regularization is parameterizing the
Laplacian matrix in the Dirichlet energy-based regularization with a neural
network, and we call the proposed model \textit{AIR-Net}. Theoretically, we
show that the adaptive regularization of AIR-Net enhances the implicit
regularization and vanishes at the end of training. We validate AIR-Net&#x27;s
effectiveness on various benchmark tasks, indicating that the AIR-Net is
particularly favorable for the scenarios when the missing entries are
non-uniform. The code can be found at

                    <span>Counterfactual examples for an input -- perturbations that change specific
features but not others -- have been shown to be useful for evaluating bias of
machine learning models, e.g., against specific demographic groups. However,
generating counterfactual examples for images is non-trivial due to the
underlying causal structure on the various features of an image. To be
meaningful, generated perturbations need to satisfy constraints implied by the
causal model. We present a method for generating counterfactuals by
incorporating a structural causal model (SCM) in an improved variant of
Adversarially Learned Inference (ALI), that generates counterfactuals in
accordance with the causal relationships between attributes of an image. Based
on the generated counterfactuals, we show how to explain a pre-trained machine
learning classifier, evaluate its bias, and mitigate the bias using a
counterfactual regularizer. On the Morpho-MNIST dataset, our method generates
counterfactuals comparable in quality to prior work on SCM-based
counterfactuals (DeepSCM), while on the more complex CelebA dataset our method
outperforms DeepSCM in generating high-quality valid counterfactuals. Moreover,
generated counterfactuals are indistinguishable from reconstructed images in a
human evaluation experiment and we subsequently use them to evaluate the
fairness of a standard classifier trained on CelebA data. We show that the
classifier is biased w.r.t. skin and hair color, and how counterfactual
regularization can remove those biases.</span>

                    <span>Social media has become an effective platform to generate and spread fake
news that can mislead people and even distort public opinion. Centralized
methods for fake news detection, however, cannot effectively protect user
privacy during the process of centralized data collection for training models.
Moreover, it cannot fully involve user feedback in the loop of learning
detection models for further enhancing fake news detection. To overcome these
challenges, this paper proposed a novel decentralized method, Human-in-the-loop
Based Swarm Learning (HBSL), to integrate user feedback into the loop of
learning and inference for recognizing fake news without violating user privacy
in a decentralized manner. It consists of distributed nodes that are able to
independently learn and detect fake news on local data. Furthermore, detection
models trained on these nodes can be enhanced through decentralized model
merging. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms
the state-of-the-art decentralized method in regard of detecting fake news on a

models (TagRec, MTPR, and CRGAN) learn to generate personalized and
fake-but-realistic rankings of preferences for top-N recommendations by using
previous interactions. This work successfully replicates the results published
in the original paper and discusses the impact of certain differences between
the CFGAN framework and the model used in the original evaluation. The absence
of random noise and the use of real user profiles as condition vectors leaves
the generator prone to learn a degenerate solution in which the output vector
is identical to the input vector, therefore, behaving essentially as a simple
autoencoder. The work further expands the experimental analysis comparing CFGAN
against a selection of simple and well-known properly optimized baselines,
observing that CFGAN is not consistently competitive against them despite its
high computational cost. To ensure the reproducibility of these analyses, this

                    <span>Pre-trained language models (LMs) often struggle to reason logically or
generalize in a compositional fashion. Recent work suggests that incorporating
external entity knowledge can improve LMs&#x27; abilities to reason and generalize.
However, the effect of explicitly providing entity abstraction remains unclear,
especially with recent studies suggesting that pre-trained LMs already encode
some of that knowledge in their parameters. We study the utility of
incorporating entity type abstractions into pre-trained Transformers and test
these methods on four NLP tasks requiring different forms of logical reasoning:
(1) compositional language understanding with text-based relational reasoning
(CLUTRR), (2) abductive reasoning (ProofWriter), (3) multi-hop question
answering (HotpotQA), and (4) conversational question answering (CoQA). We
propose and empirically explore three ways to add such abstraction: (i) as
additional input embeddings, (ii) as a separate sequence to encode, and (iii)
as an auxiliary prediction task for the model. Overall, our analysis
demonstrates that models with abstract entity knowledge performs better than
without it. However, our experiments also show that the benefits strongly
depend on the technique used and the task at hand. The best abstraction aware
models achieved an overall accuracy of 88.8% and 91.8% compared to the baseline
model achieving 62.3% and 89.8% on CLUTRR and ProofWriter respectively. In
addition, abstraction-aware models showed improved compositional generalization
in both interpolation and extrapolation settings. However, for HotpotQA and
CoQA, we find that F1 scores improve by only 0.5% on average. Our results
suggest that the benefit of explicit abstraction is significant in formally
defined logical reasoning settings requiring many reasoning hops, but point to
the notion that it is less beneficial for NLP tasks having less formal logical
structure.</span>

                    <span>Chemistry research has both high material and computational costs to conduct
experiments. Institutions thus consider chemical data to be valuable and there
have been few efforts to construct large public datasets for machine learning.
Another challenge is that different intuitions are interested in different
classes of molecules, creating heterogeneous data that cannot be easily joined
by conventional distributed training. In this work, we introduce federated
heterogeneous molecular learning to address these challenges. Federated
learning allows end-users to build a global model collaboratively while keeping
the training data distributed over isolated clients. Due to the lack of related
research, we first simulate a heterogeneous federated learning benchmark
(FedChem) by jointly performing scaffold splitting and latent Dirichlet
allocation on existing datasets for heterogeneously distributed client data.
Our results on FedChem show that significant learning challenges arise when
working with heterogeneous molecules across clients. We then propose a method
to alleviate the problem, namely Federated Learning by Instance reweighTing
(FLIT(+)). FLIT(+) can align the local training across heterogeneous clients by
improving the performance for uncertain samples. Comprehensive experiments
conducted on our new benchmark FedChem validate the advantages of this method
over other federated learning schemes. FedChem should enable a new type of
collaboration for improving AI in chemistry that mitigates concerns about
valuable chemical data.</span>

                    <span>Annotating musical beats is a very long in tedious process. In order to
combat this problem, we present a new self-supervised learning pretext task for
beat tracking and downbeat estimation. This task makes use of Spleeter, an
audio source separation model, to separate a song&#x27;s drums from the rest of its
signal. The first set of signals are used as positives, and by extension
negatives, for contrastive learning pre-training. The drum-less signals, on the
other hand, are used as anchors. When pre-training a fully-convolutional and
recurrent model using this pretext task, an onset function is learned. In some
cases, this function was found to be mapped to periodic elements in a song. We
found that pre-trained models outperformed randomly initialized models when a
beat tracking training set was extremely small (less than 10 examples). When
that was not the case, pre-training led to a learning speed-up that caused the
model to overfit to the training set. More generally, this work defines new
perspectives in the realm of musical self-supervised learning. It is notably
one of the first works to use audio source separation as a fundamental
component of self-supervision.</span>

                    <span>Convolutional neural networks have gained vast popularity due to their
excellent performance in the fields of computer vision, image processing, and
others. Unfortunately, it is now well known that convolutional networks often
produce erroneous results - for example, minor perturbations of the inputs of
these networks can result in severe classification errors. Numerous
verification approaches have been proposed in recent years to prove the absence
of such errors, but these are typically geared for fully connected networks and
suffer from exacerbated scalability issues when applied to convolutional
networks. To address this gap, we present here the Cnn-Abs framework, which is
particularly aimed at the verification of convolutional networks. The core of
Cnn-Abs is an abstraction-refinement technique, which simplifies the
verification problem through the removal of convolutional connections in a way
that soundly creates an over-approximation of the original problem; and which
restores these connections if the resulting problem becomes too abstract.
Cnn-Abs is designed to use existing verification engines as a backend, and our
evaluation demonstrates that it can significantly boost the performance of a
state-of-the-art DNN verification engine, reducing runtime by 15.7% on average.</span>

studying from the trained dataset. Spinach is a leaf vegetable that contains
vitamins and nutrients. In our research, a Deep learning method has been used
that can automatically identify spinach and this method has a dataset of a
total of five species of spinach that contains 3785 images. Four Convolutional
Neural Network (CNN) models were used to classify our spinach. These models
give more accurate results for image classification. Before applying these
models there is some preprocessing of the image data. For the preprocessing of
data, some methods need to happen. Those are RGB conversion, filtering, resize
&amp; rescaling, and categorization. After applying these methods image data are
pre-processed and ready to be used in the classifier algorithms. The accuracy
of these classifiers is in between 98.68% - 99.79%. Among those models, VGG16
achieved the highest accuracy of 99.79%.</span>

                    <span>Local explainability methods -- those which seek to generate an explanation
for each prediction -- are becoming increasingly prevalent due to the need for
practitioners to rationalize their model outputs. However, comparing local
explainability methods is difficult since they each generate outputs in various
scales and dimensions. Furthermore, due to the stochastic nature of some
explainability methods, it is possible for different runs of a method to
produce contradictory explanations for a given observation. In this paper, we
propose a topology-based framework to extract a simplified representation from
a set of local explanations. We do so by first modeling the relationship
between the explanation space and the model predictions as a scalar function.
Then, we compute the topological skeleton of this function. This topological
skeleton acts as a signature for such functions, which we use to compare
different explanation methods. We demonstrate that our framework can not only
reliably identify differences between explainability techniques but also
provides stable representations. Then, we show how our framework can be used to
identify appropriate parameters for local explainability methods. Our framework
is simple, does not require complex optimizations, and can be broadly applied
to most local explanation methods. We believe the practicality and versatility
of our approach will help promote topology-based approaches as a tool for
understanding and comparing explanation methods.</span>

                    <span>Deep learning is one of the most successful and far-reaching strategies used
in machine learning today. However, the scale and utility of neural networks is
still greatly limited by the current hardware used to train them. These
concerns have become increasingly pressing as conventional computers quickly
approach physical limitations that will slow performance improvements in years
to come. For these reasons, scientists have begun to explore alternative
computing platforms, like quantum computers, for training neural networks. In
recent years, variational quantum circuits have emerged as one of the most
successful approaches to quantum deep learning on noisy intermediate scale
quantum devices. We propose a hybrid quantum-classical neural network
architecture where each neuron is a variational quantum circuit. We empirically
analyze the performance of this hybrid neural network on a series of binary
classification data sets using a simulated universal quantum computer and a
state of the art universal quantum computer. On simulated hardware, we observe
that the hybrid neural network achieves roughly 10% higher classification
accuracy and 20% better minimization of cost than an individual variational
quantum circuit. On quantum hardware, we observe that each model only performs
well when the qubit and gate count is sufficiently small.</span>

                    <span>Continual learning in environments with shifting data distributions is a
challenging problem with several real-world applications. In this paper we
consider settings in which the data distribution(task) shifts abruptly and the
timing of these shifts are not known. Furthermore, we consider a
semi-supervised task-agnostic setting in which the learning algorithm has
access to both task-segmented and unsegmented data for offline training. We
propose a novel approach called mixture of Basismodels (MoB) for addressing
this problem setting. The core idea is to learn a small set of basis models and
to construct a dynamic, task-dependent mixture of the models to predict for the
current task. We also propose a new methodology to detect observations that are
out-of-distribution with respect to the existing basis models and to
instantiate new models as needed. We test our approach in multiple domains and
show that it attains better prediction error than existing methods in most
cases while using fewer models than other multiple model approaches. Moreover,
we analyze the latent task representations learned by MoB and show that similar
tasks tend to cluster in the latent space and that the latent representation
shifts at the task boundaries when tasks are dissimilar.</span>

                    <span>Fuzzy Cognitive Maps (FCMs) have emerged as an interpretable signed weighted
digraph method consisting of nodes (concepts) and weights which represent the
dependencies among the concepts. Although FCMs have attained considerable
achievements in various time series prediction applications, designing an FCM
model with time-efficient training method is still an open challenge. Thus,
this paper introduces a novel univariate time series forecasting technique,
which is composed of a group of randomized high order FCM models labeled
R-HFCM. The novelty of the proposed R-HFCM model is relevant to merging the
concepts of FCM and Echo State Network (ESN) as an efficient and particular
family of Reservoir Computing (RC) models, where the least squares algorithm is
applied to train the model. From another perspective, the structure of R-HFCM
consists of the input layer, reservoir layer, and output layer in which only
the output layer is trainable while the weights of each sub-reservoir
components are selected randomly and keep constant during the training process.
As case studies, this model considers solar energy forecasting with public data
for Brazilian solar stations as well as Malaysia dataset, which includes hourly
electric load and temperature data of the power supply company of the city of
Johor in Malaysia. The experiment also includes the effect of the map size,
activation function, the presence of bias and the size of the reservoir on the
accuracy of R-HFCM method. The obtained results confirm the outperformance of
the proposed R-HFCM model in comparison to the other methods. This study
provides evidence that FCM can be a new way to implement a reservoir of
dynamics in time series modelling.</span>

                    <span>Geosteering of wells requires fast interpretation of geophysical logs which
is a non-unique inverse problem. Current work presents a proof-of-concept
approach to multi-modal probabilistic inversion of logs using a single
evaluation of an artificial deep neural network (DNN). A mixture density DNN
(MDN) is trained using the &quot;multiple-trajectory-prediction&quot; (MTP) loss
functions, which avoids mode collapse typical for traditional MDNs, and allows
multi-modal prediction ahead of data. The proposed approach is verified on the
real-time stratigraphic inversion of gamma-ray logs. The multi-modal predictor
outputs several likely inverse solutions/predictions, providing more accurate
and realistic solutions compared to a deterministic regression using a DNN. For
these likely stratigraphic curves, the model simultaneously predicts their
probabilities, which are implicitly learned from the training geological data.
The stratigraphy predictions and their probabilities obtained in milliseconds
from the MDN can enable better real-time decisions under geological
uncertainties.</span>

clustering algorithms in grouping similar objects into clusters. This paper
introduces a new similarity measure called point-set kernel which computes the
similarity between an object and a set of objects. The proposed clustering
procedure utilizes this new measure to characterize every cluster grown from a
seed object. We show that the new clustering procedure is both effective and
efficient that enables it to deal with large scale datasets. In contrast,
existing clustering algorithms are either efficient or effective. In comparison
with the state-of-the-art density-peak clustering and scalable kernel k-means

displaced control points. We leverage the power of neural networks to inject
the underlying shape geometry into the deformation parameters. The goal of our
technique is to enable a realistic and intuitive shape deformation. Our method
is built upon moving least-squares (MLS), since it minimizes a weighted sum of
the given control point displacements. Traditionally, the influence of each
control point on every point in space (i.e., the weighting function) is defined
using inverse distance heuristics. In this work, we opt to learn the weighting
function, by training a neural network on the control points from a single
input shape, and exploit the innate smoothness of neural networks. Our
geometry-aware control point deformation is agnostic to the surface
representation and quality; it can be applied to point clouds or meshes,
including non-manifold and disconnected surface soups. We show that our
technique facilitates intuitive piecewise smooth deformations, which are well
suited for manufactured objects. We show the advantages of our approach

                    <span>Controlling antenna tilts in cellular networks is imperative to reach an
efficient trade-off between network coverage and capacity. In this paper, we
devise algorithms learning optimal tilt control policies from existing data (in
the so-called passive learning setting) or from data actively generated by the
algorithms (the active learning setting). We formalize the design of such
algorithms as a Best Policy Identification (BPI) problem in Contextual Linear
Multi-Arm Bandits (CL-MAB). An arm represents an antenna tilt update; the
context captures current network conditions; the reward corresponds to an
improvement of performance, mixing coverage and capacity; and the objective is
to identify, with a given level of confidence, an approximately optimal policy
(a function mapping the context to an arm with maximal reward). For CL-MAB in
both active and passive learning settings, we derive information-theoretical
lower bounds on the number of samples required by any algorithm returning an
approximately optimal policy with a given level of certainty, and devise
algorithms achieving these fundamental limits. We apply our algorithms to the
Remote Electrical Tilt (RET) optimization problem in cellular networks, and
show that they can produce optimal tilt update policy using much fewer data
samples than naive or existing rule-based learning algorithms.</span>

                    <span>Financial forecasting has been an important and active area of machine
learning research because of the challenges it presents and the potential
rewards that even minor improvements in prediction accuracy or forecasting may
entail. Traditionally, financial forecasting has heavily relied on quantitative
indicators and metrics derived from structured financial statements. Earnings
conference call data, including text and audio, is an important source of
unstructured data that has been used for various prediction tasks using deep
earning and related approaches. However, current deep learning-based methods
are limited in the way that they deal with numeric data; numbers are typically
treated as plain-text tokens without taking advantage of their underlying
numeric structure. This paper describes a numeric-oriented hierarchical
transformer model to predict stock returns, and financial risk using
multi-modal aligned earnings calls data by taking advantage of the different
categories of numbers (monetary, temporal, percentages etc.) and their
magnitude. We present the results of a comprehensive evaluation of NumHTML
against several state-of-the-art baselines using a real-world publicly
available dataset. The results indicate that NumHTML significantly outperforms
the current state-of-the-art across a variety of evaluation metrics and that it
has the potential to offer significant financial gains in a practical trading
context.</span>

                    <span>Robotic manipulation of cloth remains challenging for robotics due to the
complex dynamics of the cloth, lack of a low-dimensional state representation,
and self-occlusions. In contrast to previous model-based approaches that learn
a pixel-based dynamics model or a compressed latent vector dynamics, we propose
to learn a particle-based dynamics model from a partial point cloud
observation. To overcome the challenges of partial observability, we infer
which visible points are connected on the underlying cloth mesh. We then learn
a dynamics model over this visible connectivity graph. Compared to previous
learning-based approaches, our model poses strong inductive bias with its
particle based representation for learning the underlying cloth physics; it is
invariant to visual features; and the predictions can be more easily
visualized. We show that our method greatly outperforms previous
state-of-the-art model-based and model-free reinforcement learning methods in
simulation. Furthermore, we demonstrate zero-shot sim-to-real transfer where we
deploy the model trained in simulation on a Franka arm and show that the model
can successfully smooth different types of cloth from crumpled configurations.

                    <span>Data-driven models created by machine learning gain in importance in all
fields of design and engineering. They have high potential to assists
decision-makers in creating novel artefacts with a better performance and
sustainability. However, limited generalization and the black-box nature of
these models induce limited explainability and reusability. These drawbacks
provide significant barriers retarding adoption in engineering design. To
overcome this situation, we propose a component-based approach to create
partial component models by machine learning (ML). This component-based
approach aligns deep learning to systems engineering (SE). By means of the
example of energy efficient building design, we first demonstrate
generalization of the component-based method by accurately predicting the
performance of designs with random structure different from training data.
Second, we illustrate explainability by local sampling, sensitivity information
and rules derived from low-depth decision trees and by evaluating this
information from an engineering design perspective. The key for explainability
is that activations at interfaces between the components are interpretable
engineering quantities. In this way, the hierarchical component system forms a
deep neural network (DNN) that directly integrates information for engineering
explainability. The large range of possible configurations in composing
components allows the examination of novel unseen design cases with
understandable data-driven models. The matching of parameter ranges of
components by similar probability distribution produces reusable,
well-generalizing, and trustworthy models. The approach adapts the model
structure to engineering methods of systems engineering and domain knowledge.</span>

                    <span>We suggest a simple practical method to combine the human and artificial
intelligence to both learn best investment practices of fund managers, and
provide recommendations to improve them. Our approach is based on a combination
of Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL) and RL. First, the IRL component learns
the intent of fund managers as suggested by their trading history, and recovers
their implied reward function. At the second step, this reward function is used
by a direct RL algorithm to optimize asset allocation decisions. We show that
our method is able to improve over the performance of individual fund managers.</span>

                    <span>Machine learning (ML) has often been applied to space weather (SW) problems
in recent years. SW originates from solar perturbations and is comprised of the
resulting complex variations they cause within the systems between the Sun and
Earth. These systems are tightly coupled and not well understood. This creates
a need for skillful models with knowledge about the confidence of their
predictions. One example of such a dynamical system is the thermosphere, the
neutral region of Earth&#x27;s upper atmosphere. Our inability to forecast it has
severe repercussions in the context of satellite drag and collision avoidance
operations for objects in low Earth orbit. Even with (assumed) perfect driver
forecasts, our incomplete knowledge of the system results in often inaccurate
neutral mass density predictions. Continuing efforts are being made to improve
model accuracy, but density models rarely provide estimates of uncertainty. In
this work, we propose two techniques to develop nonlinear ML models to predict
thermospheric density while providing calibrated uncertainty estimates: Monte
Carlo (MC) dropout and direct prediction of the probability distribution, both
using the negative logarithm of predictive density (NLPD) loss function. We
show the performance for models trained on local and global datasets. This
shows that NLPD provides similar results for both techniques but the direct
probability method has a much lower computational cost. For the global model
regressed on the SET HASDM density database, we achieve errors of 11% on
independent test data with well-calibrated uncertainty estimates. Using an
in-situ CHAMP density dataset, both techniques provide test error on the order
of 13%. The CHAMP models (on independent data) are within 2% of perfect
calibration for all prediction intervals tested. This model can also be used to
obtain global predictions with uncertainties at a given epoch.</span>

                    <span>Acquiring information on large areas on the earth&#x27;s surface through satellite
cameras allows us to see much more than we can see while standing on the
ground. This assists us in detecting and monitoring the physical
characteristics of an area like land-use patterns, atmospheric conditions,
forest cover, and many unlisted aspects. The obtained images not only keep
track of continuous natural phenomena but are also crucial in tackling the
global challenge of severe deforestation. Among which Amazon basin accounts for
the largest share every year. Proper data analysis would help limit detrimental
effects on the ecosystem and biodiversity with a sustainable healthy
atmosphere. This report aims to label the satellite image chips of the Amazon
rainforest with atmospheric and various classes of land cover or land use
through different machine learning and superior deep learning models.
Evaluation is done based on the F2 metric, while for loss function, we have
both sigmoid cross-entropy as well as softmax cross-entropy. Images are fed
indirectly to the machine learning classifiers after only features are
extracted using pre-trained ImageNet architectures. Whereas for deep learning
models, ensembles of fine-tuned ImageNet pre-trained models are used via
transfer learning. Our best score was achieved so far with the F2 metric is

                    <span>Control certificates based on barrier functions have been a powerful tool to
generate probably safe control policies for dynamical systems. However,
existing methods based on barrier certificates are normally for white-box
systems with differentiable dynamics, which makes them inapplicable to many
practical applications where the system is a black-box and cannot be accurately
modeled. On the other side, model-free reinforcement learning (RL) methods for
black-box systems suffer from lack of safety guarantees and low sampling
efficiency. In this paper, we propose a novel method that can learn safe
control policies and barrier certificates for black-box dynamical systems,
without requiring for an accurate system model. Our method re-designs the loss
function to back-propagate gradient to the control policy even when the
black-box dynamical system is non-differentiable, and we show that the safety
certificates hold on the black-box system. Empirical results in simulation show
that our method can significantly improve the performance of the learned
policies by achieving nearly 100% safety and goal reaching rates using much
fewer training samples, compared to state-of-the-art black-box safe control
methods. Our learned agents can also generalize to unseen scenarios while
keeping the original performance. The source code can be found at

problems, and we see the framework has been applied to build relationship
between recording wavefield and velocity (Yang et al., 2016). Here we will
extend the work from 2 perspectives, one is deriving a more appropriate loss
function, as we now, pixel-2-pixel comparison might not be the best choice to
characterize image structure, and we will elaborate on how to construct cost
function to capture high level feature to enhance the model performance.
Another dimension is searching for the more appropriate neural architecture,
which is a subset of an even bigger picture, the automatic machine learning, or
AutoML. There are several famous networks, U-net, ResNet (He et al., 2016) and
DenseNet (Huang et al., 2017), and they achieve phenomenal results for certain
problems, yet it&#x27;s hard to argue they are the best for inversion problems
without thoroughly searching within certain space. Here we will be showing our

                    <span>We consider the problem of variance reduction in randomized controlled
trials, through the use of covariates correlated with the outcome but
independent of the treatment. We propose a machine learning regression-adjusted
treatment effect estimator, which we call MLRATE. MLRATE uses machine learning
predictors of the outcome to reduce estimator variance. It employs
cross-fitting to avoid overfitting biases, and we prove consistency and
asymptotic normality under general conditions. MLRATE is robust to poor
predictions from the machine learning step: if the predictions are uncorrelated
with the outcomes, the estimator performs asymptotically no worse than the
standard difference-in-means estimator, while if predictions are highly
correlated with outcomes, the efficiency gains are large. In A/A tests, for a
set of 48 outcome metrics commonly monitored in Facebook experiments the
estimator has over 70% lower variance than the simple difference-in-means
estimator, and about 19% lower variance than the common univariate procedure
which adjusts only for pre-experiment values of the outcome.</span>

introduces a new similarity measure called point-set kernel which computes the
similarity between an object and a set of objects. The proposed clustering
procedure utilizes this new measure to characterize every cluster grown from a
seed object. We show that the new clustering procedure is both effective and
efficient that enables it to deal with large scale datasets. In contrast,
existing clustering algorithms are either efficient or effective. In comparison
with the state-of-the-art density-peak clustering and scalable kernel k-means

                    <span>Spectral clustering has been one of the widely used methods for community
detection in networks. However, large-scale networks bring computational
challenges to the eigenvalue decomposition therein. In this paper, we study the
spectral clustering using randomized sketching algorithms from a statistical
perspective, where we typically assume the network data are generated from a
stochastic block model that is not necessarily of full rank. To do this, we
first use the recently developed sketching algorithms to obtain two randomized
spectral clustering algorithms, namely, the random projection-based and the
random sampling-based spectral clustering. Then we study the theoretical bounds
of the resulting algorithms in terms of the approximation error for the
population adjacency matrix, the misclassification error, and the estimation
error for the link probability matrix. It turns out that, under mild
conditions, the randomized spectral clustering algorithms lead to the same
theoretical bounds as those of the original spectral clustering algorithm. We
also extend the results to degree-corrected stochastic block models. Numerical
experiments support our theoretical findings and show the efficiency of
randomized methods. A new R package called Rclust is developed and made
available to the public.</span>

                    <span>This work studies how the introduction of the entropic regularization term in
unbalanced Optimal Transport (OT) models may alter their homogeneity with
respect to the input measures. We observe that in common settings (including
balanced OT and unbalanced OT with Kullback-Leibler divergence to the
marginals), although the optimal transport cost itself is not homogeneous,
optimal transport plans and the so-called Sinkhorn divergences are indeed
homogeneous. However, homogeneity does not hold in more general Unbalanced
Regularized Optimal Transport (UROT) models, for instance those using the Total
Variation as divergence to the marginals. We propose to modify the entropic
regularization term to retrieve an UROT model that is homogeneous while
preserving most properties of the standard UROT model. We showcase the
importance of using our Homogeneous UROT (HUROT) model when it comes to
regularize Optimal Transport with Boundary, a transportation model involving a
spatially varying divergence to the marginals for which the standard
(inhomogeneous) UROT model would yield inappropriate behavior.</span>

a large majority of the projections lie on vertices of the polytopes. To do
these projections efficiently we derive a vertex-oriented incremental algorithm
to project a point onto any arbitrary polytope, as well as give specific
algorithms to cater to simplex projection and polytopes where the unit box is
cut by planes. Such settings are especially useful in web-scale applications
such as optimal matching or allocation problems. Several such problems in
internet marketplaces (e-commerce, ride-sharing, food delivery, professional

                    <span>We study the transfer learning process between two linear regression
problems. An important and timely special case is when the regressors are
overparameterized and perfectly interpolate their training data. We examine a
parameter transfer mechanism whereby a subset of the parameters of the target
task solution are constrained to the values learned for a related source task.
We analytically characterize the generalization error of the target task in
terms of the salient factors in the transfer learning architecture, i.e., the
number of examples available, the number of (free) parameters in each of the
tasks, the number of parameters transferred from the source to target task, and
the relation between the two tasks. Our non-asymptotic analysis shows that the
generalization error of the target task follows a two-dimensional double
descent trend (with respect to the number of free parameters in each of the
tasks) that is controlled by the transfer learning factors. Our analysis points
to specific cases where the transfer of parameters is beneficial as a
substitute for extra overparameterization (i.e., additional free parameters in
the target task). Specifically, we show that the usefulness of a transfer
learning setting is fragile and depends on a delicate interplay among the set
of transferred parameters, the relation between the tasks, and the true
solution. We also demonstrate that overparameterized transfer learning is not
necessarily more beneficial when the source task is closer or identical to the
target task.</span>

                    <span>We derive conditions for the existence of fixed points of nonnegative neural
networks, an important research objective to understand the behavior of neural
networks in modern applications involving autoencoders and loop unrolling
techniques, among others. In particular, we show that neural networks with
nonnegative inputs and nonnegative parameters can be recognized as monotonic
and (weakly) scalable functions within the framework of nonlinear
Perron-Frobenius theory. This fact enables us to derive conditions for the
existence of a nonempty fixed point set of the nonnegative neural networks, and
these conditions are weaker than those obtained recently using arguments in
convex analysis, which are typically based on the assumption of nonexpansivity
of the activation functions. Furthermore, we prove that the shape of the fixed
point set of monotonic and weakly scalable neural networks is often an
interval, which degenerates to a point for the case of scalable networks. The
chief results of this paper are verified in numerical simulations, where we
consider an autoencoder-type network that first compresses angular power
spectra in massive MIMO systems, and, second, reconstruct the input spectra
from the compressed signals.</span>

                    <span>Network homophily, the tendency of similar nodes to be connected, and
transitivity, the tendency of two nodes being connected if they share a common
neighbor, are conflated properties in network analysis, since one mechanism can
drive the other. Here we present a generative model and corresponding inference
procedure that are capable of distinguishing between both mechanisms. Our
approach is based on a variation of the stochastic block model (SBM) with the
addition of triadic closure edges, and its inference can identify the most
plausible mechanism responsible for the existence of every edge in the network,
in addition to the underlying community structure itself. We show how the
method can evade the detection of spurious communities caused solely by the
formation of triangles in the network, and how it can improve the performance
of edge prediction when compared to the pure version of the SBM without triadic
closure.</span>

                    <span>We propose a new method for supervised learning with multiple sets of
features (&quot;views&quot;). Cooperative learning combines the usual squared error loss
of predictions with an &quot;agreement&quot; penalty to encourage the predictions from
different data views to agree. By varying the weight of the agreement penalty,
we get a continuum of solutions that include the well-known early and late
fusion approaches. Cooperative learning chooses the degree of agreement (or
fusion) in an adaptive manner, using a validation set or cross-validation to
estimate test set prediction error. One version of our fitting procedure is
modular, where one can choose different fitting mechanisms (e.g. lasso, random
forests, boosting, neural networks) appropriate for different data views. In
the setting of cooperative regularized linear regression, the method combines
the lasso penalty with the agreement penalty. The method can be especially
powerful when the different data views share some underlying relationship in
their signals that we aim to strengthen, while each view has its idiosyncratic
noise that we aim to reduce. We illustrate the effectiveness of our proposed
method on simulated and real data examples.</span>

                    <span>Tristructural isotropic (TRISO)-coated particle fuel is a robust nuclear fuel
and determining its reliability is critical for the success of advanced nuclear
technologies. However, TRISO failure probabilities are small and the associated
computational models are expensive. We used coupled active learning,
multifidelity modeling, and subset simulation to estimate the failure
probabilities of TRISO fuels using several 1D and 2D models. With multifidelity
modeling, we replaced expensive high-fidelity (HF) model evaluations with
information fusion from two low-fidelity (LF) models. For the 1D TRISO models,
we considered three multifidelity modeling strategies: only Kriging, Kriging LF
prediction plus Kriging correction, and deep neural network (DNN) LF prediction
plus Kriging correction. While the results across these multifidelity modeling
strategies compared satisfactorily, strategies employing information fusion
from two LF models consistently called the HF model least often. Next, for the
2D TRISO model, we considered two multifidelity modeling strategies: DNN LF
prediction plus Kriging correction (data-driven) and 1D TRISO LF prediction
plus Kriging correction (physics-based). The physics-based strategy, as
expected, consistently required the fewest calls to the HF model. However, the
data-driven strategy had a lower overall simulation time since the DNN
predictions are instantaneous, and the 1D TRISO model requires a non-negligible
simulation time.</span>

                    <span>We consider the joint design and control of discrete-time stochastic
dynamical systems over a finite time horizon. We formulate the problem as a
multi-step optimization problem under uncertainty seeking to identify a system
design and a control policy that jointly maximize the expected sum of rewards
collected over the time horizon considered. The transition function, the reward
function and the policy are all parametrized, assumed known and differentiable
with respect to their parameters. We then introduce a deep reinforcement
learning algorithm combining policy gradient methods with model-based
optimization techniques to solve this problem. In essence, our algorithm
iteratively approximates the gradient of the expected return via Monte-Carlo
sampling and automatic differentiation and takes projected gradient ascent
steps in the space of environment and policy parameters. This algorithm is
referred to as Direct Environment and Policy Search (DEPS). We assess the
performance of our algorithm in three environments concerned with the design
and control of a mass-spring-damper system, a small-scale off-grid power system
and a drone, respectively. In addition, our algorithm is benchmarked against a
state-of-the-art deep reinforcement learning algorithm used to tackle joint
design and control problems. We show that DEPS performs at least as well or
better in all three environments, consistently yielding solutions with higher
returns in fewer iterations. Finally, solutions produced by our algorithm are
also compared with solutions produced by an algorithm that does not jointly
optimize environment and policy parameters, highlighting the fact that higher
returns can be achieved when joint optimization is performed.</span>

                    <span>Assuming distributions are Gaussian often facilitates computations that are
otherwise intractable. We consider an agent who is designed to attain a low
information ratio with respect to a bandit environment with a Gaussian prior
distribution and a Gaussian likelihood function, but study the agent&#x27;s
performance when applied instead to a Bernoulli bandit. We establish a bound on
the increase in Bayesian regret when an agent interacts with the Bernoulli
bandit, relative to an information-theoretic bound satisfied with the Gaussian
bandit. If the Gaussian prior distribution and likelihood function are
sufficiently diffuse, this increase grows with the square-root of the time
horizon, and thus the per-timestep increase vanishes. Our results formalize the
folklore that so-called Bayesian agents remain effective when instantiated with
diffuse misspecified distributions.</span>

                    <span>What is learning? 20$^{st}$ century formalizations of learning theory --
which precipitated revolutions in artificial intelligence -- focus primarily on
$\mathit{in-distribution}$ learning, that is, learning under the assumption
that the training data are sampled from the same distribution as the evaluation
distribution. This assumption renders these theories inadequate for
characterizing 21$^{st}$ century real world data problems, which are typically
characterized by evaluation distributions that differ from the training data
distributions (referred to as out-of-distribution learning). We therefore make
a small change to existing formal definitions of learnability by relaxing that
assumption. We then introduce $\mathbf{learning\ efficiency}$ (LE) to quantify
the amount a learner is able to leverage data for a given problem, regardless
of whether it is an in- or out-of-distribution problem. We then define and
prove the relationship between generalized notions of learnability, and show
how this framework is sufficiently general to characterize transfer, multitask,
meta, continual, and lifelong learning. We hope this unification helps bridge
the gap between empirical practice and theoretical guidance in real world
problems. Finally, because biological learning continues to outperform machine
learning algorithms on certain OOD challenges, we discuss the limitations of
this framework vis-\&#x27;a-vis its ability to formalize biological learning,
suggesting multiple avenues for future research.</span>

                    <span>The paper introduces a novel conditional independence (CI) based method for
linear and nonlinear, lagged and contemporaneous causal discovery from
observational time series in the causally sufficient case. Existing CI-based
methods such as the PC algorithm and also common methods from other frameworks
suffer from low recall and partially inflated false positives for strong
autocorrelation which is an ubiquitous challenge in time series. The novel
method, PCMCI$^+$, extends PCMCI [Runge et al., 2019b] to include discovery of
contemporaneous links. PCMCI$^+$ improves the reliability of CI tests by
optimizing the choice of conditioning sets and even benefits from
autocorrelation. The method is order-independent and consistent in the oracle
case. A broad range of numerical experiments demonstrates that PCMCI$^+$ has
higher adjacency detection power and especially more contemporaneous
orientation recall compared to other methods while better controlling false
positives. Optimized conditioning sets also lead to much shorter runtimes than
the PC algorithm. PCMCI$^+$ can be of considerable use in many real world
application scenarios where often time resolutions are too coarse to resolve
time delays and strong autocorrelation is present.</span>

                    <span>Online Tensor Factorization (OTF) is a fundamental tool in learning
low-dimensional interpretable features from streaming multi-modal data. While
various algorithmic and theoretical aspects of OTF have been investigated
recently, a general convergence guarantee to stationary points of the objective
function without any incoherence or sparsity assumptions is still lacking even
for the i.i.d. case. In this work, we introduce a novel algorithm that learns a
CANDECOMP/PARAFAC (CP) basis from a given stream of tensor-valued data under
general constraints, including nonnegativity constraints that induce
interpretability of the learned CP basis. We prove that our algorithm converges
almost surely to the set of stationary points of the objective function under
the hypothesis that the sequence of data tensors is generated by an underlying
Markov chain. Our setting covers the classical i.i.d. case as well as a wide
range of application contexts including data streams generated by independent
or MCMC sampling. Our result closes a gap between OTF and Online Matrix
Factorization in global convergence analysis \commHL{for CP-decompositions}.
Experimentally, we show that our algorithm converges much faster than standard
algorithms for nonnegative tensor factorization tasks on both synthetic and
real-world data. Also, we demonstrate the utility of our algorithm on a diverse
set of examples from an image, video, and time-series data, illustrating how
one may learn qualitatively different CP-dictionaries from the same tensor data
by exploiting the tensor structure in multiple ways.</span>

                    <span>In this work, we study empirical risk minimization (ERM) within a federated
learning framework, where a central server minimizes an ERM objective function
using training data that is stored across $m$ clients. In this setting, the
Federated Averaging (FedAve) algorithm is the staple for determining
$\epsilon$-approximate solutions to the ERM problem. Similar to standard
optimization algorithms, the convergence analysis of FedAve only relies on
smoothness of the loss function in the optimization parameter. However, loss
functions are often very smooth in the training data too. To exploit this
additional smoothness, we propose the Federated Low Rank Gradient Descent
(FedLRGD) algorithm. Since smoothness in data induces an approximate low rank
structure on the loss function, our method first performs a few rounds of
communication between the server and clients to learn weights that the server
can use to approximate clients&#x27; gradients. Then, our method solves the ERM
problem at the server using inexact gradient descent. To show that FedLRGD can
have superior performance to FedAve, we present a notion of federated oracle
complexity as a counterpart to canonical oracle complexity. Under some
assumptions on the loss function, e.g., strong convexity in parameter,
$\eta$-H\&quot;older smoothness in data, etc., we prove that the federated oracle
complexity of FedLRGD scales like $\phi m(p/\epsilon)^{\Theta(d/\eta)}$ and
that of FedAve scales like $\phi m(p/\epsilon)^{3/4}$ (neglecting sub-dominant
factors), where $\phi\gg 1$ is a &quot;communication-to-computation ratio,&quot; $p$ is
the parameter dimension, and $d$ is the data dimension. Then, we show that when
$d$ is small and the loss function is sufficiently smooth in the data, FedLRGD
beats FedAve in federated oracle complexity. Finally, in the course of
analyzing FedLRGD, we also establish a result on low rank approximation of
latent variable models.</span>

                    <span>The problem of linear predictions has been extensively studied for the past
century under pretty generalized frameworks. Recent advances in the robust
statistics literature allow us to analyze robust versions of classical linear
models through the prism of Median of Means (MoM). Combining these approaches
in a piecemeal way might lead to ad-hoc procedures, and the restricted
theoretical conclusions that underpin each individual contribution may no
longer be valid. To meet these challenges coherently, in this study, we offer a
unified robust framework that includes a broad variety of linear prediction
problems on a Hilbert space, coupled with a generic class of loss functions.
Notably, we do not require any assumptions on the distribution of the outlying
data points ($\mathcal{O}$) nor the compactness of the support of the inlying
ones ($\mathcal{I}$). Under mild conditions on the dual norm, we show that for
misspecification level $\epsilon$, these estimators achieve an error rate of
$O(\max\left\{|\mathcal{O}|^{1/2}n^{-1/2}, |\mathcal{I}|^{1/2}n^{-1}
\right\}+\epsilon)$, matching the best-known rates in literature. This rate is
slightly slower than the classical rates of $O(n^{-1/2})$, indicating that we
need to pay a price in terms of error rates to obtain robust estimates.
Additionally, we show that this rate can be improved to achieve so-called
&#x60;&#x60;fast rates&quot; under additional assumptions.</span>

                    <span>Autoencoders are the simplest neural network for unsupervised learning, and
thus an ideal framework for studying feature learning. While a detailed
understanding of the dynamics of linear autoencoders has recently been
obtained, the study of non-linear autoencoders has been hindered by the
technical difficulty of handling training data with non-trivial correlations -
a fundamental prerequisite for feature extraction. Here, we study the dynamics
of feature learning in non-linear, shallow autoencoders. We derive a set of
asymptotically exact equations that describe the generalisation dynamics of
autoencoders trained with stochastic gradient descent (SGD) in the limit of
high-dimensional inputs. These equations reveal that autoencoders learn the
leading principal components of their inputs sequentially. An analysis of the
long-time dynamics explains the failure of sigmoidal autoencoders to learn with
tied weights, and highlights the importance of training the bias in ReLU
autoencoders. Building on previous results for linear networks, we analyse a
modification of the vanilla SGD algorithm which allows learning of the exact
principal components. Finally, we show that our equations accurately describe
the generalisation dynamics of non-linear autoencoders on realistic datasets
such as CIFAR10.</span>

                    <span>This paper proposes an efficient approach to learning disentangled
representations with causal mechanisms based on the difference of conditional
probabilities in original and new distributions. We approximate the difference
with models&#x27; generalization abilities so that it fits in the standard machine
learning framework and can be efficiently computed. In contrast to the
state-of-the-art approach, which relies on the learner&#x27;s adaptation speed to
new distribution, the proposed approach only requires evaluating the model&#x27;s
generalization ability. We provide a theoretical explanation for the advantage
of the proposed method, and our experiments show that the proposed technique is
1.9--11.0$\times$ more sample efficient and 9.4--32.4 times quicker than the
previous method on various tasks. The source code is available at

                    <span>The literature on using yield curves to forecast recessions customarily uses
10-year--three-month Treasury yield spread without verification on the pair
selection. This study investigates whether the predictive ability of spread can
be improved by letting a machine learning algorithm identify the best maturity
pair and coefficients. Our comprehensive analysis shows that, despite the
likelihood gain, the machine learning approach does not significantly improve
prediction, owing to the estimation error. This is robust to the forecasting
horizon, control variable, sample period, and oversampling of the recession
observations. Our finding supports the use of the 10-year--three-month spread.</span>

                    <span>This work studies the question of Representation Learning in RL: how can we
learn a compact low-dimensional representation such that on top of the
representation we can perform RL procedures such as exploration and
exploitation, in a sample efficient manner. We focus on the low-rank Markov
Decision Processes (MDPs) where the transition dynamics correspond to a
low-rank transition matrix. Unlike prior works that assume the representation
is known (e.g., linear MDPs), here we need to learn the representation for the
low-rank MDP. We study both the online RL and offline RL settings. For the
online setting, operating with the same computational oracles used in FLAMBE
(Agarwal et.al), the state-of-art algorithm for learning representations in
low-rank MDPs, we propose an algorithm REP-UCB Upper Confidence Bound driven
Representation learning for RL), which significantly improves the sample
complexity from $\widetilde{O}( A^9 d^7 / (\epsilon^{10} (1-\gamma)^{22}))$ for
FLAMBE to $\widetilde{O}( A^2 d^4 / (\epsilon^2 (1-\gamma)^{5}) )$ with $d$
being the rank of the transition matrix (or dimension of the ground truth
representation), $A$ being the number of actions, and $\gamma$ being the
discounted factor. Notably, REP-UCB is simpler than FLAMBE, as it directly
balances the interplay between representation learning, exploration, and
exploitation, while FLAMBE is an explore-then-commit style approach and has to
perform reward-free exploration step-by-step forward in time. For the offline
RL setting, we develop an algorithm that leverages pessimism to learn under a
partial coverage condition: our algorithm is able to compete against any policy
as long as it is covered by the offline distribution.</span>

                    <span>Evaluating the real-world performance of network protocols is challenging.
Randomized control trials (RCT) are expensive and inaccessible to most
researchers, while expert-designed simulators fail to capture complex behaviors
in real networks. We present CausalSim, a data-driven simulator for network
protocols that addresses this challenge. Learning network behavior from
observational data is complicated due to the bias introduced by the protocols
used during data collection. CausalSim uses traces from an initial RCT under a
set of protocols to learn a causal network model, effectively removing the
biases present in the data. Using this model, CausalSim can then simulate any
protocol over the same traces (i.e., for counterfactual predictions). Key to
CausalSim is the novel use of adversarial neural network training that exploits
distributional invariances that are present due to the training data coming
from an RCT. Our extensive evaluation of CausalSim on both real and synthetic
datasets and two use cases, including more than nine months of real data from
the Puffer video streaming system, shows that it provides accurate
counterfactual predictions, reducing prediction error by 44% and 53% on average
compared to expert-designed and standard supervised learning baselines.</span>

                    <span>We study the selection of adjustment sets for estimating the interventional
mean under an individualized treatment rule. We assume a non-parametric causal
graphical model with, possibly, hidden variables and at least one adjustment
set comprised of observable variables. Moreover, we assume that observable
variables have positive costs associated with them. We define the cost of an
observable adjustment set as the sum of the costs of the variables that
comprise it. We show that in this setting there exist adjustment sets that are
minimum cost optimal, in the sense that they yield non-parametric estimators of
the interventional mean with the smallest asymptotic variance among those that
control for observable adjustment sets that have minimum cost. Our results are
based on the construction of a special flow network associated with the
original causal graph. We show that a minimum cost optimal adjustment set can
be found by computing a maximum flow on the network, and then finding the set
of vertices that are reachable from the source by augmenting paths. The
optimaladj Python package implements the algorithms introduced in this paper.</span>

                    <span>Consider a panel data setting where repeated observations on individuals are
available. Often it is reasonable to assume that there exist groups of
individuals that share similar effects of observed characteristics, but the
grouping is typically unknown in advance. We propose a novel approach to
estimate such unobserved groupings for general panel data models. Our method
explicitly accounts for the uncertainty in individual parameter estimates and
remains computationally feasible with a large number of individuals and/or
repeated measurements on each individual. The developed ideas can be applied
even when individual-level data are not available and only parameter estimates
together with some quantification of uncertainty are given to the researcher.</span>

                    <span>The explicit low-rank regularization, e.g., nuclear norm regularization, has
been widely used in imaging sciences. However, it has been found that implicit
regularization outperforms explicit ones in various image processing tasks.
Another issue is that the fixed explicit regularization limits the
applicability to broad kinds of images since different images favor different
features captured by using different explicit regularizations. As such, this
paper proposes a new adaptive and implicit low-rank regularization that
captures the low-rank prior dynamically from the training data. At the core of
our new adaptive and implicit low-rank regularization is parameterizing the
Laplacian matrix in the Dirichlet energy-based regularization with a neural
network, and we call the proposed model \textit{AIR-Net}. Theoretically, we
show that the adaptive regularization of AIR-Net enhances the implicit
regularization and vanishes at the end of training. We validate AIR-Net&#x27;s
effectiveness on various benchmark tasks, indicating that the AIR-Net is
particularly favorable for the scenarios when the missing entries are
non-uniform. The code can be found at

                    <span>We consider reinforcement learning (RL) in Markov Decision Processes in which
an agent repeatedly interacts with an environment that is modeled by a
controlled Markov process. At each time step $t$, it earns a reward, and also
incurs a cost-vector consisting of $M$ costs. We design model-based RL
algorithms that maximize the cumulative reward earned over a time horizon of
$T$ time-steps, while simultaneously ensuring that the average values of the
$M$ cost expenditures are bounded by agent-specified thresholds
$c^{ub}_i,i&#x3D;1,2,\ldots,M$.

In order to measure the performance of a reinforcement learning algorithm
that satisfies the average cost constraints, we define an $M+1$ dimensional
regret vector that is composed of its reward regret, and $M$ cost regrets. The
reward regret measures the sub-optimality in the cumulative reward, while the
$i$-th component of the cost regret vector is the difference between its $i$-th
cumulative cost expense and the expected cost expenditures $Tc^{ub}_i$.

We prove that the expected value of the regret vector of UCRL-CMDP, is
upper-bounded as $\tilde{O}\left(T^{2\slash 3}\right)$, where $T$ is the time
horizon. We further show how to reduce the regret of a desired subset of the
$M$ costs, at the expense of increasing the regrets of rewards and the
remaining costs. To the best of our knowledge, ours is the only work that
considers non-episodic RL under average cost constraints, and derive algorithms
that can~\emph{tune the regret vector} according to the agent&#x27;s requirements on
its cost regrets.</span>

                    <span>Recent advancements in end-to-end deep learning models have enabled new and intriguing Text-to-Speech (TTS) use-cases with excellent natural-sounding outcomes. However, the majority of these models are trained on large datasets recorded with a single speaker in a professional setting. Expanding solutions to numerous languages and speakers is not viable for everyone in this situation. It is more challenging for low-resource languages not often studied by mainstream research.
 Coqui’s team has designed ‘YourTTS‘ to overcome these limits and provide zero-shot TTS to low-resource languages. It can synthesize voices in various languages and drastically reduce data requirements by transferring information between the training set. Continue Reading....

                    <span>Graph kernel approaches have typically been the most popular strategy for graph classification tasks. Graph kernels can be thought of as functions that measure the similarity of two graphs. They allow kernelized learning algorithms like support vector machines to work directly on charts rather than convert them to fixed-length, real-valued feature vectors through feature extraction. 
 In recent years, the use of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) based on high-performance message-passing neural networks has exploded (MPNNs). As a result, they’ve grown increasingly popular for graph categorization. However, their performance is limited by their hand-crafted combinatorial features. 
 Yale University and IBM researchers propose Kernel Graph Neural Networks (KerGNNs). KerGNNs are frameworks that combine graph kernels and the GNN message-passing procedure into one. They achieve results that are equivalent to cutting-edge approaches. Simultaneously, they vastly increase model interpretability when compared to traditional GNNs. Continue Reading....

                    <span>I am working on a hard sci fi project set several hundred years in the future. I&#x27;d like to show a data scientist running realistic (but interesting) tests on an android to see if it&#x27;s core SNN is intact.
 Ideally, this would be some kind of behavioral simulation, a series of tests that the android has to &quot;pass.&quot;
 Thought I should come to the experts for suggestions!

                    <span>Even though the popularity of JAX is increasing everyday, open sourced code implementations are still hard to find. To counter this, I have created a repository with the goal to achieve something similar to timm for torch (except for the pretrained models because I don&#x27;t have the funds currently).
 Some features of jax_models: 1. Pip installable 2. Weekly / fortnightly model additions 3. Comprehensive tests 4. Model architectures are cross checked by checking original implementations if available or otherwise miscellaneous aspects of the paper such as model parameters
 The repository is currently in its pre-alpha stage with only around 6 model and layer implementations. If you are interested in this, you can contribute by either asking for specific paper implementations or by helping me train and open source weights of these models.
 If you like my work then please consider starring the repository and giving feedback. Thank you!

                    <span>I published a dataset of 5m source code files from 15k open source files. Its long term goal is to enable identifying causality in software engineering. 
 Describing paper: End to End Software Engineering Research
 People from ML, NLP, causality, and software engineering, might find it interesting.
 The dataset enables investigating code similarity (and also text similarity in English), program difficulty, defect predictions, etc.
 The code is extracted every two months in order to investigate the difference. By the difference one can investigate if a change in a possible cause (e.g., smell removal) leads to influence (less bugs)and in which context.
 I plan to keep extending the dataset and would like to get feedback on it - ease of use, new use cases, etc.
 If you have related dataset that can be merged with, related data that you would like to obtain or ideas for research directions, please contact me.

                    <span>Forward: &quot;Bayesian modeling provides an elegant approach to many data science and decision-making problems. However, it can be hard to make it work well in practice. In particular, although there are many software packages that make it easy to specify complex hierarchical models such as Stan, PyMC3, TensorFlow Probability (TFP), and Pyro, users still need additional tools to diagnose whether the results of their computations are correct or not. They may also need advice on what to do when things do go wrong.
 This book focuses on the ArviZ library, which enables users to perform exploratory analysis of Bayesian models, for example, diagnostics of posterior samples generated by any inference method. This can be used to diagnose a variety of failure modes in Bayesian inference. The book also discusses various modeling strategies (such as centering) that can be employed to eliminate many of the most common problems. Most of the examples in the book use PyMC3, although some also use TFP; a brief comparison of other probabilistic programming languages is also included.
 The authors are all experts in the area of Bayesian software and are major contributors to the PyMC3, ArviZ, and TFP libraries. They also have significant experience applying Bayesian data analysis in practice, and this is reflected in the practical approach adopted in this book. Overall, I think this is a valuable addition to the literature, which should hopefully further the adoption of Bayesian methods.&quot;

                    <span>So this is probably a basic question. If the main premise of neural networks is that they are global function approximators, what advantage do they have against other approximators such Fourier transform, which is also proven to be able to approximate any function. Why does not the whole supervised learning field become one of calculating Fourier coefficients

                    <span>My understanding is that if your research paper is denied from a conference, you would take the reviewer&#x27;s feedback, make some changes, then submit to the next big ML conference. The process repeats until the paper is eventually accepted somewhere. But how often is it the case where the paper isn&#x27;t accepted anywhere? How many papers are accepted on the first (or second) try? 
 I&#x27;m an undergrad who&#x27;s really new with the concept of publishing papers, so I thought it&#x27;s worth asking around here. :)

                    <span>In Pay Attention to MLPs, 
  
the authors said that it is necessary for the layer s(&#x27;) to contain a contraction operation over the spatial dimension. It&#x27;s hard to understand why s(&#x27;) should be a contraction operation. I think s(&#x27;) should maintain the spatial dimension for proper calculation. Why should s(&#x27;) be a contraction operation? 
 Can I say transformer dynamically parameterize spatial interactions with positional encoder? I am confused whether spatial interaction already contains the meaning of positional encoding. 
  
What do you think? Thank you in advance.

 Have any of you tried to optimize the neural network using the simulated annealing algorithm?
 I am referring to an example even on a simple neural network because I have a similar project and I will consider how to get started with the topic, so practical use would be extremely helpful ...
 Additionally, some scientific papers or hypothetical examples of use may also be helpful.
 Thanks in advance for your help.

I have tried using Gaussian distribution noise but something doesn&#x27;t work well. I prefer using python to generate them.

                    <span>Graph kernel approaches have typically been the most popular strategy for graph classification tasks. Graph kernels can be thought of as functions that measure the similarity of two graphs. They allow kernelized learning algorithms like support vector machines to work directly on charts rather than convert them to fixed-length, real-valued feature vectors through feature extraction. 
 In recent years, the use of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) based on high-performance message-passing neural networks has exploded (MPNNs). As a result, they’ve grown increasingly popular for graph categorization. However, their performance is limited by their hand-crafted combinatorial features. 
 Yale University and IBM researchers propose Kernel Graph Neural Networks (KerGNNs). KerGNNs are frameworks that combine graph kernels and the GNN message-passing procedure into one. They achieve results that are equivalent to cutting-edge approaches. Simultaneously, they vastly increase model interpretability when compared to traditional GNNs. Continue Reading....

                    <span>I have a dataset of events that take place in football (soccer) games. This is being framed as a reinforcement learning issue by defining episodes to be the events (pass, shoot, dribble, etc) that take place when a team gains possession and loses it (by shooting, losing possession, etc). 
 I have created a simple NN that estimates what the next action will be from the possible action space as a probability distribution. This NN was trained on the historical data from past matches. I would like to know if there are any good pointers into implementing Policy Gradients to nudge the probability distribution learned by the NN in the direction of some reward function that I define. Ideally the advice would be for tensorflow as that is what I am familiar with.

 Can that same nn (with same or similar configuration) also determine a cat from a dog from a range of random animals, assuming weights were adjusted and training redone? Would I need two NN&#x27;s for that?
 Does first NN think it&#x27;s a cat? No? Okay - does 2nd NN think it&#x27;s a dog? Yes!

                    <span>The Covid-19 pandemic has been a scourge upon humanity, claiming the lives of
more than 5 million people worldwide. Although vaccines are being distributed
worldwide, there is an apparent need for affordable screening techniques to
serve parts of the world that do not have access to traditional medicine.
Artificial Intelligence can provide a solution utilizing cough sounds as the
primary screening mode. This paper presents multiple models that have achieved
relatively respectable perfor mance on the largest evaluation dataset currently
presented in academic literature. Moreover, we also show that performance
increases with training data size, showing the need for the world wide
collection of data to help combat the Covid-19 pandemic with non-traditional
means.</span>

                    <span>In this paper, we use support vector machines (SVM) to develop a machine
learning framework to discover phase space structures that distinguish between
distinct reaction pathways. The SVM model is trained using data from
trajectories of Hamilton&#x27;s equations and works well even with relatively few
trajectories. Moreover, this framework is specifically designed to require
minimal a priori knowledge of the dynamics in a system. This makes our approach
computationally better suited than existing methods for high-dimensional
systems and systems where integrating trajectories is expensive. We benchmark
our approach on Chesnavich&#x27;s CH$_4^+$ Hamiltonian.</span>

                    <span>Image denoising is a prerequisite for downstream tasks in many fields.
Low-dose and photon-counting computed tomography (CT) denoising can optimize
diagnostic performance at minimized radiation dose. Supervised deep denoising
methods are popular but require paired clean or noisy samples that are often
unavailable in practice. Limited by the independent noise assumption, current
unsupervised denoising methods cannot process correlated noises as in CT
images. Here we propose the first-of-its-kind similarity-based unsupervised
deep denoising approach, referred to as Noise2Sim, that works in a nonlocal and
nonlinear fashion to suppress not only independent but also correlated noises.
Theoretically, Noise2Sim is asymptotically equivalent to supervised learning
methods under mild conditions. Experimentally, Nosie2Sim recovers intrinsic
features from noisy low-dose CT and photon-counting CT images as effectively as
or even better than supervised learning methods on practical datasets visually,
quantitatively and statistically. Noise2Sim is a general unsupervised denoising
approach and has great potential in diverse applications.</span>

                    <span>An end-to-end communications system based on Orthogonal Frequency Division
Multiplexing (OFDM) is modeled as an autoencoder (AE) for which the transmitter
(coding and modulation) and receiver (demodulation and decoding) are
represented as deep neural networks (DNNs) of the encoder and decoder,
respectively. This AE communications approach is shown to outperform
conventional communications in terms of bit error rate (BER) under practical
scenarios regarding channel and interference effects as well as training data
and embedded implementation constraints. A generative adversarial network (GAN)
is trained to augment the training data when there is not enough training data
available. Also, the performance is evaluated in terms of the DNN model
quantization and the corresponding memory requirements for embedded
implementation. Then, interference training and randomized smoothing are
introduced to train the AE communications to operate under unknown and dynamic
interference (jamming) effects on potentially multiple OFDM symbols. Relative
to conventional communications, up to 36 dB interference suppression for a
channel reuse of four can be achieved by the AE communications with
interference training and randomized smoothing. AE communications is also
extended to the multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) case and its BER
performance gain with and without interference effects is demonstrated compared
to conventional MIMO communications.</span>

                    <span>Formant tracking is investigated in this study by using trackers based on
dynamic programming (DP) and deep neural nets (DNNs). Using the DP approach,
six formant estimation methods were first compared. The six methods include
linear prediction (LP) algorithms, weighted LP algorithms and the recently
developed quasi-closed phase forward-backward (QCP-FB) method. QCP-FB gave the
best performance in the comparison. Therefore, a novel formant tracking
approach, which combines benefits of deep learning and signal processing based
on QCP-FB, was proposed. In this approach, the formants predicted by a
DNN-based tracker from a speech frame are refined using the peaks of the
all-pole spectrum computed by QCP-FB from the same frame. Results show that the
proposed DNN-based tracker performed better both in detection rate and
estimation error for the lowest three formants compared to reference formant
trackers. Compared to the popular Wavesurfer, for example, the proposed tracker
gave a reduction of 29%, 48% and 35% in the estimation error for the lowest
three formants, respectively.</span>

                    <span>Deep learning has achieved great success in many applications. However, its
deployment in practice has been hurdled by two issues: the privacy of data that
has to be aggregated centrally for model training and high communication
overhead due to transmission of a large amount of data usually geographically
distributed. Addressing both issues is challenging and most existing works
could not provide an efficient solution. In this paper, we develop FedPC, a
Federated Deep Learning Framework for Privacy Preservation and Communication
Efficiency. The framework allows a model to be learned on multiple private
datasets while not revealing any information of training data, even with
intermediate data. The framework also minimizes the amount of data exchanged to
update the model. We formally prove the convergence of the learning model when
training with FedPC and its privacy-preserving property. We perform extensive
experiments to evaluate the performance of FedPC in terms of the approximation
to the upper-bound performance (when training centrally) and communication
overhead. The results show that FedPC maintains the performance approximation
of the models within $8.5\%$ of the centrally-trained models when data is
distributed to 10 computing nodes. FedPC also reduces the communication
overhead by up to $42.20\%$ compared to existing works.</span>

                    <span>Advances in deep learning have enabled a wide range of promising
applications. However, these systems are vulnerable to Adversarial Machine
Learning (AML) attacks; adversarially crafted perturbations to their inputs
could cause them to misclassify. Several state-of-the-art adversarial attacks
have demonstrated that they can reliably fool classifiers making these attacks
a significant threat. Adversarial attack generation algorithms focus primarily
on creating successful examples while controlling the noise magnitude and
distribution to make detection more difficult. The underlying assumption of
these attacks is that the adversarial noise is generated offline, making their
execution time a secondary consideration. However, recently, just-in-time
adversarial attacks where an attacker opportunistically generates adversarial
examples on the fly have been shown to be possible. This paper introduces a new
problem: how do we generate adversarial noise under real-time constraints to
support such real-time adversarial attacks? Understanding this problem improves
our understanding of the threat these attacks pose to real-time systems and
provides security evaluation benchmarks for future defenses. Therefore, we
first conduct a run-time analysis of adversarial generation algorithms.
Universal attacks produce a general attack offline, with no online overhead,
and can be applied to any input; however, their success rate is limited because
of their generality. In contrast, online algorithms, which work on a specific
input, are computationally expensive, making them inappropriate for operation
under time constraints. Thus, we propose ROOM, a novel Real-time Online-Offline
attack construction Model where an offline component serves to warm up the
online algorithm, making it possible to generate highly successful attacks
under time constraints.</span>

first main result is based on a geometric construction by Tracy Hall (2004) of
a partial shelling of the cross-polytope which can not be extended. We use it
to derive a maximum class of VC dimension 3 that has no corners. This refutes
several previous works in machine learning from the past 11 years. In
particular, it implies that all previous constructions of optimal unlabeled
sample compression schemes for maximum classes are erroneous.

On the positive side we present a new construction of an unlabeled sample
compression scheme for maximum classes. We leave as open whether our unlabeled
sample compression scheme extends to ample (a.k.a. lopsided or extremal)
classes, which represent a natural and far-reaching generalization of maximum
classes. Towards resolving this question, we provide a geometric
characterization in terms of unique sink orientations of the 1-skeletons of
associated cubical complexes.</span>

                    <span>Deep neural networks have proved hugely successful, achieving human-like
performance on a variety of tasks. However, they are also computationally
expensive, which has motivated the development of model compression techniques
which reduce the resource consumption associated with deep learning models.
Nevertheless, recent studies have suggested that model compression can have an
adverse effect on algorithmic fairness, amplifying existing biases in machine
learning models. With this project we aim to extend those studies to the
context of facial expression recognition. To do that, we set up a neural
network classifier to perform facial expression recognition and implement
several model compression techniques on top of it. We then run experiments on
two facial expression datasets, namely the Extended Cohn-Kanade Dataset (CK+DB)
and the Real-World Affective Faces Database (RAF-DB), to examine the individual
and combined effect that compression techniques have on the model size,
accuracy and fairness. Our experimental results show that: (i) Compression and
quantisation achieve significant reduction in model size with minimal impact on
overall accuracy for both CK+DB and RAF-DB; (ii) in terms of model accuracy,
the classifier trained and tested on RAF-DB seems more robust to compression
compared to the CK+ DB; (iii) for RAF-DB, the different compression strategies
do not seem to increase the gap in predictive performance across the sensitive
attributes of gender, race and age which is in contrast with the results on the
CK+DB, where compression seems to amplify existing biases for gender. We
analyse the results and discuss the potential reasons for our findings.</span>

                    <span>Neural networks are known to be vulnerable to adversarial attacks -- slight
but carefully constructed perturbations of the inputs which can drastically
impair the network&#x27;s performance. Many defense methods have been proposed for
improving robustness of deep networks by training them on adversarially
perturbed inputs. However, these models often remain vulnerable to new types of
attacks not seen during training, and even to slightly stronger versions of
previously seen attacks. In this work, we propose a novel approach to
adversarial robustness, which builds upon the insights from the domain
adaptation field. Our method, called Adversarial Feature Desensitization (AFD),
aims at learning features that are invariant towards adversarial perturbations
of the inputs. This is achieved through a game where we learn features that are
both predictive and robust (insensitive to adversarial attacks), i.e. cannot be
used to discriminate between natural and adversarial data. Empirical results on
several benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach
against a wide range of attack types and attack strengths. Our code is
available at https://github.com/BashivanLab/afd.</span>

                    <span>Recent approaches in literature have exploited the multi-modal information in
documents (text, layout, image) to serve specific downstream document tasks.
However, they are limited by their - (i) inability to learn cross-modal
representations across text, layout and image dimensions for documents and (ii)
inability to process multi-page documents. Pre-training techniques have been
shown in Natural Language Processing (NLP) domain to learn generic textual
representations from large unlabelled datasets, applicable to various
downstream NLP tasks. In this paper, we propose a multi-task learning-based
framework that utilizes a combination of self-supervised and supervised
pre-training tasks to learn a generic document representation applicable to
various downstream document tasks. Specifically, we introduce Document Topic
Modelling and Document Shuffle Prediction as novel pre-training tasks to learn
rich image representations along with the text and layout representations for
documents. We utilize the Longformer network architecture as the backbone to
encode the multi-modal information from multi-page documents in an end-to-end
fashion. We showcase the applicability of our pre-training framework on a
variety of different real-world document tasks such as document classification,
document information extraction, and document retrieval. We evaluate our
framework on different standard document datasets and conduct exhaustive
experiments to compare performance against various ablations of our framework
and state-of-the-art baselines.</span>

                    <span>The machine learning (ML) life cycle involves a series of iterative steps,
from the effective gathering and preparation of the data, including complex
feature engineering processes, to the presentation and improvement of results,
with various algorithms to choose from in every step. Feature engineering in
particular can be very beneficial for ML, leading to numerous improvements such
as boosting the predictive results, decreasing computational times, reducing
excessive noise, and increasing the transparency behind the decisions taken
during the training. Despite that, while several visual analytics tools exist
to monitor and control the different stages of the ML life cycle (especially
those related to data and algorithms), feature engineering support remains
inadequate. In this paper, we present FeatureEnVi, a visual analytics system
specifically designed to assist with the feature engineering process. Our
proposed system helps users to choose the most important feature, to transform
the original features into powerful alternatives, and to experiment with
different feature generation combinations. Additionally, data space slicing
allows users to explore the impact of features on both local and global scales.
FeatureEnVi utilizes multiple automatic feature selection techniques;
furthermore, it visually guides users with statistical evidence about the
influence of each feature (or subsets of features). The final outcome is the
extraction of heavily engineered features, evaluated by multiple validation
metrics. The usefulness and applicability of FeatureEnVi are demonstrated with
two use cases and a case study. We also report feedback from interviews with
two ML experts and a visualization researcher who assessed the effectiveness of
our system.</span>

Federated Learning (OARF), a benchmark suite for federated machine learning
systems. Previously available benchmarks for federated learning have focused
mainly on synthetic datasets and use a limited number of applications. OARF
mimics more realistic application scenarios with publicly available data sets
as different data silos in image, text and structured data. Our
characterization shows that the benchmark suite is diverse in data size,
distribution, feature distribution and learning task complexity. The extensive
evaluations with reference implementations show the future research
opportunities for important aspects of federated learning systems. We have
developed reference implementations, and evaluated the important aspects of
federated learning, including model accuracy, communication cost, throughput
and convergence time. Through these evaluations, we discovered some interesting
findings such as federated learning can effectively increase end-to-end

catastrophic forgetting and tend to only perform well on tasks that they were
recently trained on. In this work we explore the application of latent space

                    <span>We consider a matrix completion problem that exploits social or item
similarity graphs as side information. We develop a universal, parameter-free,
and computationally efficient algorithm that starts with hierarchical graph
clustering and then iteratively refines estimates both on graph clustering and
matrix ratings. Under a hierarchical stochastic block model that well respects
practically-relevant social graphs and a low-rank rating matrix model (to be
detailed), we demonstrate that our algorithm achieves the information-theoretic
limit on the number of observed matrix entries (i.e., optimal sample
complexity) that is derived by maximum likelihood estimation together with a
lower-bound impossibility result. One consequence of this result is that
exploiting the hierarchical structure of social graphs yields a substantial
gain in sample complexity relative to the one that simply identifies different
groups without resorting to the relational structure across them. We conduct
extensive experiments both on synthetic and real-world datasets to corroborate
our theoretical results as well as to demonstrate significant performance
improvements over other matrix completion algorithms that leverage graph side
information.</span>

                    <span>The Searching on Sorted Data ({\bf SOSD}, in short) is a highly engineered
software platform for benchmarking Learned Indexes, those latter being a novel
and quite effective proposal of how to search in a sorted table by combining
Machine Learning techniques with classic Algorithms. In such a platform and in
the related benchmarking experiments, following a natural and intuitive choice,
the final search stage is performed via the Standard (textbook) Binary Search
procedure. However, recent studies, that do not use Machine Learning
predictions, indicate that Uniform Binary Search, streamlined to avoid
\vir{branching} in the main loop, is superior in performance to its Standard
counterpart when the table to be searched into is relatively small, e.g.,
fitting in L1 or L2 cache. Analogous results hold for k-ary Search, even on
large tables. One would expect an analogous behaviour within Learned Indexes.
Via a set of extensive experiments, coherent with the State of the Art, we show
that for Learned Indexes, and as far as the {\bf SOSD} software is concerned,
the use of the Standard routine (either Binary or k-ary Search) is superior to
the Uniform one, across all the internal memory levels. This fact provides a
quantitative justification of the natural choice made so far. Our experiments
also indicate that Uniform Binary and k-ary Search can be advantageous to use
in order to save space in Learned Indexes, while granting a good performance in
time. Our findings are of methodological relevance for this novel and
fast-growing area and informative to practitioners interested in using Learned
Indexes in application domains, e.g., Data Bases and Search Engines.</span>

                    <span>Adversarial attacks make their success in &quot;fooling&quot; DNNs and among them,
gradient-based algorithms become one of the mainstreams. Based on the linearity
hypothesis [12], under $\ell_\infty$ constraint, $sign$ operation applied to
the gradients is a good choice for generating perturbations. However, the
side-effect from such operation exists since it leads to the bias of direction
between the real gradients and the perturbations. In other words, current
methods contain a gap between real gradients and actual noises, which leads to
biased and inefficient attacks. Therefore in this paper, based on the Taylor
expansion, the bias is analyzed theoretically and the correction of $\sign$,
i.e., Fast Gradient Non-sign Method (FGNM), is further proposed. Notably, FGNM
is a general routine, which can seamlessly replace the conventional $sign$
operation in gradient-based attacks with negligible extra computational cost.
Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods.
Specifically, ours outperform them by \textbf{27.5\%} at most and
\textbf{9.5\%} on average. Our anonymous code is publicly available:

                    <span>It has been argued by Thom and Palm that sparsely-connected neural networks
(SCNs) show improved performance over fully-connected networks (FCNs).
Super-regular networks (SRNs) are neural networks composed of a set of stacked
sparse layers of (epsilon, delta)-super-regular pairs, and randomly permuted
node order. Using the Blow-up Lemma, we prove that as a result of the
individual super-regularity of each pair of layers, SRNs guarantee a number of
properties that make them suitable replacements for FCNs for many tasks. These
guarantees include edge uniformity across all large-enough subsets, minimum
node in- and out-degree, input-output sensitivity, and the ability to embed
pre-trained constructs. Indeed, SRNs have the capacity to act like FCNs, and
eliminate the need for costly regularization schemes like Dropout. We show that
SRNs perform similarly to X-Nets via readily reproducible experiments, and
offer far greater guarantees and control over network structure.</span>

                    <span>In recent years, deep learning has successfully been applied to automate a
wide variety of tasks in diagnostic histopathology. However, fast and reliable
localization of small-scale regions-of-interest (ROI) has remained a key
challenge, as discriminative morphologic features often occupy only a small
fraction of a gigapixel-scale whole-slide image (WSI). In this paper, we
propose a sparse WSI analysis method for the rapid identification of high-power
ROI for WSI-level classification. We develop an evaluation framework inspired
by the early classification literature, in order to quantify the tradeoff
between diagnostic performance and inference time for sparse analytic
approaches. We test our method on a common but time-consuming task in pathology
- that of diagnosing gastric intestinal metaplasia (GIM) on hematoxylin and
eosin (H&amp;E)-stained slides from endoscopic biopsy specimens. GIM is a
well-known precursor lesion along the pathway to development of gastric cancer.
We performed a thorough evaluation of the performance and inference time of our
approach on a test set of GIM-positive and GIM-negative WSI, finding that our
method successfully detects GIM in all positive WSI, with a WSI-level
classification area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of
0.98 and an average precision (AP) of 0.95. Furthermore, we show that our
method can attain these metrics in under one minute on a standard CPU. Our
results are applicable toward the goal of developing neural networks that can
easily be deployed in clinical settings to support pathologists in quickly
localizing and diagnosing small-scale morphologic features in WSI.</span>

                    <span>High-quality estimates of uncertainty and robustness are crucial for numerous
real-world applications, especially for deep learning which underlies many
deployed ML systems. The ability to compare techniques for improving these
estimates is therefore very important for research and practice alike. Yet,
competitive comparisons of methods are often lacking due to a range of reasons,
including: compute availability for extensive tuning, incorporation of
sufficiently many baselines, and concrete documentation for reproducibility. In
this paper we introduce Uncertainty Baselines: high-quality implementations of
standard and state-of-the-art deep learning methods on a variety of tasks. As
of this writing, the collection spans 19 methods across 9 tasks, each with at
least 5 metrics. Each baseline is a self-contained experiment pipeline with
easily reusable and extendable components. Our goal is to provide immediate
starting points for experimentation with new methods or applications.
Additionally we provide model checkpoints, experiment outputs as Python
notebooks, and leaderboards for comparing results. Code available at

                    <span>Feature selection, as a vital dimension reduction technique, reduces data
dimension by identifying an essential subset of input features, which can
facilitate interpretable insights into learning and inference processes.
Algorithmic stability is a key characteristic of an algorithm regarding its
sensitivity to perturbations of input samples. In this paper, we propose an
innovative unsupervised feature selection algorithm attaining this stability
with provable guarantees. The architecture of our algorithm consists of a
feature scorer and a feature selector. The scorer trains a neural network (NN)
to globally score all the features, and the selector adopts a dependent sub-NN
to locally evaluate the representation abilities for selecting features.
Further, we present algorithmic stability analysis and show that our algorithm
has a performance guarantee via a generalization error bound. Extensive
experimental results on real-world datasets demonstrate superior generalization
performance of our proposed algorithm to strong baseline methods. Also, the
properties revealed by our theoretical analysis and the stability of our
algorithm-selected features are empirically confirmed.</span>

                    <span>This paper proposes a method for modeling human driver interactions that
relies on multi-output gaussian processes. The proposed method is developed as
a refinement of the game theoretical hierarchical reasoning approach called
&quot;level-k reasoning&quot; which conventionally assigns discrete levels of behaviors
to agents. Although it is shown to be an effective modeling tool, the level-k
reasoning approach may pose undesired constraints for predicting human decision
making due to a limited number (usually 2 or 3) of driver policies it extracts.
The proposed approach is put forward to fill this gap in the literature by
introducing a continuous domain framework that enables an infinite policy
space. By using the approach presented in this paper, more accurate driver
models can be obtained, which can then be employed for creating high fidelity
simulation platforms for the validation of autonomous vehicle control
algorithms. The proposed method is validated on a real traffic dataset and
compared with the conventional level-k approach to demonstrate its
contributions and implications.</span>

                    <span>Audio-based automatic speech recognition (ASR) degrades significantly in
noisy environments and is particularly vulnerable to interfering speech, as the
model cannot determine which speaker to transcribe. Audio-visual speech
recognition (AVSR) systems improve robustness by complementing the audio stream
with the visual information that is invariant to noise and helps the model
focus on the desired speaker. However, previous AVSR work focused solely on the
supervised learning setup; hence the progress was hindered by the amount of
labeled data available. In this work, we present a self-supervised AVSR
framework built upon Audio-Visual HuBERT (AV-HuBERT), a state-of-the-art
audio-visual speech representation learning model. On the largest available
AVSR benchmark dataset LRS3, our approach outperforms prior state-of-the-art by
~50% (28.0% vs. 14.1%) using less than 10% of labeled data (433hr vs. 30hr) in
the presence of babble noise, while reducing the WER of an audio-based model by
over 75% (25.8% vs. 5.8%) on average.</span>

                    <span>State-of-the-art machine learning models are routinely trained on large-scale
distributed clusters. Crucially, such systems can be compromised when some of
the computing devices exhibit abnormal (Byzantine) behavior and return
arbitrary results to the parameter server (PS). This behavior may be attributed
to a plethora of reasons, including system failures and orchestrated attacks.
Existing work suggests robust aggregation and/or computational redundancy to
alleviate the effect of distorted gradients. However, most of these schemes are
ineffective when an adversary knows the task assignment and can choose the
attacked workers judiciously to induce maximal damage. Our proposed method
Aspis assigns gradient computations to worker nodes using a subset-based
assignment which allows for multiple consistency checks on the behavior of a
worker node. Examination of the calculated gradients and post-processing
(clique-finding in an appropriately constructed graph) by the central node
allows for efficient detection and subsequent exclusion of adversaries from the
training process. We prove the Byzantine resilience and detection guarantees of
Aspis under weak and strong attacks and extensively evaluate the system on
various large-scale training scenarios. The principal metric for our
experiments is the test accuracy, for which we demonstrate a significant
improvement of about 30% compared to many state-of-the-art approaches on the
CIFAR-10 dataset. The corresponding reduction of the fraction of corrupted
gradients ranges from 16% to 99%.</span>

                    <span>Permeability has a dominant influence on the flow properties of a natural
fluid. Lattice Boltzmann simulator determines permeability from the nano and
micropore network. The simulator holds millions of flow dynamics calculations
with its accumulated errors and high consumption of computing power. To
efficiently and consistently predict permeability, we propose a morphology
decoder, a parallel and serial flow reconstruction of machine learning
segmented heterogeneous Cretaceous texture from 3D micro computerized
tomography and nuclear magnetic resonance images. For 3D vision, we introduce
controllable-measurable-volume as new supervised segmentation, in which a
unique set of voxel intensity corresponds to grain and pore throat sizes. The
morphology decoder demarks and aggregates the morphologies boundaries in a
novel way to produce permeability. Morphology decoder method consists of five
novel processes, which describes in this paper, these novel processes are: (1)
Geometrical 3D Permeability, (2) Machine Learning guided 3D Properties
Recognition of Rock Morphology, (3) 3D Image Properties Integration Model for
Permeability, (4) MRI Permeability Imager, and (5) Morphology Decoder (the
process that integrates the other four novel processes).</span>

                    <span>While advances in multi-agent learning have enabled the training of
increasingly complex agents, most existing techniques produce a final policy
that is not designed to adapt to a new partner&#x27;s strategy. However, we would
like our AI agents to adjust their strategy based on the strategies of those
around them. In this work, we study the problem of conditional multi-agent
imitation learning, where we have access to joint trajectory demonstrations at
training time, and we must interact with and adapt to new partners at test
time. This setting is challenging because we must infer a new partner&#x27;s
strategy and adapt our policy to that strategy, all without knowledge of the
environment reward or dynamics. We formalize this problem of conditional
multi-agent imitation learning, and propose a novel approach to address the
difficulties of scalability and data scarcity. Our key insight is that
variations across partners in multi-agent games are often highly structured,
and can be represented via a low-rank subspace. Leveraging tools from tensor
decomposition, our model learns a low-rank subspace over ego and partner agent
strategies, then infers and adapts to a new partner strategy by interpolating
in the subspace. We experiments with a mix of collaborative tasks, including
bandits, particle, and Hanabi environments. Additionally, we test our
conditional policies against real human partners in a user study on the
Overcooked game. Our model adapts better to new partners compared to baselines,
and robustly handles diverse settings ranging from discrete/continuous actions
and static/online evaluation with AI/human partners.</span>

                    <span>Neural generative models can be used to learn complex probability
distributions from data, to sample from them, and to produce probability
density estimates. We propose a computational framework for developing neural
generative models inspired by the theory of predictive processing in the brain.
According to predictive processing theory, the neurons in the brain form a
hierarchy in which neurons in one level form expectations about sensory inputs
from another level. These neurons update their local models based on
differences between their expectations and the observed signals. In a similar
way, artificial neurons in our generative models predict what neighboring
neurons will do, and adjust their parameters based on how well the predictions
matched reality. In this work, we show that the neural generative models
learned within our framework perform well in practice across several benchmark
datasets and metrics and either remain competitive with or significantly
outperform other generative models with similar functionality (such as the
variational auto-encoder).</span>

                    <span>Artificial intelligence (AI) has become a part of everyday conversation and
our lives. It is considered as the new electricity that is revolutionizing the
world. AI is heavily invested in both industry and academy. However, there is
also a lot of hype in the current AI debate. AI based on so-called deep
learning has achieved impressive results in many problems, but its limits are
already visible. AI has been under research since the 1940s, and the industry
has seen many ups and downs due to over-expectations and related
disappointments that have followed.

The purpose of this book is to give a realistic picture of AI, its history,
its potential and limitations. We believe that AI is a helper, not a ruler of
humans. We begin by describing what AI is and how it has evolved over the
decades. After fundamentals, we explain the importance of massive data for the
current mainstream of artificial intelligence. The most common representations
for AI, methods, and machine learning are covered. In addition, the main
application areas are introduced. Computer vision has been central to the
development of AI. The book provides a general introduction to computer vision,
and includes an exposure to the results and applications of our own research.
Emotions are central to human intelligence, but little use has been made in AI.
We present the basics of emotional intelligence and our own research on the
topic. We discuss super-intelligence that transcends human understanding,
explaining why such achievement seems impossible on the basis of present
knowledge,and how AI could be improved. Finally, a summary is made of the
current state of AI and what to do in the future. In the appendix, we look at
the development of AI education, especially from the perspective of contents at
our own university.</span>

                    <span>Learning to solve combinatorial optimization problems, such as the vehicle
routing problem, offers great computational advantages over classical
operations research solvers and heuristics. The recently developed deep
reinforcement learning approaches either improve an initially given solution
iteratively or sequentially construct a set of individual tours. However, most
of the existing learning-based approaches are not able to work for a fixed
number of vehicles and thus bypass the complex assignment problem of the
customers onto an apriori given number of available vehicles. On the other
hand, this makes them less suitable for real applications, as many logistic
service providers rely on solutions provided for a specific bounded fleet size
and cannot accommodate short term changes to the number of vehicles. In
contrast we propose a powerful supervised deep learning framework that
constructs a complete tour plan from scratch while respecting an apriori fixed
number of available vehicles. In combination with an efficient post-processing
scheme, our supervised approach is not only much faster and easier to train but
also achieves competitive results that incorporate the practical aspect of
vehicle costs. In thorough controlled experiments we compare our method to
multiple state-of-the-art approaches where we demonstrate stable performance,
while utilizing less vehicles and shed some light on existent inconsistencies
in the experimentation protocols of the related work.</span>

                    <span>Biomedical research is growing in such an exponential pace that scientists,
researchers and practitioners are no more able to cope with the amount of
published literature in the domain. The knowledge presented in the literature
needs to be systematized in such a ways that claims and hypothesis can be
easily found, accessed and validated. Knowledge graphs can provide such
framework for semantic knowledge representation from literature. However, in
order to build knowledge graph, it is necessary to extract knowledge in form of
relationships between biomedical entities and normalize both entities and
relationship types. In this paper, we present and compare few rule-based and
machine learning-based (Naive Bayes, Random Forests as examples of traditional
machine learning methods and T5-based model as an example of modern deep
learning) methods for scalable relationship extraction from biomedical
literature for the integration into the knowledge graphs. We examine how
resilient are these various methods to unbalanced and fairly small datasets,
showing that T5 model handles well both small datasets, due to its pre-training
on large C4 dataset as well as unbalanced data. The best performing model was
T5 model fine-tuned on balanced data, with reported F1-score of 0.88.</span>

                    <span>Generative adversarial networks (GANs) with clustered latent spaces can
perform conditional generation in a completely unsupervised manner. In the real
world, the salient attributes of unlabeled data can be imbalanced. However,
most of existing unsupervised conditional GANs cannot cluster attributes of
these data in their latent spaces properly because they assume uniform
distributions of the attributes. To address this problem, we theoretically
derive Stein latent optimization that provides reparameterizable gradient
estimations of the latent distribution parameters assuming a Gaussian mixture
prior in a continuous latent space. Structurally, we introduce an encoder
network and novel unsupervised conditional contrastive loss to ensure that data
generated from a single mixture component represent a single attribute. We
confirm that the proposed method, named Stein Latent Optimization for GANs
(SLOGAN), successfully learns balanced or imbalanced attributes and achieves
state-of-the-art unsupervised conditional generation performance even in the
absence of attribute information (e.g., the imbalance ratio). Moreover, we
demonstrate that the attributes to be learned can be manipulated using a small
amount of probe data.</span>

objects -- has emerged as a promising avenue for characterizing the dark matter
population in our Galaxy. By leveraging recent advances in simulation-based
inference and neural network architectures, we introduce a novel method to
search for global dark matter-induced gravitational lensing signatures in
astrometric datasets. Our method based on neural likelihood-ratio estimation
shows significantly enhanced sensitivity to a cold dark matter population and
more favorable scaling with measurement noise compared to existing approaches
based on two-point correlation statistics. We demonstrate the real-world
viability of our method by showing it to be robust to non-trivial modeled as
well as unmodeled noise features expected in astrometric measurements. This
establishes machine learning as a powerful tool for characterizing dark matter
using astrometric data.</span>

reproduce the TryOnGAN implementation and probe it along diverse angles: impact
of transfer learning, variants of conditioning image generation with poses and
properties of latent space interpolation. Some of these facets have never been
explored in literature earlier. We find that transfer helps training initially
but gains are lost as models train longer and pose conditioning via

                    <span>Due to the success of deep learning (DL) and its growing job market, students
and researchers from many areas are interested in learning about DL
technologies. Visualization has proven to be of great help during this learning
process. While most current educational visualizations are targeted towards one
specific architecture or use case, recurrent neural networks (RNNs), which are
capable of processing sequential data, are not covered yet. This is despite the
fact that tasks on sequential data, such as text and function analysis, are at
the forefront of DL research. Therefore, we propose exploRNN, the first
interactively explorable educational visualization for RNNs. On the basis of
making learning easier and more fun, we define educational objectives targeted
towards understanding RNNs. We use these objectives to form guidelines for the
visual design process. By means of exploRNN, which is accessible online, we
provide an overview of the training process of RNNs at a coarse level, while
also allowing a detailed inspection of the data flow within LSTM cells. In an
empirical study, we assessed 37 subjects in a between-subjects design to
investigate the learning outcomes and cognitive load of exploRNN compared to a
classic text-based learning environment. While learners in the text group are
ahead in superficial knowledge acquisition, exploRNN is particularly helpful
for deeper understanding of the learning content. In addition, the complex
content in exploRNN is perceived as significantly easier and causes less
extraneous load than in the text group. The study shows that for difficult
learning material such as recurrent networks, where deep understanding is
important, interactive visualizations such as exploRNN can be helpful.</span>

                    <span>Knowledge Graph Embedding (KGE) aims to learn representations for entities
and relations. Most KGE models have gained great success, especially on
extrapolation scenarios. Specifically, given an unseen triple (h, r, t), a
trained model can still correctly predict t from (h, r, ?), or h from (?, r,
t), such extrapolation ability is impressive. However, most existing KGE works
focus on the design of delicate triple modeling function, which mainly tells us
how to measure the plausibility of observed triples, but offers limited
explanation of why the methods can extrapolate to unseen data, and what are the
important factors to help KGE extrapolate. Therefore in this work, we attempt
to study the KGE extrapolation of two problems: 1. How does KGE extrapolate to
unseen data? 2. How to design the KGE model with better extrapolation ability?
For the problem 1, we first discuss the impact factors for extrapolation and
from relation, entity and triple level respectively, propose three Semantic
Evidences (SEs), which can be observed from train set and provide important
semantic information for extrapolation. Then we verify the effectiveness of SEs
through extensive experiments on several typical KGE methods. For the problem
2, to make better use of the three levels of SE, we propose a novel GNN-based
KGE model, called Semantic Evidence aware Graph Neural Network (SE-GNN). In
SE-GNN, each level of SE is modeled explicitly by the corresponding neighbor
pattern, and merged sufficiently by the multi-layer aggregation, which
contributes to obtaining more extrapolative knowledge representation. Finally,
through extensive experiments on FB15k-237 and WN18RR datasets, we show that
SE-GNN achieves state-of-the-art performance on Knowledge Graph Completion task
and performs a better extrapolation ability.</span>

                    <span>We argue the Fisher information matrix (FIM) of one hidden layer networks
with the ReLU activation function. Let $W$ denote the $d \times p$ weight
matrix from the $d$-dimensional input to the hidden layer consisting of $p$
neurons, and $v$ the $p$-dimensional weight vector from the hidden layer to the
scalar output. We focus on the FIM of $v$, which we denote as $I$. When $p$ is
large, under certain conditions, the following approximately holds. 1) There
are three major clusters in the eigenvalue distribution. 2) Since $I$ is
non-negative owing to the ReLU, the first eigenvalue is the Perron-Frobenius
eigenvalue. 3) For the cluster of the next maximum values, the eigenspace is
spanned by the row vectors of $W$. 4) The direct sum of the eigenspace of the
first eigenvalue and that of the third cluster is spanned by the set of all the
vectors obtained as the Hadamard product of any pair of the row vectors of $W$.
We confirmed by numerical simulation that the above is approximately correct
when the number of hidden nodes is about 10000.</span>

                    <span>This work studies the bias issue of pseudo-labeling, a natural phenomenon
that widely occurs but often overlooked by prior research. Pseudo-labels are
generated when a classifier trained on source data is transferred to unlabeled
target data. We observe heavy long-tailed pseudo-labels when a semi-supervised
learning model FixMatch predicts labels on the unlabeled set even though the
unlabeled data is curated to be balanced. Without intervention, the training
model inherits the bias from the pseudo-labels and end up being sub-optimal. To
eliminate the model bias, we propose a simple yet effective method DebiasMatch,
comprising of an adaptive debiasing module and an adaptive marginal loss. The
strength of debiasing and the size of margins can be automatically adjusted by
making use of an online updated queue. Benchmarked on ImageNet-1K, DebiasMatch
significantly outperforms previous state-of-the-arts by more than 26% and 8.7%
on semi-supervised learning (0.2% annotated data) and zero-shot learning tasks

                    <span>Feature selection reduces the dimensionality of data by identifying a subset
of the most informative features. In this paper, we propose an innovative
framework for unsupervised feature selection, called fractal autoencoders
(FAE). It trains a neural network to pinpoint informative features for global
exploring of representability and for local excavating of diversity.
Architecturally, FAE extends autoencoders by adding a one-to-one scoring layer
and a small sub-neural network for feature selection in an unsupervised
fashion. With such a concise architecture, FAE achieves state-of-the-art
performances; extensive experimental results on fourteen datasets, including
very high-dimensional data, have demonstrated the superiority of FAE over
existing contemporary methods for unsupervised feature selection. In
particular, FAE exhibits substantial advantages on gene expression data
exploration, reducing measurement cost by about $15$\% over the widely used
L1000 landmark genes. Further, we show that the FAE framework is easily
extensible with an application.</span>

                    <span>GPUs are widely used to accelerate the training of machine learning
workloads. As modern machine learning models become increasingly larger, they
require a longer time to train, leading to higher GPU energy consumption. This
paper presents GPOEO, an online GPU energy optimization framework for machine
learning training workloads. GPOEO dynamically determines the optimal energy
configuration by employing novel techniques for online measurement,
multi-objective prediction modeling, and search optimization. To characterize
the target workload behavior, GPOEO utilizes GPU performance counters. To
reduce the performance counter profiling overhead, it uses an analytical model
to detect the training iteration change and only collects performance counter
data when an iteration shift is detected. GPOEO employs multi-objective models
based on gradient boosting and a local search algorithm to find a trade-off
between execution time and energy consumption. We evaluate the GPOEO by
applying it to 71 machine learning workloads from two AI benchmark suites
running on an NVIDIA RTX3080Ti GPU. Compared with the NVIDIA default scheduling
strategy, GPOEO delivers a mean energy saving of 16.2% with a modest average
execution time increase of 5.1%.</span>

                    <span>In model-free deep reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms, using noisy value
estimates to supervise policy evaluation and optimization is detrimental to the
sample efficiency. As this noise is heteroscedastic, its effects can be
mitigated using uncertainty-based weights in the optimization process. Previous
methods rely on sampled ensembles, which do not capture all aspects of
uncertainty. We provide a systematic analysis of the sources of uncertainty in
the noisy supervision that occurs in RL, and introduce inverse-variance RL, a
Bayesian framework which combines probabilistic ensembles and Batch Inverse
Variance weighting. We propose a method whereby two complementary uncertainty
estimation methods account for both the Q-value and the environment
stochasticity to better mitigate the negative impacts of noisy supervision. Our
results show significant improvement in terms of sample efficiency on discrete

                    <span>A common approach to solving tasks, such as node classification or link
prediction, on a large network begins by learning a Euclidean embedding of the
nodes of the network, from which regular machine learning methods can be
applied. For unsupervised random walk methods such as DeepWalk and node2vec,
adding a $\ell_2$ penalty on the embedding vectors to the loss leads to
improved downstream task performance. In this paper we study the effects of
this regularization and prove that, under exchangeability assumptions on the
graph, it asymptotically leads to learning a nuclear-norm-type penalized
graphon. In particular, the exact form of the penalty depends on the choice of
subsampling method used within stochastic gradient descent to learn the
embeddings. We also illustrate empirically that concatenating node covariates
to $\ell_2$ regularized node2vec embeddings leads to comparable, if not
superior, performance to methods which incorporate node covariates and the
network structure in a non-linear manner.</span>

for compact $U \subset \R^D$ with $D\geq 2$, the measure-preserving neural
networks are able to approximate arbitrary measure-preserving map $\psi: U\to

health and survival, which contains physical, functional, and biological
variables, and is conditioned on demographic, lifestyle, and medical background
information. We combine techniques of modern machine learning with an
interpretable interaction network, where health variables are coupled by
explicit pair-wise interactions within a stochastic dynamical system. Our
dynamic joint interpretable network (DJIN) model is scalable to large
longitudinal data sets, is predictive of individual high-dimensional health
trajectories and survival from baseline health states, and infers an
interpretable network of directed interactions between the health variables.
The network identifies plausible physiological connections between health
variables as well as clusters of strongly connected health variables. We use
English Longitudinal Study of Aging (ELSA) data to train our model and show
that it performs better than multiple dedicated linear models for health
outcomes and survival. We compare our model with flexible lower-dimensional
latent-space models to explore the dimensionality required to accurately model
aging health outcomes. Our DJIN model can be used to generate synthetic
individuals that age realistically, to impute missing data, and to simulate
future aging outcomes given arbitrary initial health states.</span>

                    <span>Deep reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms are predominantly evaluated by
comparing their relative performance on a large suite of tasks. Most published
results on deep RL benchmarks compare point estimates of aggregate performance
such as mean and median scores across tasks, ignoring the statistical
uncertainty implied by the use of a finite number of training runs. Beginning
with the Arcade Learning Environment (ALE), the shift towards
computationally-demanding benchmarks has led to the practice of evaluating only
a small number of runs per task, exacerbating the statistical uncertainty in
point estimates. In this paper, we argue that reliable evaluation in the few
run deep RL regime cannot ignore the uncertainty in results without running the
risk of slowing down progress in the field. We illustrate this point using a
case study on the Atari 100k benchmark, where we find substantial discrepancies
between conclusions drawn from point estimates alone versus a more thorough
statistical analysis. With the aim of increasing the field&#x27;s confidence in
reported results with a handful of runs, we advocate for reporting interval
estimates of aggregate performance and propose performance profiles to account
for the variability in results, as well as present more robust and efficient
aggregate metrics, such as interquartile mean scores, to achieve small
uncertainty in results. Using such statistical tools, we scrutinize performance
evaluations of existing algorithms on other widely used RL benchmarks including
the ALE, Procgen, and the DeepMind Control Suite, again revealing discrepancies
in prior comparisons. Our findings call for a change in how we evaluate
performance in deep RL, for which we present a more rigorous evaluation
methodology, accompanied with an open-source library rliable, to prevent
unreliable results from stagnating the field.</span>

                    <span>Deep neural networks (DNNs) are notorious for making more mistakes for the
classes that have substantially fewer samples than the others during training.
Such class imbalance is ubiquitous in clinical applications and very crucial to
handle because the classes with fewer samples most often correspond to critical
cases (e.g., cancer) where misclassifications can have severe consequences. Not
to miss such cases, binary classifiers need to be operated at high True
Positive Rates (TPRs) by setting a higher threshold, but this comes at the cost
of very high False Positive Rates (FPRs) for problems with class imbalance.
Existing methods for learning under class imbalance most often do not take this
into account. We argue that prediction accuracy should be improved by
emphasizing reducing FPRs at high TPRs for problems where misclassification of
the positive, i.e. critical, class samples are associated with higher cost. To
this end, we pose the training of a DNN for binary classification as a
constrained optimization problem and introduce a novel constraint that can be
used with existing loss functions to enforce maximal area under the ROC curve
(AUC) through prioritizing FPR reduction at high TPR. We solve the resulting
constrained optimization problem using an Augmented Lagrangian method (ALM).
Going beyond binary, we also propose two possible extensions of the proposed
constraint for multi-class classification problems. We present experimental
results for image-based binary and multi-class classification applications
using an in-house medical imaging dataset, CIFAR10, and CIFAR100. Our results
demonstrate that the proposed method improves the baselines in majority of the
cases by attaining higher accuracy on critical classes while reducing the
misclassification rate for the non-critical class samples.</span>

                    <span>Software often produces biased outputs. In particular, machine learning (ML)
based software are known to produce erroneous predictions when processing
discriminatory inputs. Such unfair program behavior can be caused by societal
bias. In the last few years, Amazon, Microsoft and Google have provided
software services that produce unfair outputs, mostly due to societal bias
(e.g. gender or race). In such events, developers are saddled with the task of
conducting fairness testing. Fairness testing is challenging; developers are
tasked with generating discriminatory inputs that reveal and explain biases.

We propose a grammar-based fairness testing approach (called ASTRAEA) which
leverages context-free grammars to generate discriminatory inputs that reveal
fairness violations in software systems. Using probabilistic grammars, ASTRAEA
also provides fault diagnosis by isolating the cause of observed software bias.
ASTRAEA&#x27;s diagnoses facilitate the improvement of ML fairness.

ASTRAEA was evaluated on 18 software systems that provide three major natural
language processing (NLP) services. In our evaluation, ASTRAEA generated
fairness violations with a rate of ~18%. ASTRAEA generated over 573K
discriminatory test cases and found over 102K fairness violations. Furthermore,
ASTRAEA improves software fairness by ~76%, via model-retraining.</span>

                    <span>The exemplar-free class incremental learning requires classification models
to learn new class knowledge incrementally without retaining any old samples.
Recently, the framework based on parallel one-class classifiers (POC), which
trains a one-class classifier (OCC) independently for each category, has
attracted extensive attention, since it can naturally avoid catastrophic
forgetting. POC, however, suffers from weak discriminability and comparability
due to its independent training strategy for different OOCs. To meet this
challenge, we propose a new framework, named Discriminative and Comparable
One-class classifiers for Incremental Learning (DisCOIL). DisCOIL follows the
basic principle of POC, but it adopts variational auto-encoders (VAE) instead
of other well-established one-class classifiers (e.g. deep SVDD), because a
trained VAE can not only identify the probability of an input sample belonging
to a class but also generate pseudo samples of the class to assist in learning
new tasks. With this advantage, DisCOIL trains a new-class VAE in contrast with
the old-class VAEs, which forces the new-class VAE to reconstruct better for
new-class samples but worse for the old-class pseudo samples, thus enhancing
the comparability. Furthermore, DisCOIL introduces a hinge reconstruction loss
to ensure the discriminability. We evaluate our method extensively on MNIST,
CIFAR10, and Tiny-ImageNet. The experimental results show that DisCOIL achieves
state-of-the-art performance.</span>

                    <span>Cloud computing has become a major approach to enable reproducible
computational experiments because of its support of on-demand hardware and
software resource provisioning. Yet there are still two main difficulties in
reproducing big data applications in the cloud. The first is how to automate
end-to-end execution of big data analytics in the cloud including virtual
distributed environment provisioning, network and security group setup, and big
data analytics pipeline description and execution. The second is an application
developed for one cloud, such as AWS or Azure, is difficult to reproduce in
another cloud, a.k.a. vendor lock-in problem. To tackle these problems, we
leverage serverless computing and containerization techniques for automatic
scalable big data application execution and reproducibility, and utilize the
adapter design pattern to enable application portability and reproducibility
across different clouds. Based on the approach, we propose and develop an
open-source toolkit that supports 1) on-demand distributed hardware and
software environment provisioning, 2) automatic data and configuration storage
for each execution, 3) flexible client modes based on user preferences, 4)
execution history query, and 5) simple reproducibility of existing executions
in the same environment or a different environment. We did extensive
experiments on both AWS and Azure using three big data analytics applications
that run on a virtual CPU/GPU cluster. Three main behaviors of our toolkit were
benchmarked: i) execution overhead ratio for reproducibility support, ii)
differences of reproducing the same application on AWS and Azure in terms of
execution time, budgetary cost and cost-performance ratio, iii) differences
between scale-out and scale-up approach for the same application on AWS and
Azure.</span>

                    <span>We study time-series classification (TSC), a fundamental task of time-series
data mining. Prior work has approached TSC from two major directions: (1)
similarity-based methods that classify time-series based on the nearest
neighbors, and (2) deep learning models that directly learn the representations
for classification in a data-driven manner. Motivated by the different working
mechanisms within these two research lines, we aim to connect them in such a
way as to jointly model time-series similarities and learn the representations.
This is a challenging task because it is unclear how we should efficiently
leverage similarity information. To tackle the challenge, we propose
Similarity-Aware Time-Series Classification (SimTSC), a conceptually simple and
general framework that models similarity information with graph neural networks
(GNNs). Specifically, we formulate TSC as a node classification problem in
graphs, where the nodes correspond to time-series, and the links correspond to
pair-wise similarities. We further design a graph construction strategy and a
batch training algorithm with negative sampling to improve training efficiency.
We instantiate SimTSC with ResNet as the backbone and Dynamic Time Warping
(DTW) as the similarity measure. Extensive experiments on the full UCR datasets
and several multivariate datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of
incorporating similarity information into deep learning models in both
supervised and semi-supervised settings. Our code is available at

                    <span>In the paper, we propose a class of faster adaptive Gradient Descent Ascent
(GDA) methods for solving the nonconvex-strongly-concave minimax problems based
on unified adaptive matrices, which include almost existing coordinate-wise and
global adaptive learning rates. Specifically, we propose a fast Adaptive
Gradient Decent Ascent (AdaGDA) method based on the basic momentum technique,
which reaches a lower gradient complexity of $O(\kappa^4\epsilon^{-4})$ for
finding an $\epsilon$-stationary point without large batches, which improves
the results of the existing adaptive GDA methods by a factor of
$O(\sqrt{\kappa})$. At the same time, we present an accelerated version of
AdaGDA (VR-AdaGDA) method based on the momentum-based variance reduced
technique, which achieves a lower gradient complexity of
$O(\kappa^{4.5}\epsilon^{-3})$ for finding an $\epsilon$-stationary point
without large batches, which improves the results of the existing adaptive GDA
methods by a factor of $O(\epsilon^{-1})$. Moreover, we prove that our
VR-AdaGDA method reaches the best known gradient complexity of
$O(\kappa^{3}\epsilon^{-3})$ with the mini-batch size $O(\kappa^3)$. In
particular, we provide an effective convergence analysis framework for our
adaptive GDA methods. Some experimental results on policy evaluation and fair
classifier tasks demonstrate the efficiency of our algorithms.</span>

                    <span>Adverse drug reactions / events (ADR/ADE) have a major impact on patient
health and health care costs. Detecting ADR&#x27;s as early as possible and sharing
them with regulators, pharma companies, and healthcare providers can prevent
morbidity and save many lives. While most ADR&#x27;s are not reported via formal
channels, they are often documented in a variety of unstructured conversations
such as social media posts by patients, customer support call transcripts, or
CRM notes of meetings between healthcare providers and pharma sales reps. In
this paper, we propose a natural language processing (NLP) solution that
detects ADR&#x27;s in such unstructured free-text conversations, which improves on
previous work in three ways. First, a new Named Entity Recognition (NER) model
obtains new state-of-the-art accuracy for ADR and Drug entity extraction on the
ADE, CADEC, and SMM4H benchmark datasets (91.75%, 78.76%, and 83.41% F1 scores
respectively). Second, two new Relation Extraction (RE) models are introduced -
one based on BioBERT while the other utilizing crafted features over a Fully
Connected Neural Network (FCNN) - are shown to perform on par with existing
state-of-the-art models, and outperform them when trained with a supplementary
clinician-annotated RE dataset. Third, a new text classification model, for
deciding if a conversation includes an ADR, obtains new state-of-the-art
accuracy on the CADEC dataset (86.69% F1 score). The complete solution is
implemented as a unified NLP pipeline in a production-grade library built on
top of Apache Spark, making it natively scalable and able to process millions
of batch or streaming records on commodity clusters.</span>

                    <span>Travel time is a crucial measure in transportation. Accurate travel time
prediction is also fundamental for operation and advanced information systems.
A variety of solutions exist for short-term travel time predictions such as
solutions that utilize real-time GPS data and optimization methods to track the
path of a vehicle. However, reliable long-term predictions remain challenging.
We show in this paper the applicability and usefulness of travel time i.e.
delivery time prediction for postal services. We investigate several methods
such as linear regression models and tree based ensembles such as random
forest, bagging, and boosting, that allow to predict delivery time by
conducting extensive experiments and considering many usability scenarios.
Results reveal that travel time prediction can help mitigate high delays in
postal services. We show that some boosting algorithms, such as light gradient
boosting and catboost, have a higher performance in terms of accuracy and
runtime efficiency than other baselines such as linear regression models,
bagging regressor and random forest.</span>

                    <span>The emergence of new nanoscale technologies has imposed significant
challenges to designing reliable electronic systems in radiation environments.
A few types of radiation like Total Ionizing Dose (TID) effects often cause
permanent damages on such nanoscale electronic devices, and current
state-of-the-art technologies to tackle TID make use of expensive
radiation-hardened devices. This paper focuses on a novel and different
approach: using machine learning algorithms on consumer electronic level Field
Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) to tackle TID effects and monitor them to
replace before they stop working. This condition has a research challenge to
anticipate when the board results in a total failure due to TID effects. We
observed internal measurements of the FPGA boards under gamma radiation and
used three different anomaly detection machine learning (ML) algorithms to
detect anomalies in the sensor measurements in a gamma-radiated environment.
The statistical results show a highly significant relationship between the
gamma radiation exposure levels and the board measurements. Moreover, our
anomaly detection results have shown that a One-Class Support Vector Machine
with Radial Basis Function Kernel has an average Recall score of 0.95. Also,
all anomalies can be detected before the boards stop working.</span>

                    <span>This paper presents local minimax regret lower bounds for adaptively
controlling linear-quadratic-Gaussian (LQG) systems. We consider smoothly
parametrized instances and provide an understanding of when logarithmic regret
is impossible which is both instance specific and flexible enough to take
problem structure into account. This understanding relies on two key notions:
That of local-uninformativeness; when the optimal policy does not provide
sufficient excitation for identification of the optimal policy, and yields a
degenerate Fisher information matrix; and that of
information-regret-boundedness, when the small eigenvalues of a
policy-dependent information matrix are boundable in terms of the regret of
that policy. Combined with a reduction to Bayesian estimation and application
of Van Trees&#x27; inequality, these two conditions are sufficient for proving
regret bounds on order of magnitude $\sqrt{T}$ in the time horizon, $T$. This
method yields lower bounds that exhibit tight dimensional dependencies and
scale naturally with control-theoretic problem constants. For instance, we are
able to prove that systems operating near marginal stability are fundamentally
hard to learn to control. We further show that large classes of systems satisfy
these conditions, among them any state-feedback system with both $A$- and
$B$-matrices unknown. Most importantly, we also establish that a nontrivial
class of partially observable systems, essentially those that are
over-actuated, satisfy these conditions, thus providing a $\sqrt{T}$ lower
bound also valid for partially observable systems. Finally, we turn to two
simple examples which demonstrate that our lower bound captures classical
control-theoretic intuition: our lower bounds diverge for systems operating
near marginal stability or with large filter gain -- these can be arbitrarily
hard to (learn to) control.</span>

the opportunities we have access to. Current audits for fairness are limited to
coarse-grained parity assessments at the level of sensitive groups. We propose
to audit for envy-freeness, a more granular criterion aligned with individual
preferences: every user should prefer their recommendations to those of other
users. Since auditing for envy requires to estimate the preferences of users
beyond their existing recommendations, we cast the audit as a new pure
exploration problem in multi-armed bandits. We propose a sample-efficient
algorithm with theoretical guarantees that it does not deteriorate user
experience. We also study the trade-offs achieved on real-world recommendation
datasets.</span>

                    <span>In bandits with distribution shifts, one aims to automatically detect an
unknown number $L$ of changes in reward distribution, and restart exploration
when necessary. While this problem remained open for many years, a recent
breakthrough of Auer et al. (2018, 2019) provide the first adaptive procedure
to guarantee an optimal (dynamic) regret $\sqrt{LT}$, for $T$ rounds, with no
knowledge of $L$. However, not all distributional shifts are equally severe,
e.g., suppose no best arm switches occur, then we cannot rule out that a regret
$O(\sqrt{T})$ may remain possible; in other words, is it possible to achieve
dynamic regret that optimally scales only with an unknown number of severe
shifts? This unfortunately has remained elusive, despite various attempts (Auer
et al., 2019, Foster et al., 2020).

We resolve this problem in the case of two-armed bandits: we derive an
adaptive procedure that guarantees a dynamic regret of order
$\tilde{O}(\sqrt{\tilde{L} T})$, where $\tilde L \ll L$ captures an unknown
number of severe best arm changes, i.e., with significant switches in rewards,
and which last sufficiently long to actually require a restart. As a
consequence, for any number $L$ of distributional shifts outside of these
severe shifts, our procedure achieves regret just $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{T})\ll
\tilde{O}(\sqrt{LT})$.

Finally, we note that our notion of severe shift applies in both classical
settings of stochastic switching bandits and of adversarial bandits.</span>

                    <span>Entropy coding is the backbone data compression. Novel machine-learning based
compression methods often use a new entropy coder called Asymmetric Numeral
Systems (ANS) [Duda et al., 2015], which provides very close to optimal
bitrates and simplifies [Townsend et al., 2019] advanced compression techniques
such as bits-back coding. However, researchers with a background in machine
learning often struggle to understand how ANS works, which prevents them from
exploiting its full versatility. This paper is meant as an educational resource
to make ANS more approachable by presenting it from a new perspective of latent
variable models and the so-called bits-back trick. We guide the reader step by
step to a complete implementation of ANS in the Python programming language,
which we then generalize for more advanced use cases. We also present and
empirically evaluate an open-source library of various entropy coders designed
for both research and production use. Related teaching videos and problem sets

                    <span>Self-supervision is recently surging at its new frontier of graph learning.
It facilitates graph representations beneficial to downstream tasks; but its
success could hinge on domain knowledge for handcraft or the often expensive
trials and errors. Even its state-of-the-art representative, graph contrastive
learning (GraphCL), is not completely free of those needs as GraphCL uses a
prefabricated prior reflected by the ad-hoc manual selection of graph data
augmentations. Our work aims at advancing GraphCL by answering the following
questions: How to represent the space of graph augmented views? What principle
can be relied upon to learn a prior in that space? And what framework can be
constructed to learn the prior in tandem with contrastive learning?
Accordingly, we have extended the prefabricated discrete prior in the
augmentation set, to a learnable continuous prior in the parameter space of
graph generators, assuming that graph priors per se, similar to the concept of
image manifolds, can be learned by data generation. Furthermore, to form
contrastive views without collapsing to trivial solutions due to the prior
learnability, we have leveraged both principles of information minimization
(InfoMin) and information bottleneck (InfoBN) to regularize the learned priors.
Eventually, contrastive learning, InfoMin, and InfoBN are incorporated
organically into one framework of bi-level optimization. Our principled and
automated approach has proven to be competitive against the state-of-the-art
graph self-supervision methods, including GraphCL, on benchmarks of small

                    <span>Communication is defined as the act of sharing or exchanging information,
ideas or feelings. To establish communication between two people, both of them
are required to have knowledge and understanding of a common language. But in
the case of deaf and dumb people, the means of communication are different.
Deaf is the inability to hear and dumb is the inability to speak. They
communicate using sign language among themselves and with normal people but
normal people do not take seriously the importance of sign language. Not
everyone possesses the knowledge and understanding of sign language which makes
communication difficult between a normal person and a deaf and dumb person. To
overcome this barrier, one can build a model based on machine learning. A model
can be trained to recognize different gestures of sign language and translate
them into English. This will help a lot of people in communicating and
conversing with deaf and dumb people. The existing Indian Sing Language
Recognition systems are designed using machine learning algorithms with single
and double-handed gestures but they are not real-time. In this paper, we
propose a method to create an Indian Sign Language dataset using a webcam and
then using transfer learning, train a TensorFlow model to create a real-time
Sign Language Recognition system. The system achieves a good level of accuracy
even with a limited size dataset.</span>

                    <span>Modern kernel-based two-sample tests have shown great success in
distinguishing complex, high-dimensional distributions with appropriate learned
kernels. Previous work has demonstrated that this kernel learning procedure
succeeds, assuming a considerable number of observed samples from each
distribution. In realistic scenarios with very limited numbers of data samples,
however, it can be challenging to identify a kernel powerful enough to
distinguish complex distributions. We address this issue by introducing the
problem of meta two-sample testing (M2ST), which aims to exploit (abundant)
auxiliary data on related tasks to find an algorithm that can quickly identify
a powerful test on new target tasks. We propose two specific algorithms for
this task: a generic scheme which improves over baselines and a more tailored
approach which performs even better. We provide both theoretical justification
and empirical evidence that our proposed meta-testing schemes out-perform
learning kernel-based tests directly from scarce observations, and identify
when such schemes will be successful.</span>

                    <span>Machine learning models often encounter distribution shifts when deployed in
the real world. In this paper, we focus on adaptation to label distribution
shift in the online setting, where the test-time label distribution is
continually changing and the model must dynamically adapt to it without
observing the true label. Leveraging a novel analysis, we show that the lack of
true label does not hinder estimation of the expected test loss, which enables
the reduction of online label shift adaptation to conventional online learning.
Informed by this observation, we propose adaptation algorithms inspired by
classical online learning techniques such as Follow The Leader (FTL) and Online
Gradient Descent (OGD) and derive their regret bounds. We empirically verify
our findings under both simulated and real world label distribution shifts and
show that OGD is particularly effective and robust to a variety of challenging
label shift scenarios.</span>

                    <span>Complex systems (stars, supernovae, galaxies, and clusters) often exhibit low
scatter relations between observable properties (e.g., luminosity, velocity
dispersion, oscillation period, temperature). These scaling relations can
illuminate the underlying physics and can provide observational tools for
estimating masses and distances. Machine learning can provide a systematic way
to search for new scaling relations (or for simple extensions to existing
relations) in abstract high-dimensional parameter spaces. We use a machine
learning tool called symbolic regression (SR), which models the patterns in a
given dataset in the form of analytic equations. We focus on the
Sunyaev-Zeldovich flux$-$cluster mass relation ($Y_\mathrm{SZ}-M$), the scatter
in which affects inference of cosmological parameters from cluster abundance
data. Using SR on the data from the IllustrisTNG hydrodynamical simulation, we
find a new proxy for cluster mass which combines $Y_\mathrm{SZ}$ and
concentration of ionized gas ($c_\mathrm{gas}$): $M \propto
Y_\mathrm{conc}^{3/5} \equiv Y_\mathrm{SZ}^{3/5} (1-A\, c_\mathrm{gas})$.
$Y_\mathrm{conc}$ reduces the scatter in the predicted $M$ by $\sim 20-30$% for
large clusters ($M\gtrsim 10^{14}\, h^{-1} \, M_\odot$) at both high and low
redshifts, as compared to using just $Y_\mathrm{SZ}$. We show that the
dependence on $c_\mathrm{gas}$ is linked to cores of clusters exhibiting larger
scatter than their outskirts. Finally, we test $Y_\mathrm{conc}$ on clusters
from simulations of the CAMELS project and show that $Y_\mathrm{conc}$ is
robust against variations in cosmology, astrophysics, subgrid physics, and
cosmic variance. Our results and methodology can be useful for accurate
multiwavelength cluster mass estimation from current and upcoming CMB and X-ray
surveys like ACT, SO, SPT, eROSITA and CMB-S4.</span>

                    <span>Although deep neural networks have achieved great performance on
classification tasks, recent studies showed that well trained networks can be
fooled by adding subtle noises. This paper introduces a new approach to improve
neural network robustness by applying the recovery process on top of the
naturally trained classifier. In this approach, images will be intentionally
corrupted by some significant operator and then be recovered before passing
through the classifiers. SARGAN -- an extension on Generative Adversarial
Networks (GAN) is capable of denoising radar signals. This paper will show that
SARGAN can also recover corrupted images by removing the adversarial effects.
Our results show that this approach does improve the performance of naturally

                    <span>Stochastic majorization-minimization (SMM) is an online extension of the
classical principle of majorization-minimization, which consists of sampling
i.i.d. data points from a fixed data distribution and minimizing a recursively
defined majorizing surrogate of an objective function. In this paper, we
introduce stochastic block majorization-minimization, where the surrogates can
now be only block multi-convex and a single block is optimized at a time within
a diminishing radius. Relaxing the standard strong convexity requirements for
surrogates in SMM, our framework gives wider applicability including online
CANDECOMP/PARAFAC (CP) dictionary learning and yields greater computational
efficiency especially when the problem dimension is large. We provide an
extensive convergence analysis on the proposed algorithm, which we derive under
possibly dependent data streams, relaxing the standard i.i.d. assumption on
data samples. We show that the proposed algorithm converges almost surely to
the set of stationary points of a nonconvex objective under constraints at a
rate $O((\log n)^{1+\eps}/n^{1/2})$ for the empirical loss function and
$O((\log n)^{1+\eps}/n^{1/4})$ for the expected loss function, where $n$
denotes the number of data samples processed. Under some additional assumption,
the latter convergence rate can be improved to $O((\log n)^{1+\eps}/n^{1/2})$.
Our results provide first convergence rate bounds for various online matrix and
tensor decomposition algorithms under a general Markovian data setting.</span>

                    <span>Self-attention shows outstanding competence in capturing long-range
relationships while enhancing performance on vision tasks, such as image
classification and image captioning. However, the self-attention module highly
relies on the dot product multiplication and dimension alignment among
query-key-value features, which cause two problems: (1) The dot product
multiplication results in exhaustive and redundant computation. (2) Due to the
visual feature map often appearing as a multi-dimensional tensor, reshaping the
scale of the tensor feature to adapt to the dimension alignment might destroy
the internal structure of the tensor feature map. To address these problems,
this paper proposes a self-attention plug-in module with its variants, namely,
Synthesizing Tensor Transformations (STT), for directly processing image tensor
features. Without computing the dot-product multiplication among
query-key-value, the basic STT is composed of the tensor transformation to
learn the synthetic attention weight from visual information. The effectiveness
of STT series is validated on the image classification and image caption.
Experiments show that the proposed STT achieves competitive performance while
keeping robustness compared to self-attention based above vision tasks.</span>

                    <span>Recent years have witnessed growing interests in online incremental learning.
However, there are three major challenges in this area. The first major
difficulty is concept drift, that is, the probability distribution in the
streaming data would change as the data arrives. The second major difficulty is
catastrophic forgetting, that is, forgetting what we have learned before when
learning new knowledge. The last one we often ignore is the learning of the
latent representation. Only good latent representation can improve the
prediction accuracy of the model. Our research builds on this observation and
attempts to overcome these difficulties. To this end, we propose an Adaptive
Online Incremental Learning for evolving data streams (AOIL). We use
auto-encoder with the memory module, on the one hand, we obtained the latent
features of the input, on the other hand, according to the reconstruction loss
of the auto-encoder with memory module, we could successfully detect the
existence of concept drift and trigger the update mechanism, adjust the model
parameters in time. In addition, we divide features, which are derived from the
activation of the hidden layers, into two parts, which are used to extract the
common and private features respectively. By means of this approach, the model
could learn the private features of the new coming instances, but do not forget
what we have learned in the past (shared features), which reduces the
occurrence of catastrophic forgetting. At the same time, to get the fusion
feature vector we use the self-attention mechanism to effectively fuse the
extracted features, which further improved the latent representation learning.</span>

                    <span>Federated Learning (FL) trains a machine learning model on distributed
clients without exposing individual data. Unlike centralized training that is
usually based on carefully-organized data, FL deals with on-device data that
are often unfiltered and imbalanced. As a result, conventional FL training
protocol that treats all data equally leads to a waste of local computational
resources and slows down the global learning process. To this end, we propose
FedBalancer, a systematic FL framework that actively selects clients&#x27; training
samples. Our sample selection strategy prioritizes more &quot;informative&quot; data
while respecting privacy and computational capabilities of clients. To better
utilize the sample selection to speed up global training, we further introduce
an adaptive deadline control scheme that predicts the optimal deadline for each
round with varying client train data. Compared with existing FL algorithms with
deadline configuration methods, our evaluation on five datasets from three
different domains shows that FedBalancer improves the time-to-accuracy
performance by 1.22~4.62x while improving the model accuracy by 1.0~3.3%. We
also show that FedBalancer is readily applicable to other FL approaches by
demonstrating that FedBalancer improves the convergence speed and accuracy when
operating jointly with three different FL algorithms.</span>

                    <span>Learning-based control of linear systems received a lot of attentions
recently. In popular settings, the true dynamical models are unknown to the
decision-maker and need to be interactively learned by applying control inputs
to the systems. Unlike the matured literature of efficient reinforcement
learning policies for adaptive control of a single system, results on joint
learning of multiple systems are not currently available. Especially, the
important problem of fast and reliable joint-stabilization remains unaddressed
and so is the focus of this work. We propose a novel joint learning-based
stabilization algorithm for quickly learning stabilizing policies for all
systems understudy, from the data of unstable state trajectories. The presented
procedure is shown to be notably effective such that it stabilizes the family

                    <span>This paper investigates the dynamics of competition among organizations with
unequal expertise. Multi-agent reinforcement learning has been used to simulate
and understand the impact of various incentive schemes designed to offset such
inequality. We design Touch-Mark, a game based on well-known
multi-agent-particle-environment, where two teams (weak, strong) with unequal
but changing skill levels compete against each other. For training such a game,
we propose a novel controller assisted multi-agent reinforcement learning
algorithm \our\, which empowers each agent with an ensemble of policies along
with a supervised controller that by selectively partitioning the sample space,
triggers intelligent role division among the teammates. Using C-MADDPG as an
underlying framework, we propose an incentive scheme for the weak team such
that the final rewards of both teams become the same. We find that in spite of
the incentive, the final reward of the weak team falls short of the strong
team. On inspecting, we realize that an overall incentive scheme for the weak
team does not incentivize the weaker agents within that team to learn and
improve. To offset this, we now specially incentivize the weaker player to
learn and as a result, observe that the weak team beyond an initial phase
performs at par with the stronger team. The final goal of the paper has been to
formulate a dynamic incentive scheme that continuously balances the reward of
the two teams. This is achieved by devising an incentive scheme enriched with
an RL agent which takes minimum information from the environment.</span>

                    <span>Traditional text classification approaches often require a good amount of
labeled data, which is difficult to obtain, especially in restricted domains or
less widespread languages. This lack of labeled data has led to the rise of
low-resource methods, that assume low data availability in natural language
processing. Among them, zero-shot learning stands out, which consists of
learning a classifier without any previously labeled data. The best results
reported with this approach use language models such as Transformers, but fall
into two problems: high execution time and inability to handle long texts as
input. This paper proposes a new model, ZeroBERTo, which leverages an
unsupervised clustering step to obtain a compressed data representation before
the classification task. We show that ZeroBERTo has better performance for long
inputs and shorter execution time, outperforming XLM-R by about 12% in the F1
score in the FolhaUOL dataset. Keywords: Low-Resource NLP, Unlabeled data,

                    <span>Control barrier functions (CBFs) have become a popular tool to enforce safety
of a control system. CBFs are commonly utilized in a quadratic program
formulation (CBF-QP) as safety-critical constraints. A class $\mathcal{K}$
function in CBFs usually needs to be tuned manually in order to balance the
trade-off between performance and safety for each environment. However, this
process is often heuristic and can become intractable for high relative-degree
systems. Moreover, it prevents the CBF-QP from generalizing to different
environments in the real world. By embedding the optimization procedure of the
CBF-QP as a differentiable layer within a deep learning architecture, we
propose a differentiable optimization-based safety-critical control framework
that enables generalization to new environments with forward invariance
guarantees. Finally, we validate the proposed control design with 2D double and
quadruple integrator systems in various environments.</span>

                    <span>The Cosmology and Astrophysics with MachinE Learning Simulations (CAMELS)
project was developed to combine cosmology with astrophysics through thousands
of cosmological hydrodynamic simulations and machine learning. CAMELS contains
4,233 cosmological simulations, 2,049 N-body and 2,184 state-of-the-art
hydrodynamic simulations that sample a vast volume in parameter space. In this
paper we present the CAMELS public data release, describing the characteristics
of the CAMELS simulations and a variety of data products generated from them,
including halo, subhalo, galaxy, and void catalogues, power spectra, bispectra,
Lyman-$\alpha$ spectra, probability distribution functions, halo radial
profiles, and X-rays photon lists. We also release over one thousand catalogues
that contain billions of galaxies from CAMELS-SAM: a large collection of N-body
simulations that have been combined with the Santa Cruz Semi-Analytic Model. We
release all the data, comprising more than 350 terabytes and containing 143,922
snapshots, millions of halos, galaxies and summary statistics. We provide

                    <span>Semantic communication, regarded as the breakthrough beyond Shannon paradigm,
aims at the successful transmission of semantic information conveyed by the
source rather than the accurate reception of each single symbol or bit
regardless of its meaning. This article provides an overview on semantic
communications. After a brief review on Shannon information theory, we discuss
semantic communications with theory, frameworks, and system design enabled by
deep learning. Different from the symbol/bit error rate used for measuring the
conventional communication systems, new performance metrics for semantic
communications are also discussed. The article is concluded by several open

                    <span>Graph neural networks can be effectively applied to find solutions for many
real-world problems across widely diverse fields. The success of graph neural
networks is linked to the message-passing mechanism on the graph, however, the
message-aggregating behavior is still not entirely clear in most algorithms. To
improve functionality, we propose a new transparent network called Graph
Decipher to investigate the message-passing mechanism by prioritizing in two
main components: the graph structure and node attributes, at the graph,
feature, and global levels on a graph under the node classification task.
However, the computation burden now becomes the most significant issue because
the relevance of both graph structure and node attributes are computed on a
graph. In order to solve this issue, only relevant representative node
attributes are extracted by graph feature filters, allowing calculations to be
performed in a category-oriented manner. Experiments on seven datasets show
that Graph Decipher achieves state-of-the-art performance while imposing a
substantially lower computation burden under the node classification task.
Additionally, since our algorithm has the ability to explore the representative
node attributes by category, it is utilized to alleviate the imbalanced node
classification problem on multi-class graph datasets.</span>

verify a true system&#x27;s capacity to satisfy its operational objective.
Specifically, whenever the system objective has a quantifiable measure of
satisfaction, i.e. a signal temporal logic specification, a barrier function,
etc - the authors develop two separate optimization problems solvable via a
Bayesian Optimization procedure detailed within. This dual approach has the
added benefit of quantifying the Sim2Real Gap between a system simulator and
its hardware counterpart. Our contributions are twofold. First, we show
repeatability with respect to our outlined optimization procedure in solving
these optimization problems. Second, we show that the same procedure can

                    <span>Federated learning (FL) is a widely adopted distributed learning paradigm in
practice, which intends to preserve users&#x27; data privacy while leveraging the
entire dataset of all participants for training. In FL, multiple models are
trained independently on the users and aggregated centrally to update a global
model in an iterative process. Although this approach is excellent at
preserving privacy by design, FL still tends to suffer from quality issues such
as attacks or byzantine faults. Some recent attempts have been made to address
such quality challenges on the robust aggregation techniques for FL. However,
the effectiveness of state-of-the-art (SOTA) robust FL techniques is still
unclear and lacks a comprehensive study. Therefore, to better understand the
current quality status and challenges of these SOTA FL techniques in the
presence of attacks and faults, in this paper, we perform a large-scale
empirical study to investigate the SOTA FL&#x27;s quality from multiple angles of
attacks, simulated faults (via mutation operators), and aggregation (defense)
methods. In particular, we perform our study on two generic image datasets and
one real-world federated medical image dataset. We also systematically
investigate the effect of the distribution of attacks/faults over users and the
independent and identically distributed (IID) factors, per dataset, on the
robustness results. After a large-scale analysis with 496 configurations, we
find that most mutators on each individual user have a negligible effect on the
final model. Moreover, choosing the most robust FL aggregator depends on the
attacks and datasets. Finally, we illustrate that it is possible to achieve a
generic solution that works almost as well or even better than any single
aggregator on all attacks and configurations with a simple ensemble model of
aggregators.</span>

                    <span>Deep learning methods can classify various unstructured data such as images,
language, and voice as input data. As the task of classifying anomalies becomes
more important in the real world, various methods exist for classifying using
deep learning with data collected in the real world. As the task of classifying
anomalies becomes more important in the real world, there are various methods
for classifying using deep learning with data collected in the real world.
Among the various methods, the representative approach is a method of
extracting and learning the main features based on a transition model from
pre-trained models, and a method of learning an autoencoderbased structure only
with normal data and classifying it as abnormal through a threshold value.
However, if the dataset is imbalanced, even the state-of-the-arts models do not
achieve good performance. This can be addressed by augmenting normal and
abnormal features in imbalanced data as features with strong distinction. We
use the features of the autoencoder to train latent vectors from low to high
dimensionality. We train normal and abnormal data as a feature that has a
strong distinction among the features of imbalanced data. We propose a latent
vector expansion autoencoder model that improves classification performance at
imbalanced data. The proposed method shows performance improvement compared to
the basic autoencoder using imbalanced anomaly dataset.</span>

channel state information (CSI) at the base station in order to determine
appropriate precoders. CSI acquisition requires sending pilot symbols which
induce an important overhead. In this paper, a method whose objective is to
determine an appropriate precoder from the knowledge of the user&#x27;s location
only is proposed. Such a way to determine precoders is known as location based
beamforming. It allows to reduce or even eliminate the need for pilot symbols,
depending on how the location is obtained. the proposed method learns a direct
mapping from location to precoder in a supervised way. It involves a neural
network with a specific structure based on random Fourier features allowing to
learn functions containing high spatial frequencies. It is assessed empirically
and yields promising results on realistic synthetic channels. As opposed to
previously proposed methods, it allows to handle both line-of-sight (LOS) and
non-line-of-sight (NLOS) channels.</span>

system. Due to their complexity, optimizers take experts months to write and
years to refine. In this work, we demonstrate for the first time that learning
to optimize queries without learning from an expert optimizer is both possible
and efficient. We present Balsa, a query optimizer built by deep reinforcement
learning. Balsa first learns basic knowledge from a simple,
environment-agnostic simulator, followed by safe learning in real execution. On
the Join Order Benchmark, Balsa matches the performance of two expert query
optimizers, both open-source and commercial, with two hours of learning, and
outperforms them by up to 2.8$\times$ in workload runtime after a few more
hours. Balsa thus opens the possibility of automatically learning to optimize
in future compute environments where expert-designed optimizers do not exist.</span>

                    <span>This paper introduces a new neural network-based estimation approach that is
inspired by the biological phenomenon whereby humans and animals vary the
levels of attention and effort that they dedicate to a problem depending upon
its difficulty. The proposed approach leverages alternate models&#x27; internal
levels of confidence in their own projections. If the least costly model is
confident in its classification, then that is the classification used; if not,
the model with the next lowest cost of implementation is run, and so on. This
use of successively more complex models -- together with the models&#x27; internal
propensity scores to evaluate their likelihood of being correct -- makes it
possible to substantially reduce resource use while maintaining high standards
for classification accuracy. The approach is applied to the digit recognition
problem from Google&#x27;s Street View House Numbers dataset, using Multilayer
Perceptron (MLP) neural networks trained on high- and low-resolution versions
of the digit images. The algorithm examines the low-resolution images first,
only moving to higher resolution images if the classification from the initial
low-resolution pass does not have a high degree of confidence. For the MLPs
considered here, this sequential approach enables a reduction in resource usage
of more than 50\% without any sacrifice in classification accuracy.</span>

dynamic oracle in the nonstationary bandit. We provide algorithms that attain

                    <span>Static graph neural networks have been widely used in modeling and
representation learning of graph structure data. However, many real-world
problems, such as social networks, financial transactions, recommendation
systems, etc., are dynamic, that is, nodes and edges are added or deleted over
time. Therefore, in recent years, dynamic graph neural networks have received
more and more attention from researchers. In this work, we propose a novel
dynamic graph neural network, Efficient-Dyn. It adaptively encodes temporal
information into a sequence of patches with an equal amount of
temporal-topological structure. Therefore, while avoiding the use of snapshots
to cause information loss, it also achieves a finer time granularity, which is
close to what continuous networks could provide. In addition, we also designed
a lightweight module, Sparse Temporal Transformer, to compute node
representations through both structural neighborhoods and temporal dynamics.
Since the fully-connected attention conjunction is simplified, the computation
cost is far lower than the current state-of-the-arts. Link prediction
experiments are conducted on both continuous and discrete graph datasets.
Through comparing with several state-of-the-art graph embedding baselines, the
experimental results demonstrate that Efficient-Dyn has a faster inference
speed while having competitive performance.</span>

applications involving computer vision and natural language processing. The
type of pretext task is important to this boost in performance. One common
pretext task is the measure of similarity and dissimilarity between pairs of
images. In this scenario, the two images that make up the negative pair are
visibly different to humans. However, in entomology, species are nearly
indistinguishable and thus hard to differentiate. In this study, we explored
the performance of a Siamese neural network using contrastive loss by learning
to push apart embeddings of bumblebee species pair that are dissimilar, and
pull together similar embeddings. Our experimental results show a 61% F1-score
on zero-shot instances, a performance showing 11% improvement on samples of
classes that share intersections with the training set.</span>

                    <span>In bandits with distribution shifts, one aims to automatically detect an
unknown number $L$ of changes in reward distribution, and restart exploration
when necessary. While this problem remained open for many years, a recent
breakthrough of Auer et al. (2018, 2019) provide the first adaptive procedure
to guarantee an optimal (dynamic) regret $\sqrt{LT}$, for $T$ rounds, with no
knowledge of $L$. However, not all distributional shifts are equally severe,
e.g., suppose no best arm switches occur, then we cannot rule out that a regret
$O(\sqrt{T})$ may remain possible; in other words, is it possible to achieve
dynamic regret that optimally scales only with an unknown number of severe
shifts? This unfortunately has remained elusive, despite various attempts (Auer
et al., 2019, Foster et al., 2020).

We resolve this problem in the case of two-armed bandits: we derive an
adaptive procedure that guarantees a dynamic regret of order
$\tilde{O}(\sqrt{\tilde{L} T})$, where $\tilde L \ll L$ captures an unknown
number of severe best arm changes, i.e., with significant switches in rewards,
and which last sufficiently long to actually require a restart. As a
consequence, for any number $L$ of distributional shifts outside of these
severe shifts, our procedure achieves regret just $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{T})\ll
\tilde{O}(\sqrt{LT})$.

Finally, we note that our notion of severe shift applies in both classical
settings of stochastic switching bandits and of adversarial bandits.</span>

with the Arcade Learning Environment (ALE), the shift towards
computationally-demanding benchmarks has led to the practice of evaluating only
a small number of runs per task, exacerbating the statistical uncertainty in
point estimates. In this paper, we argue that reliable evaluation in the few
run deep RL regime cannot ignore the uncertainty in results without running the
risk of slowing down progress in the field. We illustrate this point using a
case study on the Atari 100k benchmark, where we find substantial discrepancies
between conclusions drawn from point estimates alone versus a more thorough
statistical analysis. With the aim of increasing the field&#x27;s confidence in
reported results with a handful of runs, we advocate for reporting interval
estimates of aggregate performance and propose performance profiles to account
for the variability in results, as well as present more robust and efficient
aggregate metrics, such as interquartile mean scores, to achieve small
uncertainty in results. Using such statistical tools, we scrutinize performance
evaluations of existing algorithms on other widely used RL benchmarks including
the ALE, Procgen, and the DeepMind Control Suite, again revealing discrepancies
in prior comparisons. Our findings call for a change in how we evaluate
performance in deep RL, for which we present a more rigorous evaluation
methodology, accompanied with an open-source library rliable, to prevent
unreliable results from stagnating the field.</span>

                    <span>We perform a systematic analysis of the quality of fit of the stochastic
block model (SBM) for 275 empirical networks spanning a wide range of domains
and orders of size magnitude. We employ posterior predictive model checking as
a criterion to assess the quality of fit, which involves comparing networks
generated by the inferred model with the empirical network, according to a set
of network descriptors. We observe that the SBM is capable of providing an
accurate description for the majority of networks considered, but falls short
of saturating all modeling requirements. In particular, networks possessing a
large diameter and slow-mixing random walks tend to be badly described by the
SBM. However, contrary to what is often assumed, networks with a high abundance
of triangles can be well described by the SBM in many cases. We demonstrate
that simple network descriptors can be used to evaluate whether or not the SBM
can provide a sufficiently accurate representation, potentially pointing to
possible model extensions that can systematically improve the expressiveness of
this class of models.</span>

                    <span>In binary classification, imbalance refers to situations in which one class
is heavily under-represented. This issue is due to either a data collection
process or because one class is indeed rare in a population. Imbalanced
classification frequently arises in applications such as biology, medicine,
engineering, and social sciences. In this paper, for the first time, we
theoretically study the impact of imbalance class sizes on the linear
discriminant analysis (LDA) in high dimensions. We show that due to data
scarcity in one class, referred to as the minority class, and
high-dimensionality of the feature space, the LDA ignores the minority class
yielding a maximum misclassification rate. We then propose a new construction
of hard-thresholding rules based on a data splitting technique that reduces the
large difference between the misclassification rates. We show that the proposed
method is asymptotically optimal. We further study two well-known sparse
versions of the LDA in imbalanced cases. We evaluate the finite-sample
performance of different methods using simulations and by analyzing two real
data sets. The results show that our method either outperforms its competitors
or has comparable performance based on a much smaller subset of selected
features, while being computationally more efficient.</span>

                    <span>The machine learning (ML) life cycle involves a series of iterative steps,
from the effective gathering and preparation of the data, including complex
feature engineering processes, to the presentation and improvement of results,
with various algorithms to choose from in every step. Feature engineering in
particular can be very beneficial for ML, leading to numerous improvements such
as boosting the predictive results, decreasing computational times, reducing
excessive noise, and increasing the transparency behind the decisions taken
during the training. Despite that, while several visual analytics tools exist
to monitor and control the different stages of the ML life cycle (especially
those related to data and algorithms), feature engineering support remains
inadequate. In this paper, we present FeatureEnVi, a visual analytics system
specifically designed to assist with the feature engineering process. Our
proposed system helps users to choose the most important feature, to transform
the original features into powerful alternatives, and to experiment with
different feature generation combinations. Additionally, data space slicing
allows users to explore the impact of features on both local and global scales.
FeatureEnVi utilizes multiple automatic feature selection techniques;
furthermore, it visually guides users with statistical evidence about the
influence of each feature (or subsets of features). The final outcome is the
extraction of heavily engineered features, evaluated by multiple validation
metrics. The usefulness and applicability of FeatureEnVi are demonstrated with
two use cases and a case study. We also report feedback from interviews with
two ML experts and a visualization researcher who assessed the effectiveness of
our system.</span>

                    <span>Modern kernel-based two-sample tests have shown great success in
distinguishing complex, high-dimensional distributions with appropriate learned
kernels. Previous work has demonstrated that this kernel learning procedure
succeeds, assuming a considerable number of observed samples from each
distribution. In realistic scenarios with very limited numbers of data samples,
however, it can be challenging to identify a kernel powerful enough to
distinguish complex distributions. We address this issue by introducing the
problem of meta two-sample testing (M2ST), which aims to exploit (abundant)
auxiliary data on related tasks to find an algorithm that can quickly identify
a powerful test on new target tasks. We propose two specific algorithms for
this task: a generic scheme which improves over baselines and a more tailored
approach which performs even better. We provide both theoretical justification
and empirical evidence that our proposed meta-testing schemes out-perform
learning kernel-based tests directly from scarce observations, and identify
when such schemes will be successful.</span>

                    <span>Machine learning models often encounter distribution shifts when deployed in
the real world. In this paper, we focus on adaptation to label distribution
shift in the online setting, where the test-time label distribution is
continually changing and the model must dynamically adapt to it without
observing the true label. Leveraging a novel analysis, we show that the lack of
true label does not hinder estimation of the expected test loss, which enables
the reduction of online label shift adaptation to conventional online learning.
Informed by this observation, we propose adaptation algorithms inspired by
classical online learning techniques such as Follow The Leader (FTL) and Online
Gradient Descent (OGD) and derive their regret bounds. We empirically verify
our findings under both simulated and real world label distribution shifts and
show that OGD is particularly effective and robust to a variety of challenging
label shift scenarios.</span>

                    <span>Feature selection, as a vital dimension reduction technique, reduces data
dimension by identifying an essential subset of input features, which can
facilitate interpretable insights into learning and inference processes.
Algorithmic stability is a key characteristic of an algorithm regarding its
sensitivity to perturbations of input samples. In this paper, we propose an
innovative unsupervised feature selection algorithm attaining this stability
with provable guarantees. The architecture of our algorithm consists of a
feature scorer and a feature selector. The scorer trains a neural network (NN)
to globally score all the features, and the selector adopts a dependent sub-NN
to locally evaluate the representation abilities for selecting features.
Further, we present algorithmic stability analysis and show that our algorithm
has a performance guarantee via a generalization error bound. Extensive
experimental results on real-world datasets demonstrate superior generalization
performance of our proposed algorithm to strong baseline methods. Also, the
properties revealed by our theoretical analysis and the stability of our
algorithm-selected features are empirically confirmed.</span>

to audit for envy-freeness, a more granular criterion aligned with individual

beyond their existing recommendations, we cast the audit as a new pure

mainly on synthetic datasets and use a limited number of applications. OARF
mimics more realistic application scenarios with publicly available data sets
as different data silos in image, text and structured data. Our

                    <span>Generative adversarial networks (GANs) with clustered latent spaces can
perform conditional generation in a completely unsupervised manner. In the real
world, the salient attributes of unlabeled data can be imbalanced. However,
most of existing unsupervised conditional GANs cannot cluster attributes of
these data in their latent spaces properly because they assume uniform
distributions of the attributes. To address this problem, we theoretically
derive Stein latent optimization that provides reparameterizable gradient
estimations of the latent distribution parameters assuming a Gaussian mixture
prior in a continuous latent space. Structurally, we introduce an encoder
network and novel unsupervised conditional contrastive loss to ensure that data
generated from a single mixture component represent a single attribute. We
confirm that the proposed method, named Stein Latent Optimization for GANs
(SLOGAN), successfully learns balanced or imbalanced attributes and achieves
state-of-the-art unsupervised conditional generation performance even in the
absence of attribute information (e.g., the imbalance ratio). Moreover, we
demonstrate that the attributes to be learned can be manipulated using a small
amount of probe data.</span>

                    <span>We consider a matrix completion problem that exploits social or item
similarity graphs as side information. We develop a universal, parameter-free,
and computationally efficient algorithm that starts with hierarchical graph
clustering and then iteratively refines estimates both on graph clustering and
matrix ratings. Under a hierarchical stochastic block model that well respects
practically-relevant social graphs and a low-rank rating matrix model (to be
detailed), we demonstrate that our algorithm achieves the information-theoretic
limit on the number of observed matrix entries (i.e., optimal sample
complexity) that is derived by maximum likelihood estimation together with a
lower-bound impossibility result. One consequence of this result is that
exploiting the hierarchical structure of social graphs yields a substantial
gain in sample complexity relative to the one that simply identifies different
groups without resorting to the relational structure across them. We conduct
extensive experiments both on synthetic and real-world datasets to corroborate
our theoretical results as well as to demonstrate significant performance
improvements over other matrix completion algorithms that leverage graph side

                    <span>A common approach to solving tasks, such as node classification or link
prediction, on a large network begins by learning a Euclidean embedding of the
nodes of the network, from which regular machine learning methods can be
applied. For unsupervised random walk methods such as DeepWalk and node2vec,
adding a $\ell_2$ penalty on the embedding vectors to the loss leads to
improved downstream task performance. In this paper we study the effects of
this regularization and prove that, under exchangeability assumptions on the
graph, it asymptotically leads to learning a nuclear-norm-type penalized
graphon. In particular, the exact form of the penalty depends on the choice of
subsampling method used within stochastic gradient descent to learn the
embeddings. We also illustrate empirically that concatenating node covariates
to $\ell_2$ regularized node2vec embeddings leads to comparable, if not
superior, performance to methods which incorporate node covariates and the
network structure in a non-linear manner.</span>

                    <span>The covariance structure of multivariate functional data can be highly
complex, especially if the multivariate dimension is large, making extensions
of statistical methods for standard multivariate data to the functional data
setting challenging. For example, Gaussian graphical models have recently been
extended to the setting of multivariate functional data by applying
multivariate methods to the coefficients of truncated basis expansions.
However, a key difficulty compared to multivariate data is that the covariance
operator is compact, and thus not invertible. The methodology in this paper
addresses the general problem of covariance modeling for multivariate
functional data, and functional Gaussian graphical models in particular. As a
first step, a new notion of separability for the covariance operator of
multivariate functional data is proposed, termed partial separability, leading
to a novel Karhunen-Lo\&#x60;eve-type expansion for such data. Next, the partial
separability structure is shown to be particularly useful in order to provide a
well-defined functional Gaussian graphical model that can be identified with a
sequence of finite-dimensional graphical models, each of identical fixed
dimension. This motivates a simple and efficient estimation procedure through
application of the joint graphical lasso. Empirical performance of the method
for graphical model estimation is assessed through simulation and analysis of
functional brain connectivity during a motor task. %Empirical performance of

commonly employed to handle time-varying reward distributions: adversarial
bandit and nonstationary bandit. Although their oracles, algorithms, and regret
analysis differ significantly, we provide a unified formulation in this paper
that smoothly bridges the two as special cases. The formulation uses an oracle
that takes the best-fixed arm within time windows. Depending on the window

                    <span>Travel time is a crucial measure in transportation. Accurate travel time
prediction is also fundamental for operation and advanced information systems.
A variety of solutions exist for short-term travel time predictions such as
solutions that utilize real-time GPS data and optimization methods to track the
path of a vehicle. However, reliable long-term predictions remain challenging.
We show in this paper the applicability and usefulness of travel time i.e.
delivery time prediction for postal services. We investigate several methods
such as linear regression models and tree based ensembles such as random
forest, bagging, and boosting, that allow to predict delivery time by
conducting extensive experiments and considering many usability scenarios.
Results reveal that travel time prediction can help mitigate high delays in
postal services. We show that some boosting algorithms, such as light gradient
boosting and catboost, have a higher performance in terms of accuracy and
runtime efficiency than other baselines such as linear regression models,
bagging regressor and random forest.</span>

                    <span>Neural networks are known to be vulnerable to adversarial attacks -- slight
but carefully constructed perturbations of the inputs which can drastically
impair the network&#x27;s performance. Many defense methods have been proposed for
improving robustness of deep networks by training them on adversarially
perturbed inputs. However, these models often remain vulnerable to new types of
attacks not seen during training, and even to slightly stronger versions of
previously seen attacks. In this work, we propose a novel approach to
adversarial robustness, which builds upon the insights from the domain
adaptation field. Our method, called Adversarial Feature Desensitization (AFD),
aims at learning features that are invariant towards adversarial perturbations
of the inputs. This is achieved through a game where we learn features that are
both predictive and robust (insensitive to adversarial attacks), i.e. cannot be
used to discriminate between natural and adversarial data. Empirical results on
several benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach
against a wide range of attack types and attack strengths. Our code is
available at https://github.com/BashivanLab/afd.</span>

                    <span>This paper presents local minimax regret lower bounds for adaptively
controlling linear-quadratic-Gaussian (LQG) systems. We consider smoothly
parametrized instances and provide an understanding of when logarithmic regret
is impossible which is both instance specific and flexible enough to take
problem structure into account. This understanding relies on two key notions:
That of local-uninformativeness; when the optimal policy does not provide
sufficient excitation for identification of the optimal policy, and yields a
degenerate Fisher information matrix; and that of
information-regret-boundedness, when the small eigenvalues of a
policy-dependent information matrix are boundable in terms of the regret of
that policy. Combined with a reduction to Bayesian estimation and application
of Van Trees&#x27; inequality, these two conditions are sufficient for proving
regret bounds on order of magnitude $\sqrt{T}$ in the time horizon, $T$. This
method yields lower bounds that exhibit tight dimensional dependencies and
scale naturally with control-theoretic problem constants. For instance, we are
able to prove that systems operating near marginal stability are fundamentally
hard to learn to control. We further show that large classes of systems satisfy
these conditions, among them any state-feedback system with both $A$- and
$B$-matrices unknown. Most importantly, we also establish that a nontrivial
class of partially observable systems, essentially those that are
over-actuated, satisfy these conditions, thus providing a $\sqrt{T}$ lower
bound also valid for partially observable systems. Finally, we turn to two
simple examples which demonstrate that our lower bound captures classical
control-theoretic intuition: our lower bounds diverge for systems operating
near marginal stability or with large filter gain -- these can be arbitrarily
hard to (learn to) control.</span>

                    <span>Entropy coding is the backbone data compression. Novel machine-learning based
compression methods often use a new entropy coder called Asymmetric Numeral
Systems (ANS) [Duda et al., 2015], which provides very close to optimal
bitrates and simplifies [Townsend et al., 2019] advanced compression techniques
such as bits-back coding. However, researchers with a background in machine
learning often struggle to understand how ANS works, which prevents them from
exploiting its full versatility. This paper is meant as an educational resource
to make ANS more approachable by presenting it from a new perspective of latent
variable models and the so-called bits-back trick. We guide the reader step by
step to a complete implementation of ANS in the Python programming language,
which we then generalize for more advanced use cases. We also present and
empirically evaluate an open-source library of various entropy coders designed
for both research and production use. Related teaching videos and problem sets
are available online.</span>

                    <span>Recent advances in counter-adversarial systems have garnered significant
research interest in inverse filtering from a Bayesian perspective. For
example, interest in estimating the adversary&#x27;s Kalman filter tracked estimate
with the purpose of predicting the adversary&#x27;s future steps has led to recent
formulations of inverse Kalman filter (I-KF). In this context of inverse
filtering, we address the key challenges of nonlinear process dynamics and
unknown input to the forward filter by proposing inverse extended Kalman filter
(I-EKF). We derive I-EKF with and without an unknown input by considering
nonlinearity in both forward and inverse state-space models. In the process,
I-KF-with-unknown-input is also obtained. We then provide theoretical stability
guarantees using both bounded nonlinearity and unknown matrix approaches. We
further generalize these formulations and results to the case of higher-order,
Gaussian-sum, and dithered I-EKFs. Numerical experiments validate our methods
for various proposed inverse filters using the recursive Cram\&#x27;er-Rao lower
bound as a benchmark.</span>

                    <span>Stochastic majorization-minimization (SMM) is an online extension of the
classical principle of majorization-minimization, which consists of sampling
i.i.d. data points from a fixed data distribution and minimizing a recursively
defined majorizing surrogate of an objective function. In this paper, we
introduce stochastic block majorization-minimization, where the surrogates can
now be only block multi-convex and a single block is optimized at a time within
a diminishing radius. Relaxing the standard strong convexity requirements for
surrogates in SMM, our framework gives wider applicability including online
CANDECOMP/PARAFAC (CP) dictionary learning and yields greater computational
efficiency especially when the problem dimension is large. We provide an
extensive convergence analysis on the proposed algorithm, which we derive under
possibly dependent data streams, relaxing the standard i.i.d. assumption on
data samples. We show that the proposed algorithm converges almost surely to
the set of stationary points of a nonconvex objective under constraints at a
rate $O((\log n)^{1+\eps}/n^{1/2})$ for the empirical loss function and
$O((\log n)^{1+\eps}/n^{1/4})$ for the expected loss function, where $n$
denotes the number of data samples processed. Under some additional assumption,
the latter convergence rate can be improved to $O((\log n)^{1+\eps}/n^{1/2})$.
Our results provide first convergence rate bounds for various online matrix and
tensor decomposition algorithms under a general Markovian data setting.</span>

                    <span>The goal of NAS is to find an optimal architecture of a neural network for a given problem. In my case, I am interested in creating an algorithm for finding the architecture of a Convolutional Neural Network for an Image dataset.
 The problem with any NAS algorithm is that the only true way to know if a created architecture is good is by running the model to convergence, thus increasing computational resources spent.
 There have been many possible solutions to gauge the relative trained accuracy of model. The most popular is to simply reduce the dataset, reuse training weights, and/or train for only a couple of iterations.
 I was wanting to hear some thoughts...
 I can save computational resources by only training each possible model for only 3 iterations and gauge its success using its training accuracy. The problem however with using training accuracy is that it does not gauge how well the model will generalize, only if it is capable of learning anything from the training data, if not overfitting. The problem with using the validation accuracy after 3 iterations is that most models have extremely poor validation accuracy scores early on during training, only catching up around iteration 10, therefore in order to fully gauged the validation accuracy the models would have to be trained until iteration 10, 3x more than using the training accuracy after 3 iterations.
 Would you rather train the models for only 3 iterations, using training accuracy as the metric to compare models, risking the models overfitting when trained until convergence; or, would you rather play the safe game and train models for 10 iterations using validation accuracy as a metric to compare models, but spend 3x the amount of computational resources?

                    <span>There has been a lot of recent work on model calibration — ensuring a match between a model’s confidence and correctness.
 This seems critical in applications where confidence/safety matters (e.g. perception related parts of self-driving), but I’m curious whether model calibration is something important for industry practitioners.

 Based on some feedback I implemented a few extra features, and today I launched a Discord community to go along with it - this allows people to find teammates to collaborate with on a competition, and to get real-time alerts when new competitions are launched. There are also a few team members from the competition platforms in the Discord already.

 Also welcome is discussion about ongoing competitions, and post-mortems/debriefs after competitions end. If this sounds interesting to you, you can join the Discord here: https://discord.com/invite/nM482gc9h8
 Hope to see you there!

                    <span>In the domain of uncertainty estimation in places like segmentation, MC Dropout is used as an approximation of Bayesian computations. I&#x27;ve seen a thread from a few years ago talking about its issues and I&#x27;ve just read this recent paper called Is MC Dropout Bayesian?, and they conclude it isn&#x27;t.
 They propose a new method for parametric VI based on the reparametrization trick and stochastic backpropagation, but my maths isn&#x27;t good enough to fully understand it. 
 Does anyone have any thoughts on this? I find it a little strange that every uncertainty estimation paper in segmentation just uses MC Dropout as a default, with just a throwaway line that it is &quot;approximately Bayesian&quot;, even though it isn&#x27;t!

 In a previous article, we discussed OneFlow’s techniques for optimizing the Softmax CUDA Kernel. The performance of the OneFlow-optimized Softmax greatly exceeds that of the Softmax of CuDNN, and OneFlow also fully optimizes half types that many frameworks do not take into account.
 Here, we share OneFlow’s approach for optimizing the performance of another important operator, LayerNorm.

 I recently came across neuro-symbolic ai, and the concept looked really cool. However, except for a 2-3 papers from IBM-MIT research and a couple of blogs, I couldn’t find any work in this direction. 
  
Apart from VQA, what kind of potential domains can NS be applied to?
 Are there any caveats I am not aware of as to why not many from the community are not working in this direction?
  
Thank you!

                    <span>Hello, I have an issue with the training of a GAN, which consists of a generator and two discriminators, each discriminator working on one specific domain (i.e. time domain and time-frequency domain).
 The generator is used to generate waveforms, provided other waveforms (i.e. noisy waveform to de-noised waveform).
 ​
 The whole GAN is trained in the following way:
 1-The generator is independently pre-trained by regression, until validation losses reach a plateau.
 2-The two randomly initialized discriminators are then activated, and GANs training takes place.
 ​
 The output of step 1. is a raw version of the desired output.
 However, step 2 inititially degrades the output of the generator, by removing too much information. This is also reflected in all the validation losses, whose values…</span>

 Anyone take Datacamp courses and do projects?
 So quite a lot of projects and courses actually apply data preprocessing techniques before splitting data that encourage data leakage. 
 I can&#x27;t believe I paid for their services......
 Anyone catch other bad habits that Datacamp encourages? Aside from being a rather ineffective platform to learn?

                    <span>Hi!
 I am currently involved in a project that needs me to classify multimodal data - In which one modality is image. I went through many papers on the topic and most of them just seem to choose a random pretrained architecture for the same - VGG19 being the most common. I found little to no reason for the same except for the performance being better than other models.
 So basically, I want to know whether there is a way to choose the right model? And if not, which one out of Inception, VGG and ResNet are the best for binary image classification on a large scale? 
 Thanks!

                    <span>Hello, Currently I am learning NN algos, because I want to create a project, but during this time I got an idea for another project, I&#x27;m curious if its possible. Some of us have their favourite games of all times as do I, i.e. skyrim. And I got the second idea for the project. What if I created some kind of a &quot;chat bot&quot; that runs in the background in real time. It would allow player, to communicate with npcs with their own voice and ask them something that is not scripted in the game itself, but is &quot;lore friendly&quot;, by this I mean no questions about trump, biden or tiktok lol. Of course the second step would be to synthesize the voices of npcs for their generated dialogue. What I&#x27;d like to know is if that is possible, not only from proggramimg perspecitve(cuz anything given enough time would be completed), but is it possible for modern computers to run?
 It is just a crazy idea of a begginer lol

 I am trying to look at the code from a paper (https://github.com/anirudh9119/shared_workspace/tree/main/Triangle). I can code fluently and I know RL quite well in theory, the problem is I don&#x27;t have much hands-on experience yet. Perhaps this is why I get confused when looking at this repo, not because I don&#x27;t understand how the algorithm works, but because I can&#x27;t find the code for it. Specifically, I would like to take the code for this algorithm: 
 https://preview.redd.it/vip5wrq3p9a81.png?width&#x3D;957&amp;format&#x3D;png&amp;auto&#x3D;webp&amp;s&#x3D;4735929cbbd651d1d26dcbdfcb33b2a99be28c16
 Naively, I would expect to see one file with all the classes and functions needed for this agent, and then another file with the agent imported and the reinforcement learning task performed in a certain environment. Instead, in this repo there are so many files with so many classes and so many functions, that I get lost and I can&#x27;t identify which code refers to this algorithm. I can&#x27;t see where the agent is, I can&#x27;t see where the task is performed and so on. 
 I don&#x27;t understand if the repo is actually messy, or if it&#x27;s just due to the fact that I&#x27;m not interpreting it in the right way. 
 Thanks!

                    <span>Hi everyone!
 I&#x27;m mostly interested in Offline RL approaches for environments with distribution shift. I&#x27;m reading Decision Transformer: Reinforcement Learning via Sequence Modeling (https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.01345) paper, and was wondering what would be the benchmark / SOTA right now?

 I am currently using a PPO implementation (using pytorch) that has the actor and critic networks defined under one class (Class ActorCritic(nn.Module)), where each network is defined using nn.sequential (self.actor &#x3D; nn.sequential ... and self.critic&#x3D;nn.sequential).
 Is there a way to define both networks in the same class but using the forward method instead of nn.sequential?

                    <span>The neural network-based approach to solving partial differential equations
has attracted considerable attention due to its simplicity and flexibility in
representing the solution of the partial differential equation. In training a
neural network, the network learns global features corresponding to
low-frequency components while high-frequency components are approximated at a
much slower rate. For a class of equations in which the solution contains a
wide range of scales, the network training process can suffer from slow
convergence and low accuracy due to its inability to capture the high-frequency
components. In this work, we propose a hierarchical approach to improve the
convergence rate and accuracy of the neural network solution to partial
differential equations. The proposed method comprises multi-training levels in
which a newly introduced neural network is guided to learn the residual of the
previous level approximation. By the nature of neural networks&#x27; training
process, the high-level correction is inclined to capture the high-frequency
components. We validate the efficiency and robustness of the proposed
hierarchical approach through a suite of linear and nonlinear partial
differential equations.</span>

                    <span>In computer vision and natural language processing, innovations in model
architecture that increase model capacity have reliably translated into gains
in performance. In stark contrast with this trend, state-of-the-art
reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms often use small MLPs, and gains in
performance typically originate from algorithmic innovations. It is natural to
hypothesize that small datasets in RL necessitate simple models to avoid
overfitting; however, this hypothesis is untested. In this paper we investigate
how RL agents are affected by exchanging the small MLPs with larger modern
networks with skip connections and normalization, focusing specifically on
actor-critic algorithms. We empirically verify that naively adopting such
architectures leads to instabilities and poor performance, likely contributing
to the popularity of simple models in practice. However, we show that dataset
size is not the limiting factor, and instead argue that instability from taking
gradients through the critic is the culprit. We demonstrate that spectral
normalization (SN) can mitigate this issue and enable stable training with
large modern architectures. After smoothing with SN, larger models yield
significant performance improvements -- suggesting that more &quot;easy&quot; gains may
be had by focusing on model architectures in addition to algorithmic
innovations.</span>

                    <span>Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) is one promising approach to teaching
robots to perform complex tasks. Because methods that directly reuse the stored
experience data cannot follow the change of the environment in robotic problems
with a time-varying environment, online DRL is required. The eligibility traces
method is well known as an online learning technique for improving sample
efficiency in traditional reinforcement learning with linear regressors rather
than DRL. The dependency between parameters of deep neural networks would
destroy the eligibility traces, which is why they are not integrated with DRL.
Although replacing the gradient with the most influential one rather than
accumulating the gradients as the eligibility traces can alleviate this
problem, the replacing operation reduces the number of reuses of previous
experiences. To address these issues, this study proposes a new eligibility
traces method that can be used even in DRL while maintaining high sample
efficiency. When the accumulated gradients differ from those computed using the
latest parameters, the proposed method takes into account the divergence
between the past and latest parameters to adaptively decay the eligibility
traces. Bregman divergences between outputs computed by the past and latest
parameters are exploited due to the infeasible computational cost of the
divergence between the past and latest parameters. In addition, a generalized
method with multiple time-scale traces is designed for the first time. This
design allows for the replacement of the most influential adaptively
accumulated (decayed) eligibility traces.</span>

                    <span>Dynamic objects have a significant impact on the robot&#x27;s perception of the
environment which degrades the performance of essential tasks such as
localization and mapping. In this work, we address this problem by synthesizing
plausible color, texture and geometry in regions occluded by dynamic objects.
We propose the novel geometry-aware DynaFill architecture that follows a
coarse-to-fine topology and incorporates our gated recurrent feedback mechanism
to adaptively fuse information from previous timesteps. We optimize our
architecture using adversarial training to synthesize fine realistic textures
which enables it to hallucinate color and depth structure in occluded regions
online in a spatially and temporally coherent manner, without relying on future
frame information. Casting our inpainting problem as an image-to-image
translation task, our model also corrects regions correlated with the presence
of dynamic objects in the scene, such as shadows or reflections. We introduce a
large-scale hyperrealistic dataset with RGB-D images, semantic segmentation
labels, camera poses as well as groundtruth RGB-D information of occluded
regions. Extensive quantitative and qualitative evaluations show that our
approach achieves state-of-the-art performance, even in challenging weather
conditions. Furthermore, we present results for retrieval-based visual
localization with the synthesized images that demonstrate the utility of our
approach.</span>

                    <span>Over the past several years, legal applications of deep learning have been on
the rise. However, as with other high-stakes decision making areas, the
requirement for interpretability is of crucial importance. Current models
utilized by legal practitioners are more of the conventional machine learning
type, wherein they are inherently interpretable, yet unable to harness the
performance capabilities of data-driven deep learning models. In this work, we
utilize deep learning models in the area of trademark law to shed light on the
issue of likelihood of confusion between trademarks. Specifically, we introduce
a model-agnostic interpretable intermediate layer, a technique which proves to
be effective for legal documents. Furthermore, we utilize weakly supervised
learning by means of a curriculum learning strategy, effectively demonstrating
the improved performance of a deep learning model. This is in contrast to the
conventional models which are only able to utilize the limited number of
expensive manually-annotated samples by legal experts. Although the methods
presented in this work tackles the task of risk of confusion for trademarks, it
is straightforward to extend them to other fields of law, or more generally, to
other similar high-stakes application scenarios.</span>

                    <span>In this paper, we address the problem of automatic repair of software
vulnerabilities with deep learning. The major problem with data-driven
vulnerability repair is that the few existing datasets of known confirmed
vulnerabilities consist of only a few thousand examples. However, training a
deep learning model often requires hundreds of thousands of examples. In this
work, we leverage the intuition that the bug fixing task and the vulnerability
fixing task are related and that the knowledge learned from bug fixes can be
transferred to fixing vulnerabilities. In the machine learning community, this
technique is called transfer learning. In this paper, we propose an approach
for repairing security vulnerabilities named VRepair which is based on transfer
learning. VRepair is first trained on a large bug fix corpus and is then tuned
on a vulnerability fix dataset, which is an order of magnitude smaller. In our
experiments, we show that a model trained only on a bug fix corpus can already
fix some vulnerabilities. Then, we demonstrate that transfer learning improves
the ability to repair vulnerable C functions. We also show that the transfer
learning model performs better than a model trained with a denoising task and
fine-tuned on the vulnerability fixing task. To sum up, this paper shows that
transfer learning works well for repairing security vulnerabilities in C
compared to learning on a small dataset.</span>

                    <span>This paper considers the problem of differentially private semi-supervised
transfer and multi-task learning. The notion of \emph{membership-mapping} has
been developed using measure theory basis to learn data representation via a
fuzzy membership function. An alternative conception of deep autoencoder,
referred to as \emph{Conditionally Deep Membership-Mapping Autoencoder
(CDMMA)}, is considered for transferrable deep learning. Under
practice-oriented settings, an analytical solution for the learning of CDMMA
can be derived by means of variational optimization. The paper proposes a
transfer and multi-task learning approach that combines CDMMA with a tailored
noise adding mechanism to achieve a given level of privacy-loss bound with the
minimum perturbation of the data. Numerous experiments were carried out using
MNIST, USPS, Office, and Caltech256 datasets to verify the competitive robust
performance of the proposed methodology.</span>

                    <span>Although Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have shown incredible performance in
perceptive and control tasks, several trustworthy issues are still open. One of
the most discussed topics is the existence of adversarial perturbations, which
has opened an interesting research line on provable techniques capable of
quantifying the robustness of a given input. In this regard, the Euclidean
distance of the input from the classification boundary denotes a well-proved
robustness assessment as the minimal affordable adversarial perturbation.
Unfortunately, computing such a distance is highly complex due the non-convex
nature of NNs. Despite several methods have been proposed to address this
issue, to the best of our knowledge, no provable results have been presented to
estimate and bound the error committed. This paper addresses this issue by
proposing two lightweight strategies to find the minimal adversarial
perturbation. Differently from the state-of-the-art, the proposed approach
allows formulating an error estimation theory of the approximate distance with
respect to the theoretical one. Finally, a substantial set of experiments is
reported to evaluate the performance of the algorithms and support the
theoretical findings. The obtained results show that the proposed strategies
approximate the theoretical distance for samples close to the classification
boundary, leading to provable robustness guarantees against any adversarial
attacks.</span>

                    <span>Recent work has shown the potential of the use of audio data in screening for
COVID-19. However, very little exploration has been done of monitoring disease
progression, especially recovery in COVID-19 through audio. Tracking disease
progression characteristics and patterns of recovery could lead to tremendous
insights and more timely treatment or treatment adjustment, as well as better
resources management in health care systems.

The primary objective of this study is to explore the potential of
longitudinal audio dynamics for COVID-19 monitoring using sequential deep
learning techniques, focusing on prediction of disease progression and,
especially, recovery trend prediction. We analysed crowdsourced respiratory
audio data from 212 individuals over 5 days to 385 days, alongside their
self-reported COVID-19 test results. We first explore the benefits of capturing
longitudinal dynamics of audio biomarkers for COVID-19 detection. The strong
performance, yielding an AUC-ROC of 0.79, sensitivity of 0.75 and specificity
of 0.70, supports the effectiveness of the approach compared to methods that do
not leverage longitudinal dynamics. We further examine the predicted disease
progression trajectory, which displays high consistency with the longitudinal
test results with a correlation of 0.76 in the test cohort, and 0.86 in a
subset of the test cohort with 12 participants who report disease recovery.

Our findings suggest that monitoring COVID-19 progression via longitudinal
audio data has enormous potential in the tracking of individuals&#x27; disease
progression and recovery.</span>

                    <span>The Sliced-Wasserstein distance (SW) is being increasingly used in machine
learning applications as an alternative to the Wasserstein distance and offers
significant computational and statistical benefits. Since it is defined as an
expectation over random projections, SW is commonly approximated by Monte
Carlo. We adopt a new perspective to approximate SW by making use of the
concentration of measure phenomenon: under mild assumptions, one-dimensional
projections of a high-dimensional random vector are approximately Gaussian.
Based on this observation, we develop a simple deterministic approximation for
SW. Our method does not require sampling a number of random projections, and is
therefore both accurate and easy to use compared to the usual Monte Carlo
approximation. We derive nonasymptotical guarantees for our approach, and show
that the approximation error goes to zero as the dimension increases, under a
weak dependence condition on the data distribution. We validate our theoretical
findings on synthetic datasets, and illustrate the proposed approximation on a
generative modeling problem.</span>

                    <span>A novel instance-based method for the classification of
electroencephalography (EEG) signals is presented and evaluated in this paper.
The non-stationary nature of the EEG signals, coupled with the demanding task
of pattern recognition with limited training data as well as the potentially
noisy signal acquisition conditions, have motivated the work reported in this
study. The proposed adaptive template enhancement mechanism transforms the
feature-level instances by treating each feature dimension separately, hence
resulting in improved class separation and better query-class matching. The
proposed new instance-based learning algorithm is compared with a few related
algorithms in a number of scenarios. A clinical grade 64-electrode EEG
database, as well as a low-quality (high-noise level) EEG database obtained
with a low-cost system using a single dry sensor have been used for evaluations
in biometric person recognition. The proposed approach demonstrates
significantly improved classification accuracy in both identification and
verification scenarios. In particular, this new method is seen to provide a
good classification performance for noisy EEG data, indicating its potential
suitability for a wide range of applications.</span>

                    <span>Machine learning (ML) has been pervasively researched nowadays and it has
been applied in many aspects of real life. Nevertheless, issues of model and
data still accompany the development of ML. For instance, training of
traditional ML models is limited to the access of data sets, which are
generally proprietary; published ML models may soon be out of date without
update of new data and continuous training; malicious data contributors may
upload wrongly labeled data that leads to undesirable training results; and the
abuse of private data and data leakage also exit. With the utilization of
blockchain, an emerging and swiftly developing technology, these problems can
be efficiently solved. In this paper, we conduct a survey of the convergence of
collaborative ML and blockchain. We investigate different ways of combination
of these two technologies, and their fields of application. We also discuss the
limitations of current research and their future directions.</span>

                    <span>Machine learning models may involve decision boundaries that change over time
due to updates to rules and regulations, such as in loan approvals or claims
management. However, in such scenarios, it may take time for sufficient
training data to accumulate in order to retrain the model to reflect the new
decision boundaries. While work has been done to reinforce existing decision
boundaries, very little has been done to cover these scenarios where decision
boundaries of the ML models should change in order to reflect new rules. In
this paper, we focus on user-provided feedback rules as a way to expedite the
ML models update process, and we formally introduce the problem of
pre-processing training data to edit an ML model in response to feedback rules
such that once the model is retrained on the pre-processed data, its decision
boundaries align more closely with the rules. To solve this problem, we propose
a novel data augmentation method, the Feedback Rule-Based Oversampling
Technique. Extensive experiments using different ML models and real world
datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the method, in particular the benefit
of augmentation and the ability to handle many feedback rules.</span>

                    <span>Understanding how the predictions of deep learning models are formed during
the training process is crucial to improve model performance and fix model
defects, especially when we need to investigate nontrivial training strategies
such as active learning, and track the root cause of unexpected training
results such as performance degeneration.

In this work, we propose a time-travelling visual solution DeepVisualInsight
(DVI), aiming to manifest the spatio-temporal causality while training a deep
learning image classifier. The spatio-temporal causality demonstrates how the
gradient-descent algorithm and various training data sampling techniques can
influence and reshape the layout of learnt input representation and the
classification boundaries in consecutive epochs. Such causality allows us to
observe and analyze the whole learning process in the visible low dimensional
space. Technically, we propose four spatial and temporal properties and design
our visualization solution to satisfy them. These properties preserve the most
important information when inverse-)projecting input samples between the
visible low-dimensional and the invisible high-dimensional space, for causal
analyses. Our extensive experiments show that, comparing to baseline
approaches, we achieve the best visualization performance regarding the
spatial/temporal properties and visualization efficiency. Moreover, our case
study shows that our visual solution can well reflect the characteristics of
various training scenarios, showing good potential of DVI as a debugging tool
for analyzing deep learning training processes.</span>

                    <span>Finding different solutions to the same problem is a key aspect of
intelligence associated with creativity and adaptation to novel situations. In
reinforcement learning, a set of diverse policies can be useful for
exploration, transfer, hierarchy, and robustness. We propose Diverse Successive
Policies, a method for discovering policies that are diverse in the space of
Successor Features, while assuring that they are near optimal. We formalize the
problem as a Constrained Markov Decision Process (CMDP) where the goal is to
find policies that maximize diversity, characterized by an intrinsic diversity
reward, while remaining near-optimal with respect to the extrinsic reward of
the MDP. We also analyze how recently proposed robustness and discrimination
rewards perform and find that they are sensitive to the initialization of the
procedure and may converge to sub-optimal solutions. To alleviate this, we
propose new explicit diversity rewards that aim to minimize the correlation
between the Successor Features of the policies in the set. We compare the
different diversity mechanisms in the DeepMind Control Suite and find that the
type of explicit diversity we are proposing is important to discover distinct
behavior, like for example different locomotion patterns.</span>

                    <span>The effect of bias on hypothesis formation is characterized for an automated
data-driven projection pursuit neural network to extract and select features
for binary classification of data streams. This intelligent exploratory process
partitions a complete vector state space into disjoint subspaces to create
working hypotheses quantified by similarities and differences observed between
two groups of labeled data streams. Data streams are typically time sequenced,
and may exhibit complex spatio-temporal patterns. For example, given atomic
trajectories from molecular dynamics simulation, the machine&#x27;s task is to
quantify dynamical mechanisms that promote function by comparing protein
mutants, some known to function while others are nonfunctional. Utilizing
synthetic two-dimensional molecules that mimic the dynamics of functional and
nonfunctional proteins, biases are identified and controlled in both the
machine learning model and selected training data under different contexts. The
refinement of a working hypothesis converges to a statistically robust
multivariate perception of the data based on a context-dependent perspective.
Including diverse perspectives during data exploration enhances
interpretability of the multivariate characterization of similarities and
differences.</span>

                    <span>A variety of modern applications exhibit multi-view multi-label learning,
where each sample has multi-view features, and multiple labels are correlated
via common views. In recent years, several methods have been proposed to cope
with it and achieve much success, but still suffer from two key problems: 1)
lack the ability to deal with the incomplete multi-view weak-label data, in
which only a subset of features and labels are provided for each sample; 2)
ignore the presence of noisy views and tail labels usually occurring in
real-world problems. In this paper, we propose a novel method, named CEMENT, to
overcome the limitations. For 1), CEMENT jointly embeds incomplete views and
weak labels into distinct low-dimensional subspaces, and then correlates them
via Hilbert-Schmidt Independence Criterion (HSIC). For 2), CEMEMT adaptively
learns the weights of embeddings to capture noisy views, and explores an
additional sparse component to model tail labels, making the low-rankness
available in the multi-label setting. We develop an alternating algorithm to
solve the proposed optimization problem. Experimental results on seven
real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.</span>

                    <span>Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder which results
in altered behavior, social development, and communication patterns. In past
years, autism prevalence has tripled, with 1 in 54 children now affected. Given
that traditional diagnosis is a lengthy, labor-intensive process, significant
attention has been given to developing systems that automatically screen for
autism. Prosody abnormalities are among the clearest signs of autism, with
affected children displaying speech idiosyncrasies including echolalia,
monotonous intonation, atypical pitch, and irregular linguistic stress
patterns. In this work, we present a suite of machine learning approaches to
detect autism in self-recorded speech audio captured from autistic and
neurotypical (NT) children in home environments. We consider three methods to
detect autism in child speech: first, Random Forests trained on extracted audio
features (including Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients); second, convolutional
neural networks (CNNs) trained on spectrograms; and third, fine-tuned wav2vec
2.0--a state-of-the-art Transformer-based ASR model. We train our classifiers
on our novel dataset of cellphone-recorded child speech audio curated from
Stanford&#x27;s Guess What? mobile game, an app designed to crowdsource videos of
autistic and neurotypical children in a natural home environment. The Random
Forest classifier achieves 70% accuracy, the fine-tuned wav2vec 2.0 model
achieves 77% accuracy, and the CNN achieves 79% accuracy when classifying
children&#x27;s audio as either ASD or NT. Our models were able to predict autism
status when training on a varied selection of home audio clips with
inconsistent recording quality, which may be more generalizable to real world
conditions. These results demonstrate that machine learning methods offer
promise in detecting autism automatically from speech without specialized
equipment.</span>

                    <span>Many online platforms today (such as Amazon, Netflix, Spotify, LinkedIn, and
AirBnB) can be thought of as two-sided markets with producers and customers of
goods and services. Traditionally, recommendation services in these platforms
have focused on maximizing customer satisfaction by tailoring the results
according to the personalized preferences of individual customers. However, our
investigation reinforces the fact that such customer-centric design of these
services may lead to unfair distribution of exposure to the producers, which
may adversely impact their well-being. On the other hand, a pure
producer-centric design might become unfair to the customers. As more and more
people are depending on such platforms to earn a living, it is important to
ensure fairness to both producers and customers. In this work, by mapping a
fair personalized recommendation problem to a constrained version of the
problem of fairly allocating indivisible goods, we propose to provide fairness
guarantees for both sides. Formally, our proposed {\em FairRec} algorithm
guarantees Maxi-Min Share ($\alpha$-MMS) of exposure for the producers, and
Envy-Free up to One Item (EF1) fairness for the customers. Extensive
evaluations over multiple real-world datasets show the effectiveness of {\em
FairRec} in ensuring two-sided fairness while incurring a marginal loss in
overall recommendation quality. Finally, we present a modification of FairRec
(named as FairRecPlus) that at the cost of additional computation time,
improves the recommendation performance for the customers, while maintaining
the same fairness guarantees.</span>

leads to hate crimes and violence against individuals and communities. The
multifaceted nature of hate speech and its real-world impact have already
piqued the interest of the data mining and machine learning communities.
Despite our best efforts, hate speech remains an evasive issue for researchers
and practitioners alike. This article presents methodological challenges that
hinder building automated hate mitigation systems. These challenges inspired
our work in the broader area of combating hateful content on the web. We
discuss a series of our proposed solutions to limit the spread of hate speech

                    <span>Prokaryotic viruses, which infect bacteria and archaea, are key players in
microbial communities. Predicting the hosts of prokaryotic viruses helps
decipher the dynamic relationship between microbes. Although there are
experimental methods for host identification, they are either labor-intensive
or require the cultivation of the host cells, creating a need for computational
host prediction. Despite some promising results, computational host prediction
remains a challenge because of the limited known interactions and the sheer
amount of sequenced phages by high-throughput sequencing technologies. The
state-of-the-art methods can only achieve 43% accuracy at the species level.
This work presents CHERRY, a tool formulating host prediction as link
prediction in a knowledge graph. As a virus-prokaryotic interaction prediction
tool, CHERRY can be applied to predict hosts for newly discovered viruses and
also the viruses infecting antibiotic-resistant bacteria. We demonstrated the
utility of CHERRY for both applications and compared its performance with the
state-of-the-art methods in different scenarios. To our best knowledge, CHERRY
has the highest accuracy in identifying virus-prokaryote interactions. It
outperforms all the existing methods at the species level with an accuracy
increase of 37%. In addition, CHERRY&#x27;s performance is more stable on short
contigs than other tools.</span>

                    <span>E-commerce provides rich multimodal data that is barely leveraged in
practice. One aspect of this data is a category tree that is being used in
search and recommendation. However, in practice, during a user&#x27;s session there
is often a mismatch between a textual and a visual representation of a given
category. Motivated by the problem, we introduce the task of category-to-image
retrieval in e-commerce and propose a model for the task, CLIP-ITA. The model
leverages information from multiple modalities (textual, visual, and attribute
modality) to create product representations. We explore how adding information
from multiple modalities (textual, visual, and attribute modality) impacts the
model&#x27;s performance. In particular, we observe that CLIP-ITA significantly
outperforms a comparable model that leverages only the visual modality and a
comparable model that leverages the visual and attribute modality.</span>

                    <span>While Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) algorithms, i.e., there are only
labeled data from source domains, have been actively studied in recent years,
most algorithms and theoretical results focus on Single-source Unsupervised
Domain Adaptation (SUDA). However, in the practical scenario, labeled data can
be typically collected from multiple diverse sources, and they might be
different not only from the target domain but also from each other. Thus,
domain adapters from multiple sources should not be modeled in the same way.
Recent deep learning based Multi-source Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (MUDA)
algorithms focus on extracting common domain-invariant representations for all
domains by aligning distribution of all pairs of source and target domains in a
common feature space. However, it is often very hard to extract the same
domain-invariant representations for all domains in MUDA. In addition, these
methods match distributions without considering domain-specific decision
boundaries between classes. To solve these problems, we propose a new framework
with two alignment stages for MUDA which not only respectively aligns the
distributions of each pair of source and target domains in multiple specific
feature spaces, but also aligns the outputs of classifiers by utilizing the
domain-specific decision boundaries. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
method can achieve remarkable results on popular benchmark datasets for image
classification.</span>

                    <span>Deployment of modern TinyML tasks on small battery-constrained IoT devices
requires high computational energy efficiency. Analog In-Memory Computing (IMC)
using non-volatile memory (NVM) promises major efficiency improvements in deep
neural network (DNN) inference and serves as on-chip memory storage for DNN
weights. However, IMC&#x27;s functional flexibility limitations and their impact on
performance, energy, and area efficiency are not yet fully understood at the
system level. To target practical end-to-end IoT applications, IMC arrays must
be enclosed in heterogeneous programmable systems, introducing new system-level
challenges which we aim at addressing in this work. We present a heterogeneous
tightly-coupled clustered architecture integrating 8 RISC-V cores, an in-memory
computing accelerator (IMA), and digital accelerators. We benchmark the system
on a highly heterogeneous workload such as the Bottleneck layer from a
MobileNetV2, showing 11.5x performance and 9.5x energy efficiency improvements,
compared to highly optimized parallel execution on the cores. Furthermore, we
explore the requirements for end-to-end inference of a full mobile-grade DNN
(MobileNetV2) in terms of IMC array resources, by scaling up our heterogeneous
architecture to a multi-array accelerator. Our results show that our solution,
on the end-to-end inference of the MobileNetV2, is one order of magnitude
better in terms of execution latency than existing programmable architectures
and two orders of magnitude better than state-of-the-art heterogeneous
solutions integrating in-memory computing analog cores.</span>

                    <span>Spectral-based graph neural networks (SGNNs) have been attracting increasing
attention in graph representation learning. However, existing SGNNs are limited
in implementing graph filters with rigid transforms (e.g., graph Fourier or
predefined graph wavelet transforms) and cannot adapt to signals residing on
graphs and tasks at hand. In this paper, we propose a novel class of graph
neural networks that realizes graph filters with adaptive graph wavelets.
Specifically, the adaptive graph wavelets are learned with neural
network-parameterized lifting structures, where structure-aware attention-based
lifting operations (i.e., prediction and update operations) are developed to
jointly consider graph structures and node features. We propose to lift based
on diffusion wavelets to alleviate the structural information loss induced by
partitioning non-bipartite graphs. By design, the locality and sparsity of the
resulting wavelet transform as well as the scalability of the lifting structure
are guaranteed. We further derive a soft-thresholding filtering operation by
learning sparse graph representations in terms of the learned wavelets,
yielding a localized, efficient, and scalable wavelet-based graph filters. To
ensure that the learned graph representations are invariant to node
permutations, a layer is employed at the input of the networks to reorder the
nodes according to their local topology information. We evaluate the proposed
networks in both node-level and graph-level representation learning tasks on
benchmark citation and bioinformatics graph datasets. Extensive experiments
demonstrate the superiority of the proposed networks over existing SGNNs in
terms of accuracy, efficiency, and scalability.</span>

                    <span>Recent data-extraction attacks have exposed that language models can memorize
some training samples verbatim. This is a vulnerability that can compromise the
privacy of the model&#x27;s training data. In this work, we introduce SubMix: a
practical protocol for private next-token prediction designed to prevent
privacy violations by language models that were fine-tuned on a private corpus
after pre-training on a public corpus. We show that SubMix limits the leakage
of information that is unique to any individual user in the private corpus via
a relaxation of group differentially private prediction. Importantly, SubMix
admits a tight, data-dependent privacy accounting mechanism, which allows it to
thwart existing data-extraction attacks while maintaining the utility of the
language model. SubMix is the first protocol that maintains privacy even when
publicly releasing tens of thousands of next-token predictions made by large
transformer-based models such as GPT-2.</span>

                    <span>It is fundamental for science and technology to be able to predict chemical
reactions and their properties. To achieve such skills, it is important to
develop good representations of chemical reactions, or good deep learning
architectures that can learn such representations automatically from the data.
There is currently no universal and widely adopted method for robustly
representing chemical reactions. Most existing methods suffer from one or more
drawbacks, such as: (1) lacking universality; (2) lacking robustness; (3)
lacking interpretability; or (4) requiring excessive manual pre-processing.
Here we exploit graph-based representations of molecular structures to develop
and test a hypergraph attention neural network approach to solve at once the
reaction representation and property-prediction problems, alleviating the
aforementioned drawbacks. We evaluate this hypergraph representation in three
experiments using three independent data sets of chemical reactions. In all
experiments, the hypergraph-based approach matches or outperforms other
representations and their corresponding models of chemical reactions while
yielding interpretable multi-level representations.</span>

                    <span>Real economies can be seen as a sequential imperfect-information game with
many heterogeneous, interacting strategic agents of various agent types, such
as consumers, firms, and governments. Dynamic general equilibrium models are
common economic tools to model the economic activity, interactions, and
outcomes in such systems. However, existing analytical and computational
methods struggle to find explicit equilibria when all agents are strategic and
interact, while joint learning is unstable and challenging. Amongst others, a
key reason is that the actions of one economic agent may change the reward
function of another agent, e.g., a consumer&#x27;s expendable income changes when
firms change prices or governments change taxes. We show that multi-agent deep
reinforcement learning (RL) can discover stable solutions that are epsilon-Nash
equilibria for a meta-game over agent types, in economic simulations with many
agents, through the use of structured learning curricula and efficient GPU-only
simulation and training. Conceptually, our approach is more flexible and does
not need unrealistic assumptions, e.g., market clearing, that are commonly used
for analytical tractability. Our GPU implementation enables training and
analyzing economies with a large number of agents within reasonable time
frames, e.g., training completes within a day. We demonstrate our approach in
real-business-cycle models, a representative family of DGE models, with 100
worker-consumers, 10 firms, and a government who taxes and redistributes. We
validate the learned meta-game epsilon-Nash equilibria through approximate
best-response analyses, show that RL policies align with economic intuitions,
and that our approach is constructive, e.g., by explicitly learning a spectrum
of meta-game epsilon-Nash equilibria in open RBC models.</span>

                    <span>Approximating wind flows using computational fluid dynamics (CFD) methods can
be time-consuming. Creating a tool for interactively designing prototypes while
observing the wind flow change requires simpler models to simulate faster.
Instead of running numerical approximations resulting in detailed calculations,
data-driven methods and deep learning might be able to give similar results in
a fraction of the time. This work rephrases the problem from computing 3D flow
fields using CFD to a 2D image-to-image translation-based problem on the
building footprints to predict the flow field at pedestrian height level. We
investigate the use of generative adversarial networks (GAN), such as Pix2Pix
[1] and CycleGAN [2] representing state-of-the-art for image-to-image
translation task in various domains as well as U-Net autoencoder [3]. The
models can learn the underlying distribution of a dataset in a data-driven
manner, which we argue can help the model learn the underlying
Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) equations from CFD. We experiment on
novel simulated datasets on various three-dimensional bluff-shaped buildings
with and without height information. Moreover, we present an extensive
qualitative and quantitative evaluation of the generated images for a selection
of models and compare their performance with the simulations delivered by CFD.
We then show that adding positional data to the input can produce more accurate
results by proposing a general framework for injecting such information on the
different architectures. Furthermore, we show that the models performances
improve by applying attention mechanisms and spectral normalization to
facilitate stable training.</span>

                    <span>In this work we use variational inference to quantify the degree of
uncertainty in deep learning model predictions of radio galaxy classification.
We show that the level of model posterior variance for individual test samples
is correlated with human uncertainty when labelling radio galaxies. We explore
the model performance and uncertainty calibration for a variety of different
weight priors and suggest that a sparse prior produces more well-calibrated
uncertainty estimates. Using the posterior distributions for individual
weights, we show that we can prune 30% of the fully-connected layer weights
without significant loss of performance by removing the weights with the lowest
signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). We demonstrate that a larger degree of pruning can
be achieved using a Fisher information based ranking, but we note that both
pruning methods affect the uncertainty calibration for Fanaroff-Riley type I
and type II radio galaxies differently. Finally we show that, like other work
in this field, we experience a cold posterior effect, whereby the posterior
must be down-weighted to achieve good predictive performance. We examine
whether adapting the cost function to accommodate model misspecification can
compensate for this effect, but find that it does not make a significant
difference. We also examine the effect of principled data augmentation and find
that this improves upon the baseline but also does not compensate for the
observed effect. We interpret this as the cold posterior effect being due to
the overly effective curation of our training sample leading to likelihood
misspecification, and raise this as a potential issue for Bayesian deep
learning approaches to radio galaxy classification in future.</span>

                    <span>Corrupted labels and class imbalance are commonly encountered in practically
collected training data, which easily leads to over-fitting of deep neural
networks (DNNs). Existing approaches alleviate these issues by adopting a
sample re-weighting strategy, which is to re-weight sample by designing
weighting function. However, it is only applicable for training data containing
only either one type of data biases. In practice, however, biased samples with
corrupted labels and of tailed classes commonly co-exist in training data. How
to handle them simultaneously is a key but under-explored problem. In this
paper, we find that these two types of biased samples, though have similar
transient loss, have distinguishable trend and characteristics in loss curves,
which could provide valuable priors for sample weight assignment. Motivated by
this, we delve into the loss curves and propose a novel probe-and-allocate
training strategy: In the probing stage, we train the network on the whole
biased training data without intervention, and record the loss curve of each
sample as an additional attribute; In the allocating stage, we feed the
resulting attribute to a newly designed curve-perception network, named
CurveNet, to learn to identify the bias type of each sample and assign proper
weights through meta-learning adaptively. The training speed of meta learning
also blocks its application. To solve it, we propose a method named skip layer
meta optimization (SLMO) to accelerate training speed by skipping the bottom
layers. Extensive synthetic and real experiments well validate the proposed
method, which achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple challenging
benchmarks.</span>

image, audio, video, etc., are showing better performance in comparison with
individual modalities (i.e., unimodal) systems. Multimodal machine learning
involves multiple aspects: representation, translation, alignment, fusion, and
co-learning. In the current state of multimodal machine learning, the
assumptions are that all modalities are present, aligned, and noiseless during
training and testing time. However, in real-world tasks, typically, it is
observed that one or more modalities are missing, noisy, lacking annotated
data, have unreliable labels, and are scarce in training or testing and or
both. This challenge is addressed by a learning paradigm called multimodal
co-learning. The modeling of a (resource-poor) modality is aided by exploiting
knowledge from another (resource-rich) modality using transfer of knowledge
between modalities, including their representations and predictive models.
Co-learning being an emerging area, there are no dedicated reviews explicitly
focusing on all challenges addressed by co-learning. To that end, in this work,
we provide a comprehensive survey on the emerging area of multimodal
co-learning that has not been explored in its entirety yet. We review
implementations that overcome one or more co-learning challenges without
explicitly considering them as co-learning challenges. We present the
comprehensive taxonomy of multimodal co-learning based on the challenges
addressed by co-learning and associated implementations. The various techniques
employed to include the latest ones are reviewed along with some of the
applications and datasets. Our final goal is to discuss challenges and
perspectives along with the important ideas and directions for future work that
we hope to be beneficial for the entire research community focusing on this
exciting domain.</span>

                    <span>Molecular dynamics simulations are a cornerstone in science, allowing to
investigate from the system&#x27;s thermodynamics to analyse intricate molecular
interactions. In general, to create extended molecular trajectories can be a
computationally expensive process, for example, when running $ab-initio$
simulations. Hence, repeating such calculations to either obtain more accurate
thermodynamics or to get a higher resolution in the dynamics generated by a
fine-grained quantum interaction can be time- and computationally-consuming. In
this work, we explore different machine learning (ML) methodologies to increase
the resolution of molecular dynamics trajectories on-demand within a
post-processing step. As a proof of concept, we analyse the performance of
bi-directional neural networks such as neural ODEs, Hamiltonian networks,
recurrent neural networks and LSTMs, as well as the uni-directional variants as
a reference, for molecular dynamics simulations (here: the MD17 dataset). We
have found that Bi-LSTMs are the best performing models; by utilizing the local
time-symmetry of thermostated trajectories they can even learn long-range
correlations and display high robustness to noisy dynamics across molecular
complexity. Our models can reach accuracies of up to 10$^{-4}$ angstroms in
trajectory interpolation, while faithfully reconstructing several full cycles
of unseen intricate high-frequency molecular vibrations, rendering the
comparison between the learned and reference trajectories indistinguishable.
The results reported in this work can serve (1) as a baseline for larger
systems, as well as (2) for the construction of better MD integrators.</span>

                    <span>Change detection methods applied to monitoring key infrastructure like
airport runways represent an important capability for disaster relief and urban
planning. The present work identifies two generative adversarial networks (GAN)
architectures that translate reversibly between plausible runway maps and
satellite imagery. We illustrate the training capability using paired images
(satellite-map) from the same point of view and using the Pix2Pix architecture
or conditional GANs. In the absence of available pairs, we likewise show that
CycleGAN architectures with four network heads (discriminator-generator pairs)
can also provide effective style transfer from raw image pixels to outline or
feature maps. To emphasize the runway and tarmac boundaries, we experimentally
show that the traditional grey-tan map palette is not a required training input
but can be augmented by higher contrast mapping palettes (red-black) for
sharper runway boundaries. We preview a potentially novel use case (called
&quot;sketch2satellite&quot;) where a human roughly draws the current runway boundaries
and automates the machine output of plausible satellite images. Finally, we
identify examples of faulty runway maps where the published satellite and
mapped runways disagree but an automated update renders the correct map using
GANs.</span>

                    <span>In image classification, it is often expensive and time-consuming to acquire
sufficient labels. To solve this problem, domain adaptation often provides an
attractive option given a large amount of labeled data from a similar nature
but different domain. Existing approaches mainly align the distributions of
representations extracted by a single structure and the representations may
only contain partial information, e.g., only contain part of the saturation,
brightness, and hue information. Along this line, we propose
Multi-Representation Adaptation which can dramatically improve the
classification accuracy for cross-domain image classification and specially
aims to align the distributions of multiple representations extracted by a
hybrid structure named Inception Adaptation Module (IAM). Based on this, we
present Multi-Representation Adaptation Network (MRAN) to accomplish the
cross-domain image classification task via multi-representation alignment which
can capture the information from different aspects. In addition, we extend
Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) to compute the adaptation loss. Our approach can
be easily implemented by extending most feed-forward models with IAM, and the
network can be trained efficiently via back-propagation. Experiments conducted
on three benchmark image datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of MRAN. The
code has been available at https://github.com/easezyc/deep-transfer-learning.</span>

                    <span>Clinical 12-lead electrocardiography (ECG) is one of the most widely
encountered kinds of biosignals. Despite the increased availability of public
ECG datasets, label scarcity remains a central challenge in the field.
Self-supervised learning represents a promising way to alleviate this issue. In
this work, we put forward the first comprehensive assessment of self-supervised
representation learning from clinical 12-lead ECG data. To this end, we adapt
state-of-the-art self-supervised methods based on instance discrimination and
latent forecasting to the ECG domain. In a first step, we learn contrastive
representations and evaluate their quality based on linear evaluation
performance on a recently established, comprehensive, clinical ECG
classification task. In a second step, we analyze the impact of self-supervised
pretraining on finetuned ECG classifiers as compared to purely supervised
performance. For the best-performing method, an adaptation of contrastive
predictive coding, we find a linear evaluation performance only 0.5% below
supervised performance. For the finetuned models, we find improvements in
downstream performance of roughly 1% compared to supervised performance, label
efficiency, as well as robustness against physiological noise. This work
clearly establishes the feasibility of extracting discriminative
representations from ECG data via self-supervised learning and the numerous
advantages when finetuning such representations on downstream tasks as compared
to purely supervised training. As first comprehensive assessment of its kind in
the ECG domain carried out exclusively on publicly available datasets, we hope
to establish a first step towards reproducible progress in the rapidly evolving
field of representation learning for biosignals.</span>

                    <span>Retinal vascular diseases affect the well-being of human body and sometimes
provide vital signs of otherwise undetected bodily damage. Recently, deep
learning techniques have been successfully applied for detection of diabetic
retinopathy (DR). The main obstacle of applying deep learning techniques to
detect most other retinal vascular diseases is the limited amount of data
available. In this paper, we propose a transfer learning technique that aims to
utilize the feature similarities for detecting retinal vascular diseases. We
choose the well-studied DR detection as a source task and identify the early
detection of retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) as the target task. Our
experimental results demonstrate that our DR-pretrained approach dominates in
all metrics the conventional ImageNet-pretrained transfer learning approach,
currently adopted in medical image analysis. Moreover, our approach is more
robust with respect to the stochasticity in the training process and with
respect to reduced training samples. This study suggests the potential of our
proposed transfer learning approach for a broad range of retinal vascular
diseases or pathologies, where data is limited.</span>

                    <span>Centralized Training for Decentralized Execution, where training is done in a
centralized offline fashion, has become a popular solution paradigm in
Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning. Many such methods take the form of
actor-critic with state-based critics, since centralized training allows access
to the true system state, which can be useful during training despite not being
available at execution time. State-based critics have become a common empirical
choice, albeit one which has had limited theoretical justification or analysis.
In this paper, we show that state-based critics can introduce bias in the
policy gradient estimates, potentially undermining the asymptotic guarantees of
the algorithm. We also show that, even if the state-based critics do not
introduce any bias, they can still result in a larger gradient variance,
contrary to the common intuition. Finally, we show the effects of the theories
in practice by comparing different forms of centralized critics on a wide range
of common benchmarks, and detail how various environmental properties are
related to the effectiveness of different types of critics.</span>

                    <span>Kendall transformation is a conversion of an ordered feature into a vector of
pairwise order relations between individual values. This way, it preserves
ranking of observations and represents it in a categorical form.

Such transformation allows for generalisation of methods requiring strictly
categorical input, especially in the limit of small number of observations,
when discretisation becomes problematic. In particular, many approaches of
information theory can be directly applied to Kendall-transformed continuous
data without relying on differential entropy or any additional parameters.
Moreover, by filtering information to this contained in ranking, Kendall
transformation leads to a better robustness at a reasonable cost of dropping
sophisticated interactions which are anyhow unlikely to be correctly estimated.

In bivariate analysis, Kendall transformation can be related to popular
non-parametric methods, showing the soundness of the approach. The paper also
demonstrates its efficiency in multivariate problems, as well as provides an
example analysis of a real-world data.</span>

                    <span>We investigate the use of a multi-agent multi-armed bandit (MA-MAB) setting
for modeling repeated Cournot oligopoly games, where the firms acting as agents
choose from the set of arms representing production quantity (a discrete
value). Agents interact with separate and independent bandit problems. In this
formulation, each agent makes sequential choices among arms to maximize its own
reward. Agents do not have any information about the environment; they can only
see their own rewards after taking an action. However, the market demand is a
stationary function of total industry output, and random entry or exit from the
market is not allowed. Given these assumptions, we found that an
$\epsilon$-greedy approach offers a more viable learning mechanism than other
traditional MAB approaches, as it does not require any additional knowledge of
the system to operate. We also propose two novel approaches that take advantage
of the ordered action space: $\epsilon$-greedy+HL and $\epsilon$-greedy+EL.
These new approaches help firms to focus on more profitable actions by
eliminating less profitable choices and hence are designed to optimize the
exploration. We use computer simulations to study the emergence of various
equilibria in the outcomes and do the empirical analysis of joint cumulative
regrets.</span>

with more complex structures to capture the features within the receptive

similar way as CNN. We also give a training algorithm for the proposed model.

                    <span>Supervised operator learning is an emerging machine learning paradigm with
applications to modeling the evolution of spatio-temporal dynamical systems and
approximating general black-box relationships between functional data. We
propose a novel operator learning method, LOCA (Learning Operators with Coupled
Attention), motivated from the recent success of the attention mechanism. In
our architecture, the input functions are mapped to a finite set of features
which are then averaged with attention weights that depend on the output query
locations. By coupling these attention weights together with an integral
transform, LOCA is able to explicitly learn correlations in the target output
functions, enabling us to approximate nonlinear operators even when the number
of output function in the training set measurements is very small. Our
formulation is accompanied by rigorous approximation theoretic guarantees on
the universal expressiveness of the proposed model. Empirically, we evaluate
the performance of LOCA on several operator learning scenarios involving
systems governed by ordinary and partial differential equations, as well as a
black-box climate prediction problem. Through these scenarios we demonstrate
state of the art accuracy, robustness with respect to noisy input data, and a
consistently small spread of errors over testing data sets, even for
out-of-distribution prediction tasks.</span>

                    <span>Conventional machine learning (ML) relies heavily on manual design from
machine learning experts to decide learning tasks, data, models, optimization
algorithms, and evaluation metrics, which is labor-intensive, time-consuming,
and cannot learn autonomously like humans. In education science, self-directed
learning, where human learners select learning tasks and materials on their own
without requiring hands-on guidance, has been shown to be more effective than
passive teacher-guided learning. Inspired by the concept of self-directed human
learning, we introduce the principal concept of Self-directed Machine Learning
(SDML) and propose a framework for SDML. Specifically, we design SDML as a
self-directed learning process guided by self-awareness, including internal
awareness and external awareness. Our proposed SDML process benefits from self
task selection, self data selection, self model selection, self optimization
strategy selection and self evaluation metric selection through self-awareness
without human guidance. Meanwhile, the learning performance of the SDML process
serves as feedback to further improve self-awareness. We propose a mathematical
formulation for SDML based on multi-level optimization. Furthermore, we present
case studies together with potential applications of SDML, followed by
discussing future research directions. We expect that SDML could enable
machines to conduct human-like self-directed learning and provide a new
perspective towards artificial general intelligence.</span>

                    <span>We develop a theoretical analysis for special neural network architectures,
termed operator recurrent neural networks, for approximating nonlinear
functions whose inputs are linear operators. Such functions commonly arise in
solution algorithms for inverse boundary value problems. Traditional neural
networks treat input data as vectors, and thus they do not effectively capture
the multiplicative structure associated with the linear operators that
correspond to the data in such inverse problems. We therefore introduce a new
family that resembles a standard neural network architecture, but where the
input data acts multiplicatively on vectors. Motivated by compact operators
appearing in boundary control and the analysis of inverse boundary value
problems for the wave equation, we promote structure and sparsity in selected
weight matrices in the network. After describing this architecture, we study
its representation properties as well as its approximation properties. We
furthermore show that an explicit regularization can be introduced that can be
derived from the mathematical analysis of the mentioned inverse problems, and
which leads to certain guarantees on the generalization properties. We observe
that the sparsity of the weight matrices improves the generalization estimates.
Lastly, we discuss how operator recurrent networks can be viewed as a deep
learning analogue to deterministic algorithms such as boundary control for
reconstructing the unknown wavespeed in the acoustic wave equation from
boundary measurements.</span>

                    <span>To this day, a variety of approaches for providing local interpretability of
black-box machine learning models have been introduced. Unfortunately, all of
these methods suffer from one or more of the following deficiencies: They are
either difficult to understand themselves, they work on a per-feature basis and
ignore the dependencies between features and/or they only focus on those
features asserting the decision made by the model. To address these points,
this work introduces a reinforcement learning-based approach called Monte Carlo
tree search for eXplainable Artificial Intelligent (McXai) to explain the
decisions of any black-box classification model (classifier). Our method
leverages Monte Carlo tree search and models the process of generating
explanations as two games. In one game, the reward is maximized by finding
feature sets that support the decision of the classifier, while in the second
game, finding feature sets leading to alternative decisions maximizes the
reward. The result is a human friendly representation as a tree structure, in
which each node represents a set of features to be studied with smaller
explanations at the top of the tree. Our experiments show, that the features
found by our method are more informative with respect to classifications than
those found by classical approaches like LIME and SHAP. Furthermore, by also
identifying misleading features, our approach is able to guide towards improved
robustness of the black-box model in many situations.</span>

                    <span>Semantic segmentation of brain tumors is a fundamental medical image analysis
task involving multiple MRI imaging modalities that can assist clinicians in
diagnosing the patient and successively studying the progression of the
malignant entity. In recent years, Fully Convolutional Neural Networks (FCNNs)
approaches have become the de facto standard for 3D medical image segmentation.
The popular &quot;U-shaped&quot; network architecture has achieved state-of-the-art
performance benchmarks on different 2D and 3D semantic segmentation tasks and
across various imaging modalities. However, due to the limited kernel size of
convolution layers in FCNNs, their performance of modeling long-range
information is sub-optimal, and this can lead to deficiencies in the
segmentation of tumors with variable sizes. On the other hand, transformer
models have demonstrated excellent capabilities in capturing such long-range
information in multiple domains, including natural language processing and
computer vision. Inspired by the success of vision transformers and their
variants, we propose a novel segmentation model termed Swin UNEt TRansformers
(Swin UNETR). Specifically, the task of 3D brain tumor semantic segmentation is
reformulated as a sequence to sequence prediction problem wherein multi-modal
input data is projected into a 1D sequence of embedding and used as an input to
a hierarchical Swin transformer as the encoder. The swin transformer encoder
extracts features at five different resolutions by utilizing shifted windows
for computing self-attention and is connected to an FCNN-based decoder at each
resolution via skip connections. We have participated in BraTS 2021
segmentation challenge, and our proposed model ranks among the top-performing
approaches in the validation phase. Code: https://monai.io/research/swin-unetr</span>

                    <span>Data-driven AI systems can lead to discrimination on the basis of protected
attributes like gender or race. One reason for this behavior is the encoded
societal biases in the training data (e.g., females are underrepresented),
which is aggravated in the presence of unbalanced class distributions (e.g.,
&quot;granted&quot; is the minority class). State-of-the-art fairness-aware machine
learning approaches focus on preserving the \emph{overall} classification
accuracy while improving fairness. In the presence of class-imbalance, such
methods may further aggravate the problem of discrimination by denying an
already underrepresented group (e.g., \textit{females}) the fundamental rights
of equal social privileges (e.g., equal credit opportunity).

To this end, we propose AdaFair, a fairness-aware boosting ensemble that
changes the data distribution at each round, taking into account not only the
class errors but also the fairness-related performance of the model defined
cumulatively based on the partial ensemble. Except for the in-training boosting
of the group discriminated over each round, AdaFair directly tackles imbalance
during the post-training phase by optimizing the number of ensemble learners
for balanced error performance (BER). AdaFair can facilitate different
parity-based fairness notions and mitigate effectively discriminatory outcomes.
Our experiments show that our approach can achieve parity in terms of
statistical parity, equal opportunity, and disparate mistreatment while
maintaining good predictive performance for all classes.</span>

                    <span>Various approaches have been proposed for out-of-distribution (OOD) detection
by augmenting models, input examples, training sets, and optimization
objectives. Deviating from existing work, we have a simple hypothesis that
standard off-the-shelf models may already contain sufficient information about
the training set distribution which can be leveraged for reliable OOD
detection. Our empirical study on validating this hypothesis, which measures
the model activation&#x27;s mean for OOD and in-distribution (ID) mini-batches,
surprisingly finds that activation means of OOD mini-batches consistently
deviate more from those of the training data. In addition, training data&#x27;s
activation means can be computed offline efficiently or retrieved from batch
normalization layers as a &#x60;free lunch&#x27;. Based upon this observation, we propose
a novel metric called Neural Mean Discrepancy (NMD), which compares neural
means of the input examples and training data. Leveraging the simplicity of
NMD, we propose an efficient OOD detector that computes neural means by a
standard forward pass followed by a lightweight classifier. Extensive
experiments show that NMD outperforms state-of-the-art OOD approaches across
multiple datasets and model architectures in terms of both detection accuracy
and computational cost.</span>

                    <span>Profile guided optimization is an effective technique for improving the
optimization ability of compilers based on dynamic behavior, but collecting
profile data is expensive, cumbersome, and requires regular updating to remain
fresh. We present a novel statistical approach to inferring branch
probabilities that improves the performance of programs that are compiled
without profile guided optimizations. We perform offline training using
information that is collected from a large corpus of binaries that have branch
probabilities information. The learned model is used by the compiler to predict
the branch probabilities of regular uninstrumented programs, which the compiler
can then use to inform optimization decisions. We integrate our technique
directly in LLVM, supplementing the existing human-engineered compiler
heuristics. We evaluate our technique on a suite of benchmarks, demonstrating
some gains over compiling without profile information. In deployment, our
technique requires no profiling runs and has negligible effect on compilation
time.</span>

                    <span>With the explosive growth of the e-commerce industry, detecting online
transaction fraud in real-world applications has become increasingly important
to the development of e-commerce platforms. The sequential behavior history of
users provides useful information in differentiating fraudulent payments from
regular ones. Recently, some approaches have been proposed to solve this
sequence-based fraud detection problem. However, these methods usually suffer
from two problems: the prediction results are difficult to explain and the
exploitation of the internal information of behaviors is insufficient. To
tackle the above two problems, we propose a Hierarchical Explainable Network
(HEN) to model users&#x27; behavior sequences, which could not only improve the
performance of fraud detection but also make the inference process
interpretable. Meanwhile, as e-commerce business expands to new domains, e.g.,
new countries or new markets, one major problem for modeling user behavior in
fraud detection systems is the limitation of data collection, e.g., very few
data/labels available. Thus, in this paper, we further propose a transfer
framework to tackle the cross-domain fraud detection problem, which aims to
transfer knowledge from existing domains (source domains) with enough and
mature data to improve the performance in the new domain (target domain). Our
proposed method is a general transfer framework that could not only be applied
upon HEN but also various existing models in the Embedding &amp; MLP paradigm.
Based on 90 transfer task experiments, we also demonstrate that our transfer
framework could not only contribute to the cross-domain fraud detection task
with HEN, but also be universal and expandable for various existing models.</span>

                    <span>Machine learning, with its advances in Deep Learning has shown great
potential in analysing time series in the past. However, in many scenarios,
additional information is available that can potentially improve predictions,
by incorporating it into the learning methods. This is crucial for data that
arises from e.g., sensor networks that contain information about sensor
locations. Then, such spatial information can be exploited by modeling it via
graph structures, along with the sequential (time) information. Recent advances
in adapting Deep Learning to graphs have shown promising potential in various
graph-related tasks. However, these methods have not been adapted for time
series related tasks to a great extent. Specifically, most attempts have
essentially consolidated around Spatial-Temporal Graph Neural Networks for time
series forecasting with small sequence lengths. Generally, these architectures
are not suited for regression or classification tasks that contain large
sequences of data. Therefore, in this work, we propose an architecture capable
of processing these long sequences in a multivariate time series regression
task, using the benefits of Graph Neural Networks to improve predictions. Our
model is tested on two seismic datasets that contain earthquake waveforms,
where the goal is to predict intensity measurements of ground shaking at a set
of stations. Our findings demonstrate promising results of our approach, which
are discussed in depth with an additional ablation study.</span>

                    <span>Value function factorization via centralized training and decentralized
execution is promising for solving cooperative multi-agent reinforcement tasks.
One of the approaches in this area, QMIX, has become state-of-the-art and
achieved the best performance on the StarCraft II micromanagement benchmark.
However, the monotonic-mixing of per agent estimates in QMIX is known to
restrict the joint action Q-values it can represent, as well as the
insufficient global state information for single agent value function
estimation, often resulting in suboptimality. To this end, we present LSF-SAC,
a novel framework that features a variational inference-based
information-sharing mechanism as extra state information to assist individual
agents in the value function factorization. We demonstrate that such latent
individual state information sharing can significantly expand the power of
value function factorization, while fully decentralized execution can still be
maintained in LSF-SAC through a soft-actor-critic design. We evaluate LSF-SAC
on the StarCraft II micromanagement challenge and demonstrate that it
outperforms several state-of-the-art methods in challenging collaborative
tasks. We further set extensive ablation studies for locating the key factors
accounting for its performance improvements. We believe that this new insight
can lead to new local value estimation methods and variational deep learning
algorithms. A demo video and code of implementation can be found at

industry. However, as the literature on graph learning booms with a vast number
of emerging methods and techniques, it becomes increasingly difficult to
manually design the optimal machine learning algorithm for different
graph-related tasks. To tackle the challenge, automated graph machine learning,
which aims at discovering the best hyper-parameter and neural architecture
configuration for different graph tasks/data without manual design, is gaining
an increasing number of attentions from the research community. In this paper,
we extensively discuss automated graph machine approaches, covering
hyper-parameter optimization (HPO) and neural architecture search (NAS) for
graph machine learning. We briefly overview existing libraries designed for
either graph machine learning or automated machine learning respectively, and
further in depth introduce AutoGL, our dedicated and the world&#x27;s first

we share our insights on future research directions for automated graph machine
learning. This paper is the first systematic and comprehensive discussion of

                    <span>Even though many semantic segmentation methods exist that are able to perform
well on many medical datasets, often, they are not designed for direct use in
clinical practice. The two main concerns are generalization to unseen data with
a different visual appearance, e.g., images acquired using a different scanner,
and efficiency in terms of computation time and required Graphics Processing
Unit (GPU) memory. In this work, we employ a multi-organ segmentation model
based on the SpatialConfiguration-Net (SCN), which integrates prior knowledge
of the spatial configuration among the labelled organs to resolve spurious
responses in the network outputs. Furthermore, we modified the architecture of
the segmentation model to reduce its memory footprint as much as possible
without drastically impacting the quality of the predictions. Lastly, we
implemented a minimal inference script for which we optimized both, execution
time and required GPU memory.</span>

                    <span>Weighting strategy prevails in machine learning. For example, a common
approach in robust machine learning is to exert lower weights on samples which
are likely to be noisy or quite hard. This study reveals another undiscovered
strategy, namely, compensating. Various incarnations of compensating have been
utilized but it has not been explicitly revealed. Learning with compensating is
called compensation learning and a systematic taxonomy is constructed for it in
this study. In our taxonomy, compensation learning is divided on the basis of
the compensation targets, directions, inference manners, and granularity
levels. Many existing learning algorithms including some classical ones can be
viewed or understood at least partially as compensation techniques.
Furthermore, a family of new learning algorithms can be obtained by plugging
the compensation learning into existing learning algorithms. Specifically, two
concrete new learning algorithms are proposed for robust machine learning.
Extensive experiments on image classification and text sentiment analysis
verify the effectiveness of the two new algorithms. Compensation learning can
also be used in other various learning scenarios, such as imbalance learning,
clustering, regression, and so on.</span>

research studies in domains ranging from public health to the social sciences.
There is also growing interest by governments and businesses to use population
data to support data-driven decision making. The massive size of such databases
is often mistaken as a guarantee for valid inferences on the population of
interest. However, population data have characteristics that make them
challenging to use, including various assumptions being made how such data were
collected and what types of processing have been applied to them. Furthermore,
the full potential of population data can often only be unlocked when such data
are linked to other databases, a process that adds fresh challenges. This
article discusses a diverse range of misconceptions about population data that
we believe anybody who works with such data needs to be aware of. Many of these
misconceptions are not well documented in scientific publications but only
discussed anecdotally among researchers and practitioners. We conclude with a

with a little computational complexity. In this work, we investigate how
multi-lingual Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) networks can be scaled up with
a simple routing algorithm in order to achieve better accuracy. More
specifically, we apply the sparsely-gated MoE technique to two types of

(T-T). We demonstrate through a set of ASR experiments on multiple language
data that the MoE networks can reduce the relative word error rates by 16.3%

                    <span>Air access networks have been recognized as a significant driver of various
Internet of Things (IoT) services and applications. In particular, the aerial
computing network infrastructure centered on the Internet of Drones has set off
a new revolution in automatic image recognition. This emerging technology
relies on sharing ground truth labeled data between Unmanned Aerial Vehicle
(UAV) swarms to train a high-quality automatic image recognition model.
However, such an approach will bring data privacy and data availability
challenges. To address these issues, we first present a Semi-supervised
Federated Learning (SSFL) framework for privacy-preserving UAV image
recognition. Specifically, we propose model parameters mixing strategy to
improve the naive combination of FL and semi-supervised learning methods under
two realistic scenarios (labels-at-client and labels-at-server), which is
referred to as Federated Mixing (FedMix). Furthermore, there are significant
differences in the number, features, and distribution of local data collected
by UAVs using different camera modules in different environments, i.e.,
statistical heterogeneity. To alleviate the statistical heterogeneity problem,
we propose an aggregation rule based on the frequency of the client&#x27;s
participation in training, namely the FedFreq aggregation rule, which can
adjust the weight of the corresponding local model according to its frequency.
Numerical results demonstrate that the performance of our proposed method is
significantly better than those of the current baseline and is robust to
different non-IID levels of client data.</span>

                    <span>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are recently proposed neural network structures
for the processing of graph-structured data. Due to their employed neighbor
aggregation strategy, existing GNNs focus on capturing node-level information
and neglect high-level information. Existing GNNs therefore suffer from
representational limitations caused by the Local Permutation Invariance (LPI)
problem. To overcome these limitations and enrich the features captured by
GNNs, we propose a novel GNN framework, referred to as the Two-level GNN
(TL-GNN). This merges subgraph-level information with node-level information.
Moreover, we provide a mathematical analysis of the LPI problem which
demonstrates that subgraph-level information is beneficial to overcoming the
problems associated with LPI. A subgraph counting method based on the dynamic
programming algorithm is also proposed, and this has time complexity is O(n^3),
n is the number of nodes of a graph. Experiments show that TL-GNN outperforms
existing GNNs and achieves state-of-the-art performance.</span>

                    <span>Many few-shot learning approaches have been designed under the meta-learning
framework, which learns from a variety of learning tasks and generalizes to new
tasks. These meta-learning approaches achieve the expected performance in the
scenario where all samples are drawn from the same distributions (i.i.d.
observations). However, in real-world applications, few-shot learning paradigm
often suffers from data shift, i.e., samples in different tasks, even in the
same task, could be drawn from various data distributions. Most existing
few-shot learning approaches are not designed with the consideration of data
shift, and thus show downgraded performance when data distribution shifts.
However, it is non-trivial to address the data shift problem in few-shot
learning, due to the limited number of labeled samples in each task. Targeting
at addressing this problem, we propose a novel metric-based meta-learning
framework to extract task-specific representations and task-shared
representations with the help of knowledge graph. The data shift within/between
tasks can thus be combated by the combination of task-shared and task-specific
representations. The proposed model is evaluated on popular benchmarks and two
constructed new challenging datasets. The evaluation results demonstrate its
remarkable performance.</span>

                    <span>Deep neural networks (DNNs) are known to be vulnerable to adversarial
attacks. A range of defense methods have been proposed to train adversarially
robust DNNs, among which adversarial training has demonstrated promising
results. However, despite preliminary understandings developed for adversarial
training, it is still not clear, from the architectural perspective, what
configurations can lead to more robust DNNs. In this paper, we address this gap
via a comprehensive investigation on the impact of network width and depth on
the robustness of adversarially trained DNNs. Specifically, we make the
following key observations: 1) more parameters (higher model capacity) does not
necessarily help adversarial robustness; 2) reducing capacity at the last stage
(the last group of blocks) of the network can actually improve adversarial
robustness; and 3) under the same parameter budget, there exists an optimal
architectural configuration for adversarial robustness. We also provide a
theoretical analysis explaning why such network configuration can help
robustness. These architectural insights can help design adversarially robust
DNNs. Code is available at \url{https://github.com/HanxunH/RobustWRN}.</span>

                    <span>Modern generative models achieve excellent quality in a variety of tasks
including image or text generation and chemical molecule modeling. However,
existing methods often lack the essential ability to generate examples with
requested properties, such as the age of the person in the photo or the weight
of the generated molecule. Incorporating such additional conditioning factors
would require rebuilding the entire architecture and optimizing the parameters
from scratch. Moreover, it is difficult to disentangle selected attributes so
that to perform edits of only one attribute while leaving the others unchanged.
To overcome these limitations we propose PluGeN (Plugin Generative Network), a
simple yet effective generative technique that can be used as a plugin to
pre-trained generative models. The idea behind our approach is to transform the
entangled latent representation using a flow-based module into a
multi-dimensional space where the values of each attribute are modeled as an
independent one-dimensional distribution. In consequence, PluGeN can generate
new samples with desired attributes as well as manipulate labeled attributes of
existing examples. Due to the disentangling of the latent representation, we
are even able to generate samples with rare or unseen combinations of
attributes in the dataset, such as a young person with gray hair, men with
make-up, or women with beards. We combined PluGeN with GAN and VAE models and
applied it to conditional generation and manipulation of images and chemical
molecule modeling. Experiments demonstrate that PluGeN preserves the quality of
backbone models while adding the ability to control the values of labeled
attributes.</span>

                    <span>In the paper, we propose a class of accelerated zeroth-order and first-order
momentum methods for both nonconvex mini-optimization and minimax-optimization.
Specifically, we propose a new accelerated zeroth-order momentum (Acc-ZOM)
method for black-box mini-optimization. Moreover, we prove that our Acc-ZOM
method achieves a lower query complexity of $\tilde{O}(d^{3/4}\epsilon^{-3})$
for finding an $\epsilon$-stationary point, which improves the best known
result by a factor of $O(d^{1/4})$ where $d$ denotes the variable dimension. In
particular, the Acc-ZOM does not require large batches required in the existing
zeroth-order stochastic algorithms. Meanwhile, we propose an accelerated
\textbf{zeroth-order} momentum descent ascent (Acc-ZOMDA) method for
\textbf{black-box} minimax-optimization, which obtains a query complexity of
$\tilde{O}((d_1+d_2)^{3/4}\kappa_y^{4.5}\epsilon^{-3})$ without large batches
for finding an $\epsilon$-stationary point, where $d_1$ and $d_2$ denote
variable dimensions and $\kappa_y$ is condition number. Moreover, we propose an
accelerated \textbf{first-order} momentum descent ascent (Acc-MDA) method for
\textbf{white-box} minimax optimization, which has a gradient complexity of
$\tilde{O}(\kappa_y^{4.5}\epsilon^{-3})$ without large batches for finding an
$\epsilon$-stationary point. In particular, our Acc-MDA can obtain a lower
gradient complexity of $\tilde{O}(\kappa_y^{2.5}\epsilon^{-3})$ with a batch
size $O(\kappa_y^4)$. Extensive experimental results on the black-box
adversarial attack to deep neural networks (DNNs) and poisoning attack

                    <span>Deep metric learning aims to learn an embedding space where the distance
between data reflects their class equivalence, even when their classes are
unseen during training. However, the limited number of classes available in
training precludes generalization of the learned embedding space. Motivated by
this, we introduce a new data augmentation approach that synthesizes novel
classes and their embedding vectors. Our approach can provide rich semantic
information to an embedding model and improve its generalization by augmenting
training data with novel classes unavailable in the original data. We implement
this idea by learning and exploiting a conditional generative model, which,
given a class label and a noise, produces a random embedding vector of the
class. Our proposed generator allows the loss to use richer class relations by
augmenting realistic and diverse classes, resulting in better generalization to
unseen samples. Experimental results on public benchmark datasets demonstrate
that our method clearly enhances the performance of proxy-based losses.</span>

                    <span>Comparing structured objects such as graphs is a fundamental operation
involved in many learning tasks. To this end, the Gromov-Wasserstein (GW)
distance, based on Optimal Transport (OT), has proven to be successful in
handling the specific nature of the associated objects. More specifically,
through the nodes connectivity relations, GW operates on graphs, seen as
probability measures over specific spaces. At the core of OT is the idea of
conservation of mass, which imposes a coupling between all the nodes from the
two considered graphs. We argue in this paper that this property can be
detrimental for tasks such as graph dictionary or partition learning, and we
relax it by proposing a new semi-relaxed Gromov-Wasserstein divergence. Aside
from immediate computational benefits, we discuss its properties, and show that
it can lead to an efficient graph dictionary learning algorithm. We empirically
demonstrate its relevance for complex tasks on graphs such as partitioning,
clustering and completion.</span>

                    <span>Despite Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have achieved remarkable accuracy,
whether the results are trustworthy is still unexplored. Previous studies
suggest that many modern neural networks are over-confident on the predictions,
however, surprisingly, we discover that GNNs are primarily in the opposite
direction, i.e., GNNs are under-confident. Therefore, the confidence
calibration for GNNs is highly desired. In this paper, we propose a novel
trustworthy GNN model by designing a topology-aware post-hoc calibration
function. Specifically, we first verify that the confidence distribution in a
graph has homophily property, and this finding inspires us to design a
calibration GNN model (CaGCN) to learn the calibration function. CaGCN is able
to obtain a unique transformation from logits of GNNs to the calibrated
confidence for each node, meanwhile, such transformation is able to preserve
the order between classes, satisfying the accuracy-preserving property.
Moreover, we apply the calibration GNN to self-training framework, showing that
more trustworthy pseudo labels can be obtained with the calibrated confidence
and further improve the performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate the
effectiveness of our proposed model in terms of both calibration and accuracy.</span>

                    <span>Recent advances in deep reinforcement learning (RL) have led to considerable
progress in many 2-player zero-sum games, such as Go, Poker and Starcraft. The
purely adversarial nature of such games allows for conceptually simple and
principled application of RL methods. However real-world settings are
many-agent, and agent interactions are complex mixtures of common-interest and
competitive aspects. We consider Diplomacy, a 7-player board game designed to
accentuate dilemmas resulting from many-agent interactions. It also features a
large combinatorial action space and simultaneous moves, which are challenging
for RL algorithms. We propose a simple yet effective approximate best response
operator, designed to handle large combinatorial action spaces and simultaneous
moves. We also introduce a family of policy iteration methods that approximate
fictitious play. With these methods, we successfully apply RL to Diplomacy: we
show that our agents convincingly outperform the previous state-of-the-art, and
game theoretic equilibrium analysis shows that the new process yields
consistent improvements.</span>

a single perturbation to fool the target DNN for most images. With the focus on
UAP against deep classifiers, this survey summarizes the recent progress on

                    <span>The literature on robustness towards common corruptions shows no consensus on
whether adversarial training can improve the performance in this setting.
First, we show that, when used with an appropriately selected perturbation
radius, $\ell_p$ adversarial training can serve as a strong baseline against
common corruptions improving both accuracy and calibration. Then we explain why
adversarial training performs better than data augmentation with simple
Gaussian noise which has been observed to be a meaningful baseline on common
corruptions. Related to this, we identify the $\sigma$-overfitting phenomenon
when Gaussian augmentation overfits to a particular standard deviation used for
training which has a significant detrimental effect on common corruption
accuracy. We discuss how to alleviate this problem and then how to further
enhance $\ell_p$ adversarial training by introducing an efficient relaxation of
adversarial training with learned perceptual image patch similarity as the
distance metric. Through experiments on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet-100, we show that
our approach does not only improve the $\ell_p$ adversarial training baseline
but also has cumulative gains with data augmentation methods such as AugMix,
DeepAugment, ANT, and SIN, leading to state-of-the-art performance on common
corruptions.

                    <span>Light field (LF) imaging, which captures both spatial and angular information
of a scene, is undoubtedly beneficial to numerous applications. Although
various techniques have been proposed for LF acquisition, achieving both
angularly and spatially high-resolution LF remains a technology challenge. In
this paper, a learning-based approach applied to 3D epipolar image (EPI) is
proposed to reconstruct high-resolution LF. Through a 2-stage super-resolution
framework, the proposed approach effectively addresses various LF
super-resolution (SR) problems, i.e., spatial SR, angular SR, and
angular-spatial SR. While the first stage provides flexible options to
up-sample EPI volume to the desired resolution, the second stage, which
consists of a novel EPI volume-based refinement network (EVRN), substantially
enhances the quality of the high-resolution EPI volume. An extensive evaluation
on 90 challenging synthetic and real-world light field scenes from 7 published
datasets shows that the proposed approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods
to a large extend for both spatial and angular super-resolution problem, i.e.,
an average peak signal to noise ratio improvement of more than 2.0 dB, 1.4 dB,
and 3.14 dB in spatial SR $\times 2$, spatial SR $\times 4$, and angular SR
respectively. The reconstructed 4D light field demonstrates a balanced
performance distribution across all perspective images and presents superior
visual quality compared to the previous works.</span>

                    <span>The rapid mutation of the influenza virus threatens public health.
Reassortment among viruses with different hosts can lead to a fatal pandemic.
However, it is difficult to detect the original host of the virus during or
after an outbreak as influenza viruses can circulate between different species.
Therefore, early and rapid detection of the viral host would help reduce the
further spread of the virus. We use various machine learning models with
features derived from the position-specific scoring matrix (PSSM) and features
learned from word embedding and word encoding to infer the origin host of
viruses. The results show that the performance of the PSSM-based model reaches
the MCC around 95%, and the F1 around 96%. The MCC obtained using the model
with word embedding is around 96%, and the F1 is around 97%.</span>

                    <span>We apply deep metric learning for the first time to the prob-lem of
classifying planktic foraminifer shells on microscopic images. This species
recognition task is an important information source and scientific pillar for
reconstructing past climates. All foraminifer CNN recognition pipelines in the
literature produce black-box classifiers that lack visualisation options for
human experts and cannot be applied to open set problems. Here, we benchmark
metric learning against these pipelines, produce the first scientific
visualisation of the phenotypic planktic foraminifer morphology space, and
demonstrate that metric learning can be used to cluster species unseen during
training. We show that metric learning out-performs all published CNN-based
state-of-the-art benchmarks in this domain. We evaluate our approach on the
34,640 expert-annotated images of the Endless Forams public library of 35
modern planktic foraminifera species. Our results on this data show leading 92%
accuracy (at 0.84 F1-score) in reproducing expert labels on withheld test data,
and 66.5% accuracy (at 0.70 F1-score) when clustering species never encountered
in training. We conclude that metric learning is highly effective for this
domain and serves as an important tool towards expert-in-the-loop automation of
microfossil identification. Key code, network weights, and data splits are
published with this paper for full reproducibility.</span>

                    <span>One principal impediment in the successful deployment of AI-based
Computer-Aided Diagnosis (CAD) systems in clinical workflows is their lack of
transparent decision making. Although commonly used eXplainable AI methods
provide some insight into opaque algorithms, such explanations are usually
convoluted and not readily comprehensible except by highly trained experts. The
explanation of decisions regarding the malignancy of skin lesions from
dermoscopic images demands particular clarity, as the underlying medical
problem definition is itself ambiguous. This work presents ExAID (Explainable
AI for Dermatology), a novel framework for biomedical image analysis, providing
multi-modal concept-based explanations consisting of easy-to-understand textual
explanations supplemented by visual maps justifying the predictions. ExAID
relies on Concept Activation Vectors to map human concepts to those learnt by
arbitrary Deep Learning models in latent space, and Concept Localization Maps
to highlight concepts in the input space. This identification of relevant
concepts is then used to construct fine-grained textual explanations
supplemented by concept-wise location information to provide comprehensive and
coherent multi-modal explanations. All information is comprehensively presented
in a diagnostic interface for use in clinical routines. An educational mode
provides dataset-level explanation statistics and tools for data and model
exploration to aid medical research and education. Through rigorous
quantitative and qualitative evaluation of ExAID, we show the utility of
multi-modal explanations for CAD-assisted scenarios even in case of wrong
predictions. We believe that ExAID will provide dermatologists an effective
screening tool that they both understand and trust. Moreover, it will be the
basis for similar applications in other biomedical imaging fields.</span>

                    <span>In recent years, proposed studies on time-series anomaly detection (TAD)
report high F1 scores on benchmark TAD datasets, giving the impression of clear
improvements in TAD. However, most studies apply a peculiar evaluation protocol
called point adjustment (PA) before scoring. In this paper, we theoretically
and experimentally reveal that the PA protocol has a great possibility of
overestimating the detection performance; that is, even a random anomaly score
can easily turn into a state-of-the-art TAD method. Therefore, the comparison
of TAD methods after applying the PA protocol can lead to misguided rankings.
Furthermore, we question the potential of existing TAD methods by showing that
an untrained model obtains comparable detection performance to the existing
methods even when PA is forbidden. Based on our findings, we propose a new
baseline and an evaluation protocol. We expect that our study will help a
rigorous evaluation of TAD and lead to further improvement in future
researches.</span>

                    <span>For each partition of a data set into a given number of parts there is a
partition such that every part is as much as possible a good model (an
&quot;algorithmic sufficient statistic&quot;) for the data in that part. Since this can
be done for every number between one and the number of data, the result is a
function, the cluster structure function. It maps the number of parts of a
partition to values related to the deficiencies of being good models by the
parts. Such a function starts with a value at least zero for no partition of
the data set and descents to zero for the partition of the data set into
singleton parts. The optimal clustering is the one chosen to minimize the
cluster structure function. The theory behind the method is expressed in
algorithmic information theory (Kolmogorov complexity). In practice the
Kolmogorov complexities involved are approximated by a concrete compressor. We
give examples using real data sets: the MNIST handwritten digits and the
segmentation of real cells as used in stem cell research.</span>

                    <span>Imbalanced datasets are commonplace in modern machine learning problems. The
presence of under-represented classes or groups with sensitive attributes
results in concerns about generalization and fairness. Such concerns are
further exacerbated by the fact that large capacity deep nets can perfectly fit
the training data and appear to achieve perfect accuracy and fairness during
training, but perform poorly during test. To address these challenges, we
propose AutoBalance, a bi-level optimization framework that automatically
designs a training loss function to optimize a blend of accuracy and
fairness-seeking objectives. Specifically, a lower-level problem trains the
model weights, and an upper-level problem tunes the loss function by monitoring
and optimizing the desired objective over the validation data. Our loss design
enables personalized treatment for classes/groups by employing a parametric
cross-entropy loss and individualized data augmentation schemes. We evaluate
the benefits and performance of our approach for the application scenarios of
imbalanced and group-sensitive classification. Extensive empirical evaluations
demonstrate the benefits of AutoBalance over state-of-the-art approaches. Our
experimental findings are complemented with theoretical insights on loss
function design and the benefits of train-validation split. All code is
available open-source.</span>

                    <span>The field of Continual Learning (CL) seeks to develop algorithms that
accumulate knowledge and skills over time through interaction with
non-stationary environments. In practice, a plethora of evaluation procedures
(settings) and algorithmic solutions (methods) exist, each with their own
potentially disjoint set of assumptions. This variety makes measuring progress
in CL difficult. We propose a taxonomy of settings, where each setting is
described as a set of assumptions. A tree-shaped hierarchy emerges from this
view, where more general settings become the parents of those with more
restrictive assumptions. This makes it possible to use inheritance to share and
reuse research, as developing a method for a given setting also makes it
directly applicable onto any of its children. We instantiate this idea as a
publicly available software framework called Sequoia, which features a wide
variety of settings from both the Continual Supervised Learning (CSL) and
Continual Reinforcement Learning (CRL) domains. Sequoia also includes a growing
suite of methods which are easy to extend and customize, in addition to more
specialized methods from external libraries. We hope that this new paradigm and
its first implementation can help unify and accelerate research in CL. You can

                    <span>We propose Neural Actor (NA), a new method for high-quality synthesis of
humans from arbitrary viewpoints and under arbitrary controllable poses. Our
method is built upon recent neural scene representation and rendering works
which learn representations of geometry and appearance from only 2D images.
While existing works demonstrated compelling rendering of static scenes and
playback of dynamic scenes, photo-realistic reconstruction and rendering of
humans with neural implicit methods, in particular under user-controlled novel
poses, is still difficult. To address this problem, we utilize a coarse body
model as the proxy to unwarp the surrounding 3D space into a canonical pose. A
neural radiance field learns pose-dependent geometric deformations and pose-
and view-dependent appearance effects in the canonical space from multi-view
video input. To synthesize novel views of high fidelity dynamic geometry and
appearance, we leverage 2D texture maps defined on the body model as latent
variables for predicting residual deformations and the dynamic appearance.
Experiments demonstrate that our method achieves better quality than the
state-of-the-arts on playback as well as novel pose synthesis, and can even
generalize well to new poses that starkly differ from the training poses.
Furthermore, our method also supports body shape control of the synthesized
results.</span>

                    <span>We address the problem of monitoring a set of binary stochastic processes and
generating an alert when the number of anomalies among them exceeds a
threshold. For this, the decision-maker selects and probes a subset of the
processes to obtain noisy estimates of their states (normal or anomalous).
Based on the received observations, the decisionmaker first determines whether
to declare that the number of anomalies has exceeded the threshold or to
continue taking observations. When the decision is to continue, it then decides
whether to collect observations at the next time instant or defer it to a later
time. If it chooses to collect observations, it further determines the subset
of processes to be probed. To devise this three-step sequential decision-making
process, we use a Bayesian formulation wherein we learn the posterior
probability on the states of the processes. Using the posterior probability, we
construct a Markov decision process and solve it using deep actor-critic
reinforcement learning. Via numerical experiments, we demonstrate the superior
performance of our algorithm compared to the traditional model-based
algorithms.</span>

                    <span>Continuous-depth neural networks, such as the Neural Ordinary Differential
Equations (ODEs), have aroused a great deal of interest from the communities of
machine learning and data science in recent years, which bridge the connection
between deep neural networks and dynamical systems. In this article, we
introduce a new sort of continuous-depth neural network, called the Neural
Piecewise-Constant Delay Differential Equations (PCDDEs). Here, unlike the
recently proposed framework of the Neural Delay Differential Equations (DDEs),
we transform the single delay into the piecewise-constant delay(s). The Neural
PCDDEs with such a transformation, on one hand, inherit the strength of
universal approximating capability in Neural DDEs. On the other hand, the
Neural PCDDEs, leveraging the contributions of the information from the
multiple previous time steps, further promote the modeling capability without
augmenting the network dimension. With such a promotion, we show that the
Neural PCDDEs do outperform the several existing continuous-depth neural
frameworks on the one-dimensional piecewise-constant delay population dynamics
and real-world datasets, including MNIST, CIFAR10, and SVHN.</span>

                    <span>Learning to optimize the area under the receiver operating characteristics
curve (AUC) performance for imbalanced data has attracted much attention in
recent years. Although there have been several methods of AUC optimization,
scaling up AUC optimization is still an open issue due to its pairwise learning
style. Maximizing AUC in the large-scale dataset can be considered as a
non-convex and expensive problem. Inspired by the characteristic of pairwise
learning, the cheap AUC optimization task with a small-scale dataset sampled
from the large-scale dataset is constructed to promote the AUC accuracy of the
original, large-scale, and expensive AUC optimization task. This paper develops
an evolutionary multitasking framework (termed EMTAUC) to make full use of
information among the constructed cheap and expensive tasks to obtain higher
performance. In EMTAUC, one mission is to optimize AUC from the sampled
dataset, and the other is to maximize AUC from the original dataset. Moreover,
due to the cheap task containing limited knowledge, a strategy for dynamically
adjusting the data structure of inexpensive tasks is proposed to introduce more
knowledge into the multitasking AUC optimization environment. The performance
of the proposed method is evaluated on a series of binary classification
datasets. The experimental results demonstrate that EMTAUC is highly
competitive to single task methods and online methods. Supplementary materials

                    <span>Fusing regression coefficients into homogenous groups can unveil those
coefficients that share a common value within each group. Such groupwise
homogeneity reduces the intrinsic dimension of the parameter space and
unleashes sharper statistical accuracy. We propose and investigate a new
combinatorial grouping approach called $L_0$-Fusion that is amenable to mixed
integer optimization (MIO). On the statistical aspect, we identify a
fundamental quantity called grouping sensitivity that underpins the difficulty
of recovering the true groups. We show that $L_0$-Fusion achieves grouping
consistency under the weakest possible requirement of the grouping sensitivity:
if this requirement is violated, then the minimax risk of group
misspecification will fail to converge to zero. Moreover, we show that in the
high-dimensional regime, one can apply $L_0$-Fusion coupled with a sure
screening set of features without any essential loss of statistical efficiency,
while reducing the computational cost substantially. On the algorithmic aspect,
we provide a MIO formulation for $L_0$-Fusion along with a warm start strategy.
Simulation and real data analysis demonstrate that $L_0$-Fusion exhibits
superiority over its competitors in terms of grouping accuracy.</span>

                    <span>A successful deployment of drones provides an ideal solution for surveillance
systems. Using drones for surveillance can provide access to areas that may be
difficult or impossible to reach by humans or in-land vehicles gathering images
or video recordings of a specific target in their coverage. Therefore, we
introduces a data delivery drone to transfer collected surveillance data in
harsh communication conditions. This paper proposes a Myerson auction-based
asynchronous data delivery in an aerial distributed data platform in
surveillance systems taking battery limitation and long flight constraints into
account. In this paper, multiple delivery drones compete to offer data transfer
to a single fixed-location surveillance drone. Our proposed Myerson
auction-based algorithm, which uses the truthful second-price auction (SPA) as
a baseline, is to maximize the seller&#x27;s revenue while meeting several desirable
properties, i.e., individual rationality and incentive compatibility while
pursuing truthful operations. On top of these SPA-based operations, a deep
learning-based framework is additionally designed for delivery performance
improvements.</span>

                    <span>This paper deals with the following important research question.
Traditionally, the neural network employs non-linear activation functions
concatenated with linear operators to approximate a given physical phenomenon.
They &quot;fill the space&quot; with the concatenations of the activation functions and
linear operators and adjust their coefficients to approximate the physical
phenomena. We claim that it is better to &quot;fill the space&quot; with linear
combinations of smooth higher-order B-splines base functions as employed by
isogeometric analysis and utilize the neural networks to adjust the
coefficients of linear combinations. In other words, the possibilities of using
neural networks for approximating the B-spline base functions&#x27; coefficients and
by approximating the solution directly are evaluated. Solving differential
equations with neural networks has been proposed by Maziar Raissi et al. in
2017 by introducing Physics-informed Neural Networks (PINN), which naturally
encode underlying physical laws as prior information. Approximation of
coefficients using a function as an input leverages the well-known capability
of neural networks being universal function approximators. In essence, in the
PINN approach the network approximates the value of the given field at a given
point. We present an alternative approach, where the physcial quantity is
approximated as a linear combination of smooth B-spline basis functions, and
the neural network approximates the coefficients of B-splines. This research
compares results from the DNN approximating the coefficients of the linear
combination of B-spline basis functions, with the DNN approximating the
solution directly. We show that our approach is cheaper and more accurate when
approximating smooth physical fields.</span>

                    <span>Normalization techniques have become a basic component in modern
convolutional neural networks (ConvNets). In particular, many recent works
demonstrate that promoting the orthogonality of the weights helps train deep
models and improve robustness. For ConvNets, most existing methods are based on
penalizing or normalizing weight matrices derived from concatenating or
flattening the convolutional kernels. These methods often destroy or ignore the
benign convolutional structure of the kernels; therefore, they are often
expensive or impractical for deep ConvNets. In contrast, we introduce a simple
and efficient &quot;Convolutional Normalization&quot; (ConvNorm) method that can fully
exploit the convolutional structure in the Fourier domain and serve as a simple
plug-and-play module to be conveniently incorporated into any ConvNets. Our
method is inspired by recent work on preconditioning methods for convolutional
sparse coding and can effectively promote each layer&#x27;s channel-wise isometry.
Furthermore, we show that our ConvNorm can reduce the layerwise spectral norm
of the weight matrices and hence improve the Lipschitzness of the network,
leading to easier training and improved robustness for deep ConvNets. Applied
to classification under noise corruptions and generative adversarial network
(GAN), we show that the ConvNorm improves the robustness of common ConvNets
such as ResNet and the performance of GAN. We verify our findings via numerical
experiments on CIFAR and ImageNet.</span>

                    <span>We deal with Bayesian generative and discriminative classifiers. Given a
model distribution $p(x, y)$, with the observation $y$ and the target $x$, one
computes generative classifiers by firstly considering $p(x, y)$ and then using
the Bayes rule to calculate $p(x | y)$. A discriminative model is directly
given by $p(x | y)$, which is used to compute discriminative classifiers.
However, recent works showed that the Bayesian Maximum Posterior classifier
defined from the Naive Bayes (NB) or Hidden Markov Chain (HMC), both generative
models, can also match the discriminative classifier definition. Thus, there
are situations in which dividing classifiers into &quot;generative&quot; and
&quot;discriminative&quot; is somewhat misleading. Indeed, such a distinction is rather
related to the way of computing classifiers, not to the classifiers themselves.
We present a general theoretical result specifying how a generative classifier
induced from a generative model can also be computed in a discriminative way
from the same model. Examples of NB and HMC are found again as particular
cases, and we apply the general result to two original extensions of NB, and
two extensions of HMC, one of which being original. Finally, we shortly
illustrate the interest of the new discriminative way of computing classifiers
in the Natural Language Processing (NLP) framework.</span>

                    <span>Fluorescence microscopy has been a significant tool to observe long-term
imaging of embryos (in vivo) growth over time. However, cumulative exposure is
phototoxic to such sensitive live samples. While techniques like light-sheet
fluorescence microscopy (LSFM) allow for reduced exposure, it is not well
suited for deep imaging models. Other computational techniques are
computationally expensive and often lack restoration quality. To address this
challenge, one can use various low-dosage imaging techniques that are developed
to achieve the 3D volume reconstruction using a few slices in the axial
direction (z-axis); however, they often lack restoration quality. Also,
acquiring dense images (with small steps) in the axial direction is
computationally expensive. To address this challenge, we present a compressive
sensing (CS) based approach to fully reconstruct 3D volumes with the same
signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) with less than half of the excitation dosage. We
present the theory and experimentally validate the approach. To demonstrate our
technique, we capture a 3D volume of the RFP labeled neurons in the zebrafish
embryo spinal cord (30um thickness) with the axial sampling of 0.1um using a
confocal microscope. From the results, we observe the CS-based approach
achieves accurate 3D volume reconstruction from less than 20% of the entire
stack optical sections. The developed CS-based methodology in this work can be
easily applied to other deep imaging modalities such as two-photon and
light-sheet microscopy, where reducing sample photo-toxicity is a critical
challenge.</span>

                    <span>Location data collected from mobile devices represent mobility behaviors at
individual and societal levels. These data have important applications ranging
from transportation planning to epidemic modeling. However, issues must be
overcome to best serve these use cases: The data often represent a limited
sample of the population and use of the data jeopardizes privacy.

To address these issues, we present and evaluate a system for generating
synthetic mobility data using a deep recurrent neural network (RNN) which is
trained on real location data. The system takes a population distribution as
input and generates mobility traces for a corresponding synthetic population.

Related generative approaches have not solved the challenges of capturing
both the patterns and variability in individuals&#x27; mobility behaviors over
longer time periods, while also balancing the generation of realistic data with
privacy. Our system leverages RNNs&#x27; ability to generate complex and novel
sequences while retaining patterns from training data. Also, the model
introduces randomness used to calibrate the variation between the synthetic and
real data at the individual level. This is to both capture variability in human
mobility, and protect user privacy.

Location based services (LBS) data from more than 22,700 mobile devices were
used in an experimental evaluation across utility and privacy metrics. We show
the generated mobility data retain the characteristics of the real data, while
varying from the real data at the individual level, and where this amount of
variation matches the variation within the real data.</span>

                    <span>Deep neural networks (DNNs) are known to be vulnerable to adversarial
attacks. A range of defense methods have been proposed to train adversarially
robust DNNs, among which adversarial training has demonstrated promising
results. However, despite preliminary understandings developed for adversarial
training, it is still not clear, from the architectural perspective, what
configurations can lead to more robust DNNs. In this paper, we address this gap
via a comprehensive investigation on the impact of network width and depth on
the robustness of adversarially trained DNNs. Specifically, we make the
following key observations: 1) more parameters (higher model capacity) does not
necessarily help adversarial robustness; 2) reducing capacity at the last stage
(the last group of blocks) of the network can actually improve adversarial
robustness; and 3) under the same parameter budget, there exists an optimal
architectural configuration for adversarial robustness. We also provide a
theoretical analysis explaning why such network configuration can help
robustness. These architectural insights can help design adversarially robust
DNNs. Code is available at \url{https://github.com/HanxunH/RobustWRN}.</span>

                    <span>The Sliced-Wasserstein distance (SW) is being increasingly used in machine
learning applications as an alternative to the Wasserstein distance and offers
significant computational and statistical benefits. Since it is defined as an
expectation over random projections, SW is commonly approximated by Monte
Carlo. We adopt a new perspective to approximate SW by making use of the
concentration of measure phenomenon: under mild assumptions, one-dimensional
projections of a high-dimensional random vector are approximately Gaussian.
Based on this observation, we develop a simple deterministic approximation for
SW. Our method does not require sampling a number of random projections, and is
therefore both accurate and easy to use compared to the usual Monte Carlo
approximation. We derive nonasymptotical guarantees for our approach, and show
that the approximation error goes to zero as the dimension increases, under a
weak dependence condition on the data distribution. We validate our theoretical
findings on synthetic datasets, and illustrate the proposed approximation on a
generative modeling problem.</span>

                    <span>Finding different solutions to the same problem is a key aspect of
intelligence associated with creativity and adaptation to novel situations. In
reinforcement learning, a set of diverse policies can be useful for
exploration, transfer, hierarchy, and robustness. We propose Diverse Successive
Policies, a method for discovering policies that are diverse in the space of
Successor Features, while assuring that they are near optimal. We formalize the
problem as a Constrained Markov Decision Process (CMDP) where the goal is to
find policies that maximize diversity, characterized by an intrinsic diversity
reward, while remaining near-optimal with respect to the extrinsic reward of
the MDP. We also analyze how recently proposed robustness and discrimination
rewards perform and find that they are sensitive to the initialization of the
procedure and may converge to sub-optimal solutions. To alleviate this, we
propose new explicit diversity rewards that aim to minimize the correlation
between the Successor Features of the policies in the set. We compare the
different diversity mechanisms in the DeepMind Control Suite and find that the
type of explicit diversity we are proposing is important to discover distinct
behavior, like for example different locomotion patterns.</span>

                    <span>Fusing regression coefficients into homogenous groups can unveil those
coefficients that share a common value within each group. Such groupwise
homogeneity reduces the intrinsic dimension of the parameter space and
unleashes sharper statistical accuracy. We propose and investigate a new
combinatorial grouping approach called $L_0$-Fusion that is amenable to mixed
integer optimization (MIO). On the statistical aspect, we identify a
fundamental quantity called grouping sensitivity that underpins the difficulty
of recovering the true groups. We show that $L_0$-Fusion achieves grouping
consistency under the weakest possible requirement of the grouping sensitivity:
if this requirement is violated, then the minimax risk of group
misspecification will fail to converge to zero. Moreover, we show that in the
high-dimensional regime, one can apply $L_0$-Fusion coupled with a sure
screening set of features without any essential loss of statistical efficiency,
while reducing the computational cost substantially. On the algorithmic aspect,
we provide a MIO formulation for $L_0$-Fusion along with a warm start strategy.
Simulation and real data analysis demonstrate that $L_0$-Fusion exhibits
superiority over its competitors in terms of grouping accuracy.</span>

                    <span>Clinical 12-lead electrocardiography (ECG) is one of the most widely
encountered kinds of biosignals. Despite the increased availability of public
ECG datasets, label scarcity remains a central challenge in the field.
Self-supervised learning represents a promising way to alleviate this issue. In
this work, we put forward the first comprehensive assessment of self-supervised
representation learning from clinical 12-lead ECG data. To this end, we adapt
state-of-the-art self-supervised methods based on instance discrimination and
latent forecasting to the ECG domain. In a first step, we learn contrastive
representations and evaluate their quality based on linear evaluation
performance on a recently established, comprehensive, clinical ECG
classification task. In a second step, we analyze the impact of self-supervised
pretraining on finetuned ECG classifiers as compared to purely supervised
performance. For the best-performing method, an adaptation of contrastive
predictive coding, we find a linear evaluation performance only 0.5% below
supervised performance. For the finetuned models, we find improvements in
downstream performance of roughly 1% compared to supervised performance, label
efficiency, as well as robustness against physiological noise. This work
clearly establishes the feasibility of extracting discriminative
representations from ECG data via self-supervised learning and the numerous
advantages when finetuning such representations on downstream tasks as compared
to purely supervised training. As first comprehensive assessment of its kind in
the ECG domain carried out exclusively on publicly available datasets, we hope
to establish a first step towards reproducible progress in the rapidly evolving
field of representation learning for biosignals.</span>

                    <span>Kendall transformation is a conversion of an ordered feature into a vector of
pairwise order relations between individual values. This way, it preserves
ranking of observations and represents it in a categorical form.

Such transformation allows for generalisation of methods requiring strictly
categorical input, especially in the limit of small number of observations,
when discretisation becomes problematic. In particular, many approaches of
information theory can be directly applied to Kendall-transformed continuous
data without relying on differential entropy or any additional parameters.
Moreover, by filtering information to this contained in ranking, Kendall
transformation leads to a better robustness at a reasonable cost of dropping
sophisticated interactions which are anyhow unlikely to be correctly estimated.

In bivariate analysis, Kendall transformation can be related to popular
non-parametric methods, showing the soundness of the approach. The paper also
demonstrates its efficiency in multivariate problems, as well as provides an
example analysis of a real-world data.</span>

                    <span>We deal with Bayesian generative and discriminative classifiers. Given a
model distribution $p(x, y)$, with the observation $y$ and the target $x$, one
computes generative classifiers by firstly considering $p(x, y)$ and then using
the Bayes rule to calculate $p(x | y)$. A discriminative model is directly
given by $p(x | y)$, which is used to compute discriminative classifiers.
However, recent works showed that the Bayesian Maximum Posterior classifier
defined from the Naive Bayes (NB) or Hidden Markov Chain (HMC), both generative
models, can also match the discriminative classifier definition. Thus, there
are situations in which dividing classifiers into &quot;generative&quot; and
&quot;discriminative&quot; is somewhat misleading. Indeed, such a distinction is rather
related to the way of computing classifiers, not to the classifiers themselves.
We present a general theoretical result specifying how a generative classifier
induced from a generative model can also be computed in a discriminative way
from the same model. Examples of NB and HMC are found again as particular
cases, and we apply the general result to two original extensions of NB, and
two extensions of HMC, one of which being original. Finally, we shortly
illustrate the interest of the new discriminative way of computing classifiers
in the Natural Language Processing (NLP) framework.</span>

                    <span>Recently, surface electromyogram (EMG) has been proposed as a novel biometric
trait for addressing some key limitations of current biometrics, such as
spoofing and liveness. The EMG signals possess a unique characteristic: they
are inherently different for individuals (biometrics), and they can be
customized to realize multi-length codes or passwords (for example, by
performing different gestures). However, current EMG-based biometric research
has two critical limitations: 1) a small subject pool, compared to other more
established biometric traits, and 2) limited to single-session or single-day
data sets. In this study, forearm and wrist EMG data were collected from 43
participants over three different days with long separation while they
performed static hand and wrist gestures. The multi-day biometric
authentication resulted in a median EER of 0.017 for the forearm setup and
0.025 for the wrist setup, comparable to well-established biometric traits
suggesting consistent performance over multiple days. The presented
large-sample multi-day data set and findings could facilitate further research
on EMG-based biometrics and other gesture recognition-based applications.</span>

                    <span>Statistical divergences (SDs), which quantify the dissimilarity between
probability distributions, are a basic constituent of statistical inference and
machine learning. A modern method for estimating those divergences relies on
parametrizing an empirical variational form by a neural network (NN) and
optimizing over parameter space. Such neural estimators are abundantly used in
practice, but corresponding performance guarantees are partial and call for
further exploration. In particular, there is a fundamental tradeoff between the
two sources of error involved: approximation and empirical estimation. While
the former needs the NN class to be rich and expressive, the latter relies on
controlling complexity. We explore this tradeoff for an estimator based on a
shallow NN by means of non-asymptotic error bounds, focusing on four popular
$\mathsf{f}$-divergences -- Kullback-Leibler, chi-squared, squared Hellinger,
and total variation. Our analysis relies on non-asymptotic function
approximation theorems and tools from empirical process theory. The bounds
reveal the tension between the NN size and the number of samples, and enable to
characterize scaling rates thereof that ensure consistency. For compactly
supported distributions, we further show that neural estimators of the first
three divergences above with appropriate NN growth-rate are near minimax
rate-optimal, achieving the parametric rate up to logarithmic factors.</span>

                    <span>We study the class of first-order locally-balanced Metropolis--Hastings
algorithms introduced in Livingstone &amp; Zanella (2021). To choose a specific
algorithm within the class the user must select a balancing function
$g:\mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$ satisfying $g(t) &#x3D; tg(1/t)$, and a noise
distribution for the proposal increment. Popular choices within the class are
the Metropolis-adjusted Langevin algorithm and the recently introduced Barker
proposal. We first establish a universal limiting optimal acceptance rate of
57% and scaling of $n^{-1/3}$ as the dimension $n$ tends to infinity among all
members of the class under mild smoothness assumptions on $g$ and when the
target distribution for the algorithm is of the product form. In particular we
obtain an explicit expression for the asymptotic efficiency of an arbitrary
algorithm in the class, as measured by expected squared jumping distance. We
then consider how to optimise this expression under various constraints. We
derive an optimal choice of noise distribution for the Barker proposal, optimal
choice of balancing function under a Gaussian noise distribution, and optimal
choice of first-order locally-balanced algorithm among the entire class, which
turns out to depend on the specific target distribution. Numerical simulations
confirm our theoretical findings and in particular show that a bi-modal choice
of noise distribution in the Barker proposal gives rise to a practical
algorithm that is consistently more efficient than the original Gaussian
version.</span>

                    <span>Recent advances in deep reinforcement learning (RL) have led to considerable
progress in many 2-player zero-sum games, such as Go, Poker and Starcraft. The
purely adversarial nature of such games allows for conceptually simple and
principled application of RL methods. However real-world settings are
many-agent, and agent interactions are complex mixtures of common-interest and
competitive aspects. We consider Diplomacy, a 7-player board game designed to
accentuate dilemmas resulting from many-agent interactions. It also features a
large combinatorial action space and simultaneous moves, which are challenging
for RL algorithms. We propose a simple yet effective approximate best response
operator, designed to handle large combinatorial action spaces and simultaneous
moves. We also introduce a family of policy iteration methods that approximate
fictitious play. With these methods, we successfully apply RL to Diplomacy: we
show that our agents convincingly outperform the previous state-of-the-art, and
game theoretic equilibrium analysis shows that the new process yields
consistent improvements.</span>

                    <span>Community detection is one of the most important methodological fields of
network science, and one which has attracted a significant amount of attention
over the past decades. This area deals with the automated division of a network
into fundamental building blocks, with the objective of providing a summary of
its large-scale structure. Despite its importance and widespread adoption,
there is a noticeable gap between what is considered the state-of-the-art and
the methods that are actually used in practice in a variety of fields. Here we
attempt to address this discrepancy by dividing existing methods according to
whether they have a &quot;descriptive&quot; or an &quot;inferential&quot; goal. While descriptive
methods find patterns in networks based on intuitive notions of community
structure, inferential methods articulate a precise generative model, and
attempt to fit it to data. In this way, they are able to provide insights into
the mechanisms of network formation, and separate structure from randomness in
a manner supported by statistical evidence. We review how employing descriptive
methods with inferential aims is riddled with pitfalls and misleading answers,
and thus should be in general avoided. We argue that inferential methods are
more typically aligned with clearer scientific questions, yield more robust
results, and should be in many cases preferred. We attempt to dispel some myths
and half-truths often believed when community detection is employed in
practice, in an effort to improve both the use of such methods as well as the
interpretation of their results.</span>

                    <span>The literature on robustness towards common corruptions shows no consensus on
whether adversarial training can improve the performance in this setting.
First, we show that, when used with an appropriately selected perturbation
radius, $\ell_p$ adversarial training can serve as a strong baseline against
common corruptions improving both accuracy and calibration. Then we explain why
adversarial training performs better than data augmentation with simple
Gaussian noise which has been observed to be a meaningful baseline on common
corruptions. Related to this, we identify the $\sigma$-overfitting phenomenon
when Gaussian augmentation overfits to a particular standard deviation used for
training which has a significant detrimental effect on common corruption
accuracy. We discuss how to alleviate this problem and then how to further
enhance $\ell_p$ adversarial training by introducing an efficient relaxation of
adversarial training with learned perceptual image patch similarity as the
distance metric. Through experiments on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet-100, we show that
our approach does not only improve the $\ell_p$ adversarial training baseline
but also has cumulative gains with data augmentation methods such as AugMix,
DeepAugment, ANT, and SIN, leading to state-of-the-art performance on common
corruptions.

                    <span>The effect of bias on hypothesis formation is characterized for an automated
data-driven projection pursuit neural network to extract and select features
for binary classification of data streams. This intelligent exploratory process
partitions a complete vector state space into disjoint subspaces to create
working hypotheses quantified by similarities and differences observed between
two groups of labeled data streams. Data streams are typically time sequenced,
and may exhibit complex spatio-temporal patterns. For example, given atomic
trajectories from molecular dynamics simulation, the machine&#x27;s task is to
quantify dynamical mechanisms that promote function by comparing protein
mutants, some known to function while others are nonfunctional. Utilizing
synthetic two-dimensional molecules that mimic the dynamics of functional and
nonfunctional proteins, biases are identified and controlled in both the
machine learning model and selected training data under different contexts. The
refinement of a working hypothesis converges to a statistically robust
multivariate perception of the data based on a context-dependent perspective.
Including diverse perspectives during data exploration enhances
interpretability of the multivariate characterization of similarities and
differences.</span>

Such approaches cannot scale to a wide range of items in the wild. BANMo is a technique that does not need a specialized sensor or a pre-defined template form. In a differentiable rendering framework, BANMo generates high-fidelity, articulated 3D models (including state and animatable skinning weights) from a large number of monocular casual films. While the usage of several films increases coverage of camera perspectives and object articulations, it introduces significant issues in establishing correlation across scenes with diverse backdrops, lighting conditions, etc. Continue Reading

                    <span>If there is a training data which consists of pair of image and corresponding textual explanation of that image. How to represent this Semantic knowledge between image and corresponding textual meaning in AI model. So that we don&#x27;t need much of training data, if I can infuse that knowledge between image and text pair. Idea is to infuse this knowledge and then at inference time, if such image appears then perform action. Ex- If there is a image and respective meaning is &#x27;open the door&#x27;, then if robot sees that image at inference it will open the door. I am thinking of NLP based model to infuse this knowledge, but not sure how BERT like model can be employed in this situation.
 Is there existing SOTA which addresses this kind of issues?

                    <span>Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have been one of the main hypes of recent years. Based on the famous generator-discriminator mechanism, their very simple functioning has driven the research to continuously improve the former architecture. The peak in image generation has been reached by StyleGANs, which can produce astonishingly realistic and high-quality images, able to fool even humans. 
 While the generation of new samples has achieved excellent results in the 2D domain, 3D GANs are still highly inefficient. If the exact mechanism of 2D GANs is applied in the 3D environment, the computational effort is too high since 3D data is tough to manipulate for current GPUs. For this reason, the research has focused on how to construct geometry-aware GANs that can infer the underline 3D property using solely 2D images. But, in this case, the approximations are usually not 3D consistent. Continue Reading The Paper Summary

                    <span>Imagine 10 cameras, running 24/7 at 30 FPS - that&#x27;s 27 million frames generated in a single day. Knowing what&#x27;s in that data or finding the 1% of things that are actually interesting is hard. I genuinely think there&#x27;s way too little attention put forth to how people should use their raw data effectively even though so many people choose to store petabytes of it, just in case.
 I wrote a little article about taking raw video and turning that into an actionable computer vision model. Would love to have a technical discussion about this so comment away :)

                    <span>Hello all,
 I&#x27;m currently working on a project where I&#x27;m trying to perform key information extraction (KIE) and classification on rental property operating statements. My plan is to pre-train a model on a similar dataset (e.g. [IBM FinTabNet](https://developer.ibm.com/exchanges/data/all/fintabnet/), etc.) and then fine-tune on a custom dataset I&#x27;m creating. My task is to:
  
Identify the key:value pairs associated with each line item for each period in the statement. So for example, for the first line item, we&#x27;d have a 3-tuple of (&#x27;Rent income&#x27;, &#x27;Nov 2020&#x27;, 21,428.03)
 Identify the key:value pairs associated with the total for each line item in the statement. So for example, for the first line item, we&#x27;d have a 3-tuple of (&#x27;Rent income&#x27;, &#x27;Total&#x27;, 322,872.36)

                    <span>Sparsest cut, and its close variant &quot;balanced cut&quot;, have been studied for ages in the computer science theory community, and there are algorithms to compute this which run fast. Sparsest cut is often billed as a &quot;graph clustering&quot; algorithm. 
 Sparsest cut gives rise to an obvious data clustering algorithm: build a graph on your data (like kNN or threshold graph), and run sparsest cut to get a 2-way partition. To do a k-way partition, you could recursively do this. From what I know, sparsest cut intuition is one thing that guided the creation of spectral clustering, a widely used clustering method. 
 HHas anyone tried implementing this in practice? If so, how does it do on data? If not, why not? I have searched extensively on Google for any implementations of this sparsest-cut style clustering, but I haven&#x27;t found any. Given that sparsest cut is one of the most well-studied problems in computer theory, I was surprised that no implementation of this clustering method exists.

 Are model extraction attacks a problem here at all? How does one protect their IP? I heard of people watermarking their models, but I am not sure how such techniques in their current form would fare in court.

                    <span>Hi all,
 I&#x27;m using a Yolov5 model to make inferences and noticed that it was faster at inferring 320x320 images (~0.25s/image) compared to 288x288 images (~0.45s/image). When I disabled test time augmentation, the gap closed, and both image sizes are inferred at ~0.084s/image. Any ideas why augmenting a smaller image size is slower than augmenting a faster image size?

 Hey r/ML, some of you might have heard about MDLI – short for Machine &amp; Deep Learning Israel. It&#x27;s an independent Israeli community (over 25K members) for professionals in data science and ML, and they are having a conference for everyone (in English), in just 14 days.
 You can register here https://machinelearning.co.il/mdli-ops-2022/
 I know that sometimes these free events tend to feel like commercials, but you should really check out the agenda. Some of the talks are going to be by ML teams at companies like AppsFlyer and BigPanda, explaining how they built their internal stacks and ML systems.
 There&#x27;s also a super interesting talk by the NVIDIA team, where they will talk about building supercomputers to train ML models on them. This one seems crazy awesome to me.
 It&#x27;s also a good opportunity to listen to offerings by some cool ML startups, which might give you a better understanding of how they compare, and what you actually care about when choosing MLOps tools.
 The organizers will probably be here in the comments if you have any questions, but in my opinion, every event this community organizes is really awesome, and I get to learn a lot, so I really recommend this.

I’ve been to traditional data science focused one, such as the Anaconda one. Though I wanted to see if any existed that were more closely connected to deployment.

                    <span>Hey everyone!
 I wanted to share with you an open-source tool we&#x27;ve been building for a while. Deepchecks is an open-source tool for validating &amp; testing models and data efficiently:
 https://github.com/deepchecks/deepchecks
 Deepchecks is a python package, implementing validations and tests needed in order to trust an ML pipeline. It contains many built-in checks, such as verifying the data integrity, inspecting its distributions, validating data splits, evaluating your model, and comparing between different models.
 In addition, it contains test suites, similar to the test suites in software programs, that can accompany you through all building blocks of the ML pipeline development. Each test suite contains checks necessary for the specific part in the pipeline.
 The suite result looks something like this:
 ​
 Suite result
 The suites and checks have a simple syntax and are highly customizable.
 If you want to jump right in, you can try it out in the quick start notebook:
 https://docs.deepchecks.com/en/stable/examples/guides/quickstart_in_5_minutes.html 
 What do you think? I’ll be happy to hear your thoughts and feedback.

                    <span>I have tried using a few pre-loaded architectures in Tensorflow including tf.keras.applications.efficientnet.EfficientNetB3
 and tf.keras.applications.MobileNetV3Large
 . I am working on medical images so I am not any pretrained ImageNet weights. I manage to reach a decent accuracy during the training epoch (eg 75%), but my validation accuracy doesn&#x27;t cross random performance (eg 3%). Upon closer inspection I have identified the cause as being the batch normalization layers - If I run the evaluation batches w/ training&#x3D;True
 on the BatchNorm layers, I am able to reproduce the training set accuracy. I have tried playing with the momentum parameter and changing it from its default value of .999 to .75 or even .5 but with no effect.
 My question is what may be causing this and how can I fix it? 
 On a larger note, do most people find that they can use pre-loaded architectures out-of-the-box or are there various parameters that they need to modify to get it to work properly?

                    <span>I have made rudimentary ANN before but keep looking for ways to push my boundaries. I like AI and flight sims so why not an AI that helps me flight sim. :)
 I&#x27;m thinking of an ANN assistant (eg co-pilot) that learns to do key actions during flight.
 Inputs:
  
On ground (Boolean)
 
Altitude (numerical - normalised)
 
Pitch (nose up/down/level)
 
 Outputs:
  
Gear (up/down)
 Autopilot (on/off)
 Flaps (up/down)
 Lights (on/off)
  
So, given the state of the aircraft at any given point, the ANN can manipulate (or recommend) the configuration of the aircraft and lighten the pilot work load (remembering this is a fun exercise).
 Assume my ANN can monitor and manipulate the flight sim (it has an interface to do this), is an ANN with appropriate weights and nodes a good fit (after training)?
 Should I be looking at Q-Table or something else?

 My question is, do i need to turn each frame into an image? To then be turned into a video in order to feed it into the 3dCNN? If so, how can i optimize this? 1 action has several frames in the same csv file, and I have several files. 
 Or can i just use temperature data in csv straight away? (Each file contains one action with several frames worth of temp data)
 Any help /links/ examples are greatly appreciated.

                    <span>Hi all,
 I implemented PPO using PyTorch here. As is suggested, I was trying it on very simple environment (CartPole-v1).
 My PPO doesn&#x27;t seem to be very impressive. The reward seems to saturate somewhere around 25, while the best it can go is around 190s. Here is benchmark of all my experiments. There exist various implementations with various set of hyperparameters, and other improvement choices (Advantage using GAE, Clip critic loss, and so on). I have tried various mix of them, but sadly nothing seems to improve it.
 The various resources I have referred are:

 Can you help me getting it trained on this simple environment.I have implemented it in a way that it should be easy to run and understand.

                    <span>Hello everybody!
 One implementation detail of PPO is to normalize the advantage estimates. These are usually normalized using the mean and std so that the mean is 0 and the std is 1. Now, I came across 3 different implementations that apply the normalization to different amounts of data. More precisely:
  
Normalizing advantages across single episodes (kamarl)
 Normalizing advantages across single mini batches (neroRL)
 Normalizing advantages across the entire batch (SpinningUp)
  
Do you guys think that this detail has a higher impact?
 My first intuition is that the more data is used for normalization, the smoother the normalized advantages are. So when normalizing across single episodes, this could lead to a high variance causing harmfully large parameter updates, whereas the smooth normalization could hinder learning.

                    <span>Hi everyone - I am a data scientist who works a lot on causal inference problems. In particular, I build individual treatment effect (AKA Conditional Average Treatment Effects AKA Uplift) models to estimate the causal effect of some potential treatment(s) on an outcome of interest for an individual for the express purpose of giving the optimal &quot;treatment&quot; to a given individual. &quot;Optimal&quot; usually means the treatment that is estimated to cause the largest positive effect on the outcome. A typical example is optimizing marketing touches for individual customers: we have several &quot;treatments&quot; we can apply to a customer at a given time, such as targeting them for an online ad campaign, sending a push notification through our app, sending a marketing email, etc. and we want to make sure we are pu…</span>

                    <span>In the hospital setting, a small percentage of recurrent frequent patients
contribute to a disproportional amount of healthcare resource usage. Moreover,
in many of these cases, patient outcomes can be greatly improved by reducing
reoccurring visits, especially when they are associated with substance abuse,
mental health, and medical factors that could be improved by social-behavioral
interventions, outpatient or preventative care. Additionally, health care costs
can be reduced significantly with fewer preventable recurrent visits.

To address this, we developed a computationally efficient and interpretable
framework that both identifies recurrent patients with high utilization and
determines which comorbidities contribute most to their recurrent visits.
Specifically, we present a novel algorithm, called the minimum similarity
association rules (MSAR), balancing confidence-support trade-off, to determine
the conditions most associated with reoccurring Emergency department (ED) and
inpatient visits. We validate MSAR on a large Electric Health Record (EHR)
dataset.</span>

                    <span>Fine-grained IP geolocation systems often rely on some linear delay-distance
rules. They are not easy to generalize in network environments where the
delay-distance relationship is non-linear. Recently, researchers begin to pay
attention to learning-based IP geolocation systems. These data-driven
algorithms leverage multi-layer perceptron (MLP) to model non-linear
relationships. However, MLP is not so suitable for modeling computer networks
because networks are fundamentally graph-typed data. MLP-based IP geolocation
systems only treat IP addresses as isolated data instances, forgoing the
connection information between IP addresses. This would lead to sub-optimal
representations and limit the geolocation performance.

Graph convolutional network (GCN) is an emerging deep learning method for
graph-typed data presentation. In this work, we research how to model computer
networks for fine-grained IP geolocation with GCN. First, we formulate the IP
geolocation task as an attributed graph node regression problem. Then, a
GCN-based IP geolocation system named GCN-Geo is proposed to predict the
location of each IP address. GCN-Geo consists of a preprocessor, an encoder,
graph convolutional (GC) layers and a decoder. The preprocessor and the encoder
transform raw measurement data into the initial graph embeddings. GC layers
refine the initial graph node embeddings by explicitly modeling the connection
information between IP addresses. The proposed decoder can relieve the
converging problem of GCN-Geo by considering some prior knowledge about target
IP addresses. Finally, the experimental results in three real-world datasets
show that: GCN-Geo clearly outperforms the state-of-art rule-based and
learning-based baselines on all three datasets w.r.t. average, median and max
error distances. This work verifies the potential of GCN in fine-grained IP
geolocation.</span>

                    <span>Logs are widely used to record runtime information of software systems, such
as the timestamp and the importance of an event, the unique ID of the source of
the log, and a part of the state of a task&#x27;s execution. The rich information of
logs enables system developers (and operators) to monitor the runtime behaviors
of their systems and further track down system problems and perform analysis on
log data in production settings. However, the prior research on utilizing logs
is scattered and that limits the ability of new researchers in this field to
quickly get to the speed and hampers currently active researchers to advance
this field further. Therefore, this paper surveys and provides a systematic
literature review and mapping of the contemporary logging practices and log
statements&#x27; mining and monitoring techniques and their applications such as in
system failure detection and diagnosis. We study a large number of conference
and journal papers that appeared on top-level peer-reviewed venues.
Additionally, we draw high-level trends of ongoing research and categorize
publications into subdivisions. In the end, and based on our holistic
observations during this survey, we provide a set of challenges and
opportunities that will lead the researchers in academia and industry in moving

                    <span>Wrist fractures are common cases in hospitals, particularly in emergency
services. Physicians need images from various medical devices, and patients
medical history and physical examination to diagnose these fractures correctly
and apply proper treatment. This study aims to perform fracture detection using
deep learning on wrist Xray images to assist physicians not specialized in the
field, working in emergency services in particular, in diagnosis of fractures.
For this purpose, 20 different detection procedures were performed using deep
learning based object detection models on dataset of wrist Xray images obtained
from Gazi University Hospital. DCN, Dynamic R_CNN, Faster R_CNN, FSAF, Libra
R_CNN, PAA, RetinaNet, RegNet and SABL deep learning based object detection
models with various backbones were used herein. To further improve detection
procedures in the study, 5 different ensemble models were developed, which were
later used to reform an ensemble model to develop a detection model unique to

                    <span>Outsourced computation for neural networks allows users access to state of
the art models without needing to invest in specialized hardware and know-how.
The problem is that the users lose control over potentially privacy sensitive
data. With homomorphic encryption (HE) computation can be performed on
encrypted data without revealing its content. In this systematization of
knowledge, we take an in-depth look at approaches that combine neural networks
with HE for privacy preservation. We categorize the changes to neural network
models and architectures to make them computable over HE and how these changes
impact performance. We find numerous challenges to HE based privacy-preserving
deep learning such as computational overhead, usability, and limitations posed
by the encryption schemes.</span>

                    <span>Class Incremental Learning (CIL) aims at learning a multi-class classifier in
a phase-by-phase manner, in which only data of a subset of the classes are
provided at each phase. Previous works mainly focus on mitigating forgetting in
phases after the initial one. However, we find that improving CIL at its
initial phase is also a promising direction. Specifically, we experimentally
show that directly encouraging CIL Learner at the initial phase to output
similar representations as the model jointly trained on all classes can greatly
boost the CIL performance. Motivated by this, we study the difference between a
na\&quot;ively-trained initial-phase model and the oracle model. Specifically, since
one major difference between these two models is the number of training
classes, we investigate how such difference affects the model representations.
We find that, with fewer training classes, the data representations of each
class lie in a long and narrow region; with more training classes, the
representations of each class scatter more uniformly. Inspired by this
observation, we propose Class-wise Decorrelation (CwD) that effectively
regularizes representations of each class to scatter more uniformly, thus
mimicking the model jointly trained with all classes (i.e., the oracle model).
Our CwD is simple to implement and easy to plug into existing methods.
Extensive experiments on various benchmark datasets show that CwD consistently
and significantly improves the performance of existing state-of-the-art methods
by around 1\% to 3\%. Code will be released.</span>

                    <span>The Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture is showing promising results in
improving parameter sharing in multi-task learning (MTL) and in scaling
high-capacity neural networks. State-of-the-art MoE models use a trainable
sparse gate to select a subset of the experts for each input example. While
conceptually appealing, existing sparse gates, such as Top-k, are not smooth.
The lack of smoothness can lead to convergence and statistical performance
issues when training with gradient-based methods. In this paper, we develop
DSelect-k: a continuously differentiable and sparse gate for MoE, based on a
novel binary encoding formulation. The gate can be trained using first-order
methods, such as stochastic gradient descent, and offers explicit control over
the number of experts to select. We demonstrate the effectiveness of DSelect-k
on both synthetic and real MTL datasets with up to $128$ tasks. Our experiments
indicate that DSelect-k can achieve statistically significant improvements in
prediction and expert selection over popular MoE gates. Notably, on a
real-world, large-scale recommender system, DSelect-k achieves over $22\%$
improvement in predictive performance compared to Top-k. We provide an
open-source implementation of DSelect-k.</span>

                    <span>Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) is a fundamental structure in deep learning.
Recently, some works study the training process of over-parameterized neural
networks, and show that over-parameterized networks can learn functions in some
notable concept classes with a provable generalization error bound. In this
paper, we analyze the training and generalization for RNNs with random
initialization, and provide the following improvements over recent works:

1) For a RNN with input sequence $x&#x3D;(X_1,X_2,...,X_L)$, previous works study
to learn functions that are summation of $f(\beta^T_lX_l)$ and require
normalized conditions that $||X_l||\leq\epsilon$ with some very small
$\epsilon$ depending on the complexity of $f$. In this paper, using detailed
analysis about the neural tangent kernel matrix, we prove a generalization
error bound to learn such functions without normalized conditions and show that
some notable concept classes are learnable with the numbers of iterations and
samples scaling almost-polynomially in the input length $L$.

2) Moreover, we prove a novel result to learn N-variables functions of input
sequence with the form $f(\beta^T[X_{l_1},...,X_{l_N}])$, which do not belong
to the &quot;additive&quot; concept class, i,e., the summation of function $f(X_l)$. And
we show that when either $N$ or $l_0&#x3D;\max(l_1,..,l_N)-\min(l_1,..,l_N)$ is
small, $f(\beta^T[X_{l_1},...,X_{l_N}])$ will be learnable with the number
iterations and samples scaling almost-polynomially in the input length $L$.</span>

                    <span>In Federated Learning, a common approach for aggregating local models across
clients is periodic averaging of the full model parameters. It is, however,
known that different layers of neural networks can have a different degree of
model discrepancy across the clients. The conventional full aggregation scheme
does not consider such a difference and synchronizes the whole model parameters
at once, resulting in inefficient network bandwidth consumption. Aggregating
the parameters that are similar across the clients does not make meaningful
training progress while increasing the communication cost. We propose FedLAMA,
a layer-wise model aggregation scheme for scalable Federated Learning. FedLAMA
adaptively adjusts the aggregation interval in a layer-wise manner, jointly
considering the model discrepancy and the communication cost. The layer-wise
aggregation method enables to finely control the aggregation interval to relax
the aggregation frequency without a significant impact on the model accuracy.
Our empirical study shows that FedLAMA reduces the communication cost by up to
60% for IID data and 70% for non-IID data while achieving a comparable accuracy
to FedAvg.</span>

                    <span>Shared autonomy refers to approaches for enabling an autonomous agent to
collaborate with a human with the aim of improving human performance. However,
besides improving performance, it may often also be beneficial that the agent
concurrently accounts for preserving the user&#x27;s experience or satisfaction of
collaboration. In order to address this additional goal, we examine approaches
for improving the user experience by constraining the number of interventions
by the autonomous agent. We propose two model-free reinforcement learning
methods that can account for both hard and soft constraints on the number of
interventions. We show that not only does our method outperform the existing
baseline, but also eliminates the need to manually tune a black-box
hyperparameter for controlling the level of assistance. We also provide an
in-depth analysis of intervention scenarios in order to further illuminate
system understanding.</span>

                    <span>Federated learning enables multiple users to build a joint model by sharing
their model updates (gradients), while their raw data remains local on their
devices. In contrast to the common belief that this provides privacy benefits,
we here add to the very recent results on privacy risks when sharing gradients.
Specifically, we investigate Label Leakage from Gradients (LLG), a novel attack
to extract the labels of the users&#x27; training data from their shared gradients.
The attack exploits the direction and magnitude of gradients to determine the
presence or absence of any label. LLG is simple yet effective, capable of
leaking potential sensitive information represented by labels, and scales well
to arbitrary batch sizes and multiple classes. We mathematically and
empirically demonstrate the validity of the attack under different settings.
Moreover, empirical results show that LLG successfully extracts labels with
high accuracy at the early stages of model training. We also discuss different
defense mechanisms against such leakage. Our findings suggest that gradient
compression is a practical technique to mitigate the attack.</span>

                    <span>We study reinforcement learning (RL) with linear function approximation under
the adaptivity constraint. We consider two popular limited adaptivity models:
the batch learning model and the rare policy switch model, and propose two
efficient online RL algorithms for episodic linear Markov decision processes,
where the transition probability and the reward function can be represented as
a linear function of some known feature mapping. In specific, for the batch
learning model, our proposed LSVI-UCB-Batch algorithm achieves an $\tilde
O(\sqrt{d^3H^3T} + dHT/B)$ regret, where $d$ is the dimension of the feature
mapping, $H$ is the episode length, $T$ is the number of interactions and $B$
is the number of batches. Our result suggests that it suffices to use only
$\sqrt{T/dH}$ batches to obtain $\tilde O(\sqrt{d^3H^3T})$ regret. For the rare
policy switch model, our proposed LSVI-UCB-RareSwitch algorithm enjoys an
$\tilde O(\sqrt{d^3H^3T[1+T/(dH)]^{dH/B}})$ regret, which implies that $dH\log
T$ policy switches suffice to obtain the $\tilde O(\sqrt{d^3H^3T})$ regret. Our
algorithms achieve the same regret as the LSVI-UCB algorithm (Jin et al.,
2019), yet with a substantially smaller amount of adaptivity. We also establish
a lower bound for the batch learning model, which suggests that the dependency
on $B$ in our regret bound is tight.</span>

                    <span>Deep neural networks (DNNs) have shown superior performances on various
multimodal learning problems. However, it often requires huge efforts to adapt
DNNs to individual multimodal tasks by manually engineering unimodal features
and designing multimodal feature fusion strategies. This paper proposes Bilevel
Multimodal Neural Architecture Search (BM-NAS) framework, which makes the
architecture of multimodal fusion models fully searchable via a bilevel
searching scheme. At the upper level, BM-NAS selects the inter/intra-modal
feature pairs from the pretrained unimodal backbones. At the lower level,
BM-NAS learns the fusion strategy for each feature pair, which is a combination
of predefined primitive operations. The primitive operations are elaborately
designed and they can be flexibly combined to accommodate various effective
feature fusion modules such as multi-head attention (Transformer) and Attention
on Attention (AoA). Experimental results on three multimodal tasks demonstrate
the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed BM-NAS framework. BM-NAS
achieves competitive performances with much less search time and fewer model
parameters in comparison with the existing generalized multimodal NAS methods.</span>

                    <span>Optimizing nonconvex (NCVX) problems, especially nonsmooth and constrained
ones, is an essential part of machine learning. However, it can be hard to
reliably solve such problems without optimization expertise. Existing
general-purpose NCVX optimization packages are powerful but typically cannot
handle nonsmoothness. GRANSO is among the first optimization solvers targeting
general nonsmooth NCVX problems with nonsmooth constraints, but, as it is
implemented in MATLAB and requires the user to provide analytical gradients,
GRANSO is often not a convenient choice in machine learning (especially deep
learning) applications. To greatly lower the technical barrier, we introduce a
new software package called NCVX, whose initial release contains the solver
PyGRANSO, a PyTorch-enabled port of GRANSO incorporating auto-differentiation,
GPU acceleration, tensor input, and support for new QP solvers. NCVX is built
on freely available and widely used open-source frameworks, and as a highlight,
can solve general constrained deep learning problems, the first of its kind.
NCVX is available at https://ncvx.org, with detailed documentation and numerous
examples from machine learning and other fields.</span>

                    <span>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have shown advantages in various graph-based
applications. Most existing GNNs assume strong homophily of graph structure and
apply permutation-invariant local aggregation of neighbors to learn a
representation for each node. However, they fail to generalize to heterophilic
graphs, where most neighboring nodes have different labels or features, and the
relevant nodes are distant. Few recent studies attempt to address this problem
by combining multiple hops of hidden representations of central nodes (i.e.,
multi-hop-based approaches) or sorting the neighboring nodes based on attention
scores (i.e., ranking-based approaches). As a result, these approaches have
some apparent limitations. On the one hand, multi-hop-based approaches do not
explicitly distinguish relevant nodes from a large number of multi-hop
neighborhoods, leading to a severe over-smoothing problem. On the other hand,
ranking-based models do not joint-optimize node ranking with end tasks and
result in sub-optimal solutions. In this work, we present Graph Pointer Neural
Networks (GPNN) to tackle the challenges mentioned above. We leverage a pointer
network to select the most relevant nodes from a large amount of multi-hop
neighborhoods, which constructs an ordered sequence according to the
relationship with the central node. 1D convolution is then applied to extract
high-level features from the node sequence. The pointer-network-based ranker in
GPNN is joint-optimized with other parts in an end-to-end manner. Extensive
experiments are conducted on six public node classification datasets with
heterophilic graphs. The results show that GPNN significantly improves the
classification performance of state-of-the-art methods. In addition, analyses
also reveal the privilege of the proposed GPNN in filtering out irrelevant
neighbors and reducing over-smoothing.</span>

                    <span>The study of generalisation in deep Reinforcement Learning (RL) aims to
produce RL algorithms whose policies generalise well to novel unseen situations
at deployment time, avoiding overfitting to their training environments.
Tackling this is vital if we are to deploy reinforcement learning algorithms in
real world scenarios, where the environment will be diverse, dynamic and
unpredictable. This survey is an overview of this nascent field. We provide a
unifying formalism and terminology for discussing different generalisation
problems, building upon previous works. We go on to categorise existing
benchmarks for generalisation, as well as current methods for tackling the
generalisation problem. Finally, we provide a critical discussion of the
current state of the field, including recommendations for future work. Among
other conclusions, we argue that taking a purely procedural content generation
approach to benchmark design is not conducive to progress in generalisation, we
suggest fast online adaptation and tackling RL-specific problems as some areas
for future work on methods for generalisation, and we recommend building
benchmarks in underexplored problem settings such as offline RL generalisation
and reward-function variation.</span>

                    <span>Quantum computers hold unprecedented potentials for machine learning
applications. Here, we prove that physical quantum circuits are PAC (probably
approximately correct) learnable on a quantum computer via empirical risk
minimization: to learn a parametric quantum circuit with at most $n^c$ gates
and each gate acting on a constant number of qubits, the sample complexity is
bounded by $\tilde{O}(n^{c+1})$. In particular, we explicitly construct a
family of variational quantum circuits with $O(n^{c+1})$ elementary gates
arranged in a fixed pattern, which can represent all physical quantum circuits
consisting of at most $n^c$ elementary gates. Our results provide a valuable
guide for quantum machine learning in both theory and practice.</span>

                    <span>Bayesian Optimization algorithm has become a promising approach for nonlinear
global optimization problems and many machine learning applications. Over the
past few years, improvements and enhancements have been brought forward and
they have shown some promising results in solving the complex dynamic problems,
systems of ordinary differential equations where the objective functions are
computationally expensive to evaluate. Besides, the straightforward
implementation of the Bayesian Optimization algorithm performs well merely for
optimization problems with 10-20 dimensions. The study presented in this paper
proposes a new high dimensional Bayesian Optimization algorithm combining
Recurrent neural networks, which is expected to predict the optimal solution
for the global optimization problems with high dimensional or time series
decision models. The proposed RNN-BO algorithm can solve the optimal control
problems in the lower dimension space and then learn from the historical data
using the recurrent neural network to learn the historical optimal solution
data and predict the optimal control strategy for any new initial system value
setting. In addition, accurately and quickly providing the optimal control
strategy is essential to effectively and efficiently control the epidemic
spread while minimizing the associated financial costs. Therefore, to verify
the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm, computational experiments are
carried out on a deterministic SEIR epidemic model and a stochastic SIS optimal
control model. Finally, we also discuss the impacts of different numbers of the
RNN layers and training epochs on the trade-off between solution quality and
related computational efforts.</span>

                    <span>Acute and chronic wounds with varying etiologies burden the healthcare
systems economically. The advanced wound care market is estimated to reach $22
billion by 2024. Wound care professionals provide proper diagnosis and
treatment with heavy reliance on images and image documentation. Segmentation
of wound boundaries in images is a key component of the care and diagnosis
protocol since it is important to estimate the area of the wound and provide
quantitative measurement for the treatment. Unfortunately, this process is very
time-consuming and requires a high level of expertise. Recently automatic wound
segmentation methods based on deep learning have shown promising performance
but require large datasets for training and it is unclear which methods perform
better. To address these issues, we propose the Foot Ulcer Segmentation
challenge (FUSeg) organized in conjunction with the 2021 International
Conference on Medical Image Computing and Computer Assisted Intervention
(MICCAI). We built a wound image dataset containing 1,210 foot ulcer images
collected over 2 years from 889 patients. It is pixel-wise annotated by wound
care experts and split into a training set with 1010 images and a testing set
with 200 images for evaluation. Teams around the world developed automated
methods to predict wound segmentations on the testing set of which annotations
were kept private. The predictions were evaluated and ranked based on the
average Dice coefficient. The FUSeg challenge remains an open challenge as a
benchmark for wound segmentation after the conference.</span>

                    <span>This paper proposes an information-theoretic loss for learning deep neural
networks. We propose a loss function based on the Information Bottleneck
principle and a max-margin loss with an aim to increase the class separability
in the embedded space. While deep neural network models have excelled in
supervised learning tasks with large-scale labeled data available, they are
prone to practical issues in testing samples outside of classes shown in
training, e.g., anomaly detection and out-of-distribution detection. In such
tasks, it is not sufficient to merely discriminate between known classes. Our
intuition is to represent the known classes in compact and separated embedded
regions in order to decrease the possibility of known and unseen classes
largely overlapping in the embedded space. We show that the IB-based loss
function reflects the inter-class distances as well as the compactness within
classes, thus will extend the extending models of the existing deep data
description models. Our empirical study shows that the proposed model improves
the segmentation of normal classes in the deep feature space which contributes
to identifying the out-of-distribution samples.</span>

                    <span>Although groups of strongly correlated antivirus engines are known to exist,
at present there is limited understanding of how or why these correlations came
to be. Using a corpus of 25 million VirusTotal reports representing over a
decade of antivirus scan data, we challenge prevailing wisdom that these
correlations primarily originate from &quot;first-order&quot; interactions such as
antivirus vendors copying the labels of leading vendors. We introduce the
Temporal Rank-1 Similarity Matrix decomposition (R1SM-T) in order to
investigate the origins of these correlations and to model how consensus
amongst antivirus engines changes over time. We reveal that first-order
interactions do not explain as much behavior in antivirus correlation as
previously thought, and that the relationships between antivirus engines are
highly volatile. We make recommendations on items in need of future study and
consideration based on our findings.</span>

                    <span>Objective: With the rapid rise of wearable sleep monitoring devices with
non-conventional electrode configurations, there is a need for automated
algorithms that can perform sleep staging on configurations with small amounts
of labeled data. Transfer learning has the ability to adapt neural network
weights from a source modality (e.g. standard electrode configuration) to a new
target modality (e.g. non-conventional electrode configuration). Methods: We
propose feature matching, a new transfer learning strategy as an alternative to
the commonly used finetuning approach. This method consists of training a model
with larger amounts of data from the source modality and few paired samples of
source and target modality. For those paired samples, the model extracts
features of the target modality, matching these to the features from the
corresponding samples of the source modality. Results: We compare feature
matching to finetuning for three different target domains, with two different
neural network architectures, and with varying amounts of training data.
Particularly on small cohorts (i.e. 2 - 5 labeled recordings in the
non-conventional recording setting), feature matching systematically
outperforms finetuning with mean relative differences in accuracy ranging from
0.4% to 4.7% for the different scenarios and datasets. Conclusion: Our findings
suggest that feature matching outperforms finetuning as a transfer learning
approach, especially in very low data regimes. Significance: As such, we
conclude that feature matching is a promising new method for wearable sleep
staging with novel devices.</span>

                    <span>Lung cancer has been one of the most prevalent disease in recent years.
According to the research of this field, more than 200,000 cases are identified
each year in the US. Uncontrolled multiplication and growth of the lung cells
result in malignant tumour formation. Recently, deep learning algorithms,
especially Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), have become a superior way to
automatically diagnose disease. The purpose of this article is to review
different models that lead to different accuracy and sensitivity in the
diagnosis of early-stage lung cancer and to help physicians and researchers in
this field. The main purpose of this work is to identify the challenges that
exist in lung cancer based on deep learning. The survey is systematically
written that combines regular mapping and literature review to review 32
conference and journal articles in the field from 2016 to 2021. After analysing
and reviewing the articles, the questions raised in the articles are being
answered. This research is superior to other review articles in this field due
to the complete review of relevant articles and systematic write up.</span>

different data distributions can exhibit distinct generalization behaviors. In
this paper, we analyze the generalization of models trained by noisy iterative
algorithms. We derive distribution-dependent generalization bounds by
connecting noisy iterative algorithms to additive noise channels found in
communication and information theory. Our generalization bounds shed light on
several applications, including differentially private stochastic gradient
descent (DP-SGD), federated learning, and stochastic gradient Langevin dynamics
(SGLD). We demonstrate our bounds through numerical experiments, showing that
they can help understand recent empirical observations of the generalization
phenomena of neural networks.</span>

                    <span>Meta-learning, or learning-to-learn, seeks to design algorithms that can
utilize previous experience to rapidly learn new skills or adapt to new
environments. Representation learning -- a key tool for performing
meta-learning -- learns a data representation that can transfer knowledge
across multiple tasks, which is essential in regimes where data is scarce.
Despite a recent surge of interest in the practice of meta-learning, the
theoretical underpinnings of meta-learning algorithms are lacking, especially
in the context of learning transferable representations. In this paper, we
focus on the problem of multi-task linear regression -- in which multiple
linear regression models share a common, low-dimensional linear representation.
Here, we provide provably fast, sample-efficient algorithms to address the dual
challenges of (1) learning a common set of features from multiple, related
tasks, and (2) transferring this knowledge to new, unseen tasks. Both are
central to the general problem of meta-learning. Finally, we complement these
results by providing information-theoretic lower bounds on the sample
complexity of learning these linear features.</span>

                    <span>The widely applied density peak clustering (DPC) algorithm makes an intuitive
cluster formation assumption that cluster centers are often surrounded by data
points with lower local density and far away from other data points with higher
local density. However, this assumption suffers from one limitation that it is
often problematic when identifying clusters with lower density because they
might be easily merged into other clusters with higher density. As a result,
DPC may not be able to identify clusters with variational density. To address
this issue, we propose a variational density peak clustering (VDPC) algorithm,
which is designed to systematically and autonomously perform the clustering
task on datasets with various types of density distributions. Specifically, we
first propose a novel method to identify the representatives among all data
points and construct initial clusters based on the identified representatives
for further analysis of the clusters&#x27; property. Furthermore, we divide all data
points into different levels according to their local density and propose a
unified clustering framework by combining the advantages of both DPC and
DBSCAN. Thus, all the identified initial clusters spreading across different
density levels are systematically processed to form the final clusters. To
evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed VDPC algorithm, we conduct extensive
experiments using 20 datasets including eight synthetic, six real-world and six
image datasets. The experimental results show that VDPC outperforms two
classical algorithms (i.e., DPC and DBSCAN) and four state-of-the-art extended
DPC algorithms.</span>

                    <span>It has become critical for deep learning algorithms to quantify their output
uncertainties to satisfy reliability constraints and provide accurate results.
Uncertainty estimation for regression has received less attention than
classification due to the more straightforward standardized output of the
latter class of tasks and their high importance. However, regression problems
are encountered in a wide range of applications in computer vision. We propose
SLURP, a generic approach for regression uncertainty estimation via a side
learner that exploits the output and the intermediate representations generated
by the main task model. We test SLURP on two critical regression tasks in
computer vision: monocular depth and optical flow estimation. In addition, we
conduct exhaustive benchmarks comprising transfer to different datasets and the
addition of aleatoric noise. The results show that our proposal is generic and
readily applicable to various regression problems and has a low computational
cost with respect to existing solutions.</span>

                    <span>In this paper, we revisit the constrained and stochastic continuous
submodular maximization in both offline and online settings. For each
$\gamma$-weakly DR-submodular function $f$, we use the factor-revealing
optimization equation to derive an optimal auxiliary function $F$, whose
stationary points provide a $(1-e^{-\gamma})$-approximation to the global
maximum value (denoted as $OPT$) of problem
$\max_{\boldsymbol{x}\in\mathcal{C}}f(\boldsymbol{x})$. Naturally, the
projected (mirror) gradient ascent relied on this non-oblivious function
achieves $(1-e^{-\gamma}-\epsilon^{2})OPT-\epsilon$ after $O(1/\epsilon^{2})$
iterations, beating the traditional
$(\frac{\gamma^{2}}{1+\gamma^{2}})$-approximation gradient ascent
\citep{hassani2017gradient} for submodular maximization. Similarly, based on
$F$, the classical Frank-Wolfe algorithm equipped with variance reduction
technique \citep{mokhtari2018conditional} also returns a solution with
objective value larger than $(1-e^{-\gamma}-\epsilon^{2})OPT-\epsilon$ after
$O(1/\epsilon^{3})$ iterations. In the online setting, we first consider the
adversarial delays for stochastic gradient feedback, under which we propose a
boosting online gradient algorithm with the same non-oblivious search,
achieving a regret of $\sqrt{D}$ (where $D$ is the sum of delays of gradient
feedback) against a $(1-e^{-\gamma})$-approximation to the best feasible
solution in hindsight. Finally, extensive numerical experiments demonstrate the
efficiency of our boosting methods.</span>

                    <span>This paper explores the feasibility of finding an optimal sub-model from a
vision transformer and introduces a pure vision transformer slimming (ViT-Slim)
framework that can search such a sub-structure from the original model
end-to-end across multiple dimensions, including the input tokens, MHSA and MLP
modules with state-of-the-art performance. Our method is based on a learnable
and unified l1 sparsity constraint with pre-defined factors to reflect the
global importance in the continuous searching space of different dimensions.
The searching process is highly efficient through a single-shot training
scheme. For instance, on DeiT-S, ViT-Slim only takes ~43 GPU hours for
searching process, and the searched structure is flexible with diverse
dimensionalities in different modules. Then, a budget threshold is employed
according to the requirements of accuracy-FLOPs trade-off on running devices,
and a re-training process is performed to obtain the final models. The
extensive experiments show that our ViT-Slim can compress up to 40% of
parameters and 40% FLOPs on various vision transformers while increasing the
accuracy by ~0.6% on ImageNet. We also demonstrate the advantage of our
searched models on several downstream datasets. Our source code will be

                    <span>As neural network classifiers are deployed in real-world applications, it is
crucial that their failures can be detected reliably. One practical solution is
to assign confidence scores to each prediction, then use these scores to filter
out possible misclassifications. However, existing confidence metrics are not
yet sufficiently reliable for this role. This paper presents a new framework
that produces a quantitative metric for detecting misclassification errors.
This framework, RED, builds an error detector on top of the base classifier and
estimates uncertainty of the detection scores using Gaussian Processes.
Experimental comparisons with other error detection methods on 125 UCI datasets
demonstrate that this approach is effective. Further implementations on two
probabilistic base classifiers and two large deep learning architecture in
vision tasks further confirm that the method is robust and scalable. Third, an
empirical analysis of RED with out-of-distribution and adversarial samples
shows that the method can be used not only to detect errors but also to
understand where they come from. RED can thereby be used to improve
trustworthiness of neural network classifiers more broadly in the future.</span>

                    <span>In this paper, we take a data-driven approach and apply machine learning to
the moment closure problem for radiative transfer equation in slab geometry.
Instead of learning the unclosed high order moment, we propose to directly
learn the gradient of the high order moment using neural networks. This new
approach is consistent with the exact closure we derive for the free streaming
limit and also provides a natural output normalization. A variety of benchmark
tests, including the variable scattering problem, the Gaussian source problem
with both periodic and reflecting boundaries, and the two-material problem,
show both good accuracy and generalizability of our machine learning closure
model.</span>

                    <span>Online reviews enable consumers to engage with companies and provide
important feedback. Due to the complexity of the high-dimensional text, these
reviews are often simplified as a single numerical score, e.g., ratings or
sentiment scores. This work empirically examines the causal effects of
user-generated online reviews on a granular level: we consider multiple
aspects, e.g., the Food and Service of a restaurant. Understanding consumers&#x27;
opinions toward different aspects can help evaluate business performance in
detail and strategize business operations effectively. Specifically, we aim to
answer interventional questions such as What will the restaurant popularity be
if the quality w.r.t. its aspect Service is increased by 10%? The defining
challenge of causal inference with observational data is the presence of
&quot;confounder&quot;, which might not be observed or measured, e.g., consumers&#x27;
preference to food type, rendering the estimated effects biased and
high-variance. To address this challenge, we have recourse to the multi-modal
proxies such as the consumer profile information and interactions between
consumers and businesses. We show how to effectively leverage the rich
information to identify and estimate causal effects of multiple aspects
embedded in online reviews. Empirical evaluations on synthetic and real-world
data corroborate the efficacy and shed light on the actionable insight of the
proposed approach.</span>

                    <span>Deep neural networks have a wide range of applications in solving various
real-world tasks and have achieved satisfactory results, in domains such as
computer vision, image classification, and natural language processing.
Meanwhile, the security and robustness of neural networks have become
imperative, as diverse researches have shown the vulnerable aspects of neural
networks. Case in point, in Natural language processing tasks, the neural
network may be fooled by an attentively modified text, which has a high
similarity to the original one. As per previous research, most of the studies
are focused on the image domain; Different from image adversarial attacks, the
text is represented in a discrete sequence, traditional image attack methods
are not applicable in the NLP field. In this paper, we propose a word-level NLP
sentiment classifier attack model, which includes a self-attention
mechanism-based word selection method and a greedy search algorithm for word
substitution. We experiment with our attack model by attacking GRU and 1D-CNN
victim models on IMDB datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that our model
achieves a higher attack success rate and more efficient than previous methods
due to the efficient word selection algorithms are employed and minimized the
word substitute number. Also, our model is transferable, which can be used in
the image domain with several modifications.</span>

performance degradation, and targeted attacks have been successful via
perturbations that involve control of the victim&#x27;s policy and rewards. We
introduce an insidious poisoning attack for reinforcement learning which causes
agent misbehavior only at specific target states - all while minimally
modifying a small fraction of training observations without assuming any
control over policy or reward. We accomplish this by adapting a recent
technique, gradient alignment, to reinforcement learning. We test our method

                    <span>Devising dynamic pricing policy with always valid online statistical learning
procedure is an important and as yet unresolved problem. Most existing dynamic
pricing policy, which focus on the faithfulness of adopted customer choice
models, exhibit a limited capability for adapting the online uncertainty of
learned statistical model during pricing process. In this paper, we propose a
novel approach for designing dynamic pricing policy based regularized online
statistical learning with theoretical guarantees. The new approach overcomes
the challenge of continuous monitoring of online Lasso procedure and possesses
several appealing properties. In particular, we make the decisive observation
that the always-validity of pricing decisions builds and thrives on the online
regularization scheme. Our proposed online regularization scheme equips the
proposed optimistic online regularized maximum likelihood pricing (OORMLP)
pricing policy with three major advantages: encode market noise knowledge into
pricing process optimism; empower online statistical learning with
always-validity over all decision points; envelop prediction error process with
time-uniform non-asymptotic oracle inequalities. This type of non-asymptotic
inference results allows us to design more sample-efficient and robust dynamic
pricing algorithms in practice. In theory, the proposed OORMLP algorithm
exploits the sparsity structure of high-dimensional models and secures a
logarithmic regret in a decision horizon. These theoretical advances are made
possible by proposing an optimistic online Lasso procedure that resolves
dynamic pricing problems at the process level, based on a novel use of
non-asymptotic martingale concentration. In experiments, we evaluate OORMLP in
different synthetic and real pricing problem settings, and demonstrate that
OORMLP advances the state-of-the-art methods.</span>

                    <span>Time series analysis is a widespread task in Natural Sciences, Social
Sciences, and Engineering. A fundamental problem is finding an expressive yet
efficient-to-compute representation of the input time series to use as a
starting point to perform arbitrary downstream tasks. In this paper, we build
upon recent works that use the Signature of a path as a feature map and
investigate a computationally efficient technique to approximate these features
based on linear random projections. We present several theoretical results to
justify our approach and empirically validate that our random projections can
effectively retrieve the underlying Signature of a path. We show the surprising
performance of the proposed random features on several tasks, including (1)
mapping the controls of stochastic differential equations to the corresponding
solutions and (2) using the Randomized Signatures as time series representation
for classification tasks. When compared to corresponding truncated Signature
approaches, our Randomizes Signatures are more computationally efficient in
high dimensions and often lead to better accuracy and faster training. Besides
providing a new tool to extract Signatures and further validating the high
level of expressiveness of such features, we believe our results provide
interesting conceptual links between several existing research areas,
suggesting new intriguing directions for future investigations.</span>

                    <span>Recent years have witnessed the promise that reinforcement learning, coupled
with Graph Neural Network (GNN) architectures, could learn to solve hard
combinatorial optimization problems: given raw input data and an evaluator to
guide the process, the idea is to automatically learn a policy able to return
feasible and high-quality outputs. Recent work have shown promising results but
the latter were mainly evaluated on the travelling salesman problem (TSP) and
similar abstract variants such as Split Delivery Vehicle Routing Problem
(SDVRP). In this paper, we analyze how and whether recent neural architectures
can be applied to graph problems of practical importance. We thus set out to
systematically &quot;transfer&quot; these architectures to the Power and Channel
Allocation Problem (PCAP), which has practical relevance for, e.g., radio
resource allocation in wireless networks. Our experimental results suggest that
existing architectures (i) are still incapable of capturing graph structural
features and (ii) are not suitable for problems where the actions on the graph
change the graph attributes. On a positive note, we show that augmenting the
structural representation of problems with Distance Encoding is a promising
step towards the still-ambitious goal of learning multi-purpose autonomous
solvers.</span>

                    <span>Automated segmentation in medical image analysis is a challenging task that
requires a large amount of manually labeled data. However, manually annotating
medical data is often laborious, and most existing learning-based approaches
fail to accurately delineate object boundaries without effective geometric
constraints. Contrastive learning, a sub-area of self-supervised learning, has
recently been noted as a promising direction in multiple application fields. In
this work, we present a novel Contrastive Voxel-wise Representation
Distillation (CVRD) method with geometric constraints to learn global-local
visual representations for volumetric medical image segmentation with limited
annotations. Our framework can effectively learn global and local features by
capturing 3D spatial context and rich anatomical information. Specifically, we
introduce a voxel-to-volume contrastive algorithm to learn global information
from 3D images, and propose to perform local voxel-to-voxel distillation to
explicitly make use of local cues in the embedding space. Moreover, we
integrate an elastic interaction-based active contour model as a geometric
regularization term to enable fast and reliable object delineations in an
end-to-end learning manner. Results on the Atrial Segmentation Challenge
dataset demonstrate superiority of our proposed scheme, especially in a setting
with a very limited number of annotated data. The code will be available at

                    <span>Unsupervised learning has recently made exceptional progress because of the
development of more effective contrastive learning methods. However, CNNs are
prone to depend on low-level features that humans deem non-semantic. This
dependency has been conjectured to induce a lack of robustness to image
perturbations or domain shift. In this paper, we show that by generating
carefully designed negative samples, contrastive learning can learn more robust
representations with less dependence on such features. Contrastive learning
utilizes positive pairs that preserve semantic information while perturbing
superficial features in the training images. Similarly, we propose to generate
negative samples in a reversed way, where only the superfluous instead of the
semantic features are preserved. We develop two methods, texture-based and
patch-based augmentations, to generate negative samples. These samples achieve
better generalization, especially under out-of-domain settings. We also analyze
our method and the generated texture-based samples, showing that texture
features are indispensable in classifying particular ImageNet classes and
especially finer classes. We also show that model bias favors texture and shape
features differently under different test settings. Our code, trained models,
and ImageNet-Texture dataset can be found at

                    <span>Recent research has shown that graph neural networks (GNNs) can learn
policies for locomotion control that are as effective as a typical multi-layer
perceptron (MLP), with superior transfer and multi-task performance (Wang et
al., 2018; Huang et al., 2020). Results have so far been limited to training on
small agents, with the performance of GNNs deteriorating rapidly as the number
of sensors and actuators grows. A key motivation for the use of GNNs in the
supervised learning setting is their applicability to large graphs, but this
benefit has not yet been realised for locomotion control. We identify the
weakness with a common GNN architecture that causes this poor scaling:
overfitting in the MLPs within the network that encode, decode, and propagate
messages. To combat this, we introduce Snowflake, a GNN training method for
high-dimensional continuous control that freezes parameters in parts of the
network that suffer from overfitting. Snowflake significantly boosts the
performance of GNNs for locomotion control on large agents, now matching the
performance of MLPs, and with superior transfer properties.</span>

vehicle coordination can be modeled as Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning
(MARL) tasks. QMIX, a widely popular MARL algorithm, has been used as a
baseline for the benchmark environments, e.g., Starcraft Multi-Agent Challenge
(SMAC), Difficulty-Enhanced Predator-Prey (DEPP). Recent variants of QMIX
target relaxing the monotonicity constraint of QMIX, allowing for performance
improvement in SMAC. In this paper, we investigate the code-level optimizations
of these variants and the monotonicity constraint. (1) We find that such
improvements of the variants are significantly affected by various code-level
optimizations. (2) The experiment results show that QMIX with normalized
optimizations outperforms other works in SMAC; (3) beyond the common wisdom
from these works, the monotonicity constraint can improve sample efficiency in
SMAC and DEPP. We also discuss why monotonicity constraints work well in purely
cooperative tasks with a theoretical analysis. We open-source the code at

                    <span>Bike Sharing Systems (BSSs) are emerging as an innovative transportation
service. Ensuring the proper functioning of a BSS is crucial given that these
systems are committed to eradicating many of the current global concerns, by
promoting environmental and economic sustainability and contributing to
improving the life quality of the population. Good knowledge of users&#x27;
transition patterns is a decisive contribution to the quality and operability
of the service. The analogous and unbalanced users&#x27; transition patterns cause
these systems to suffer from bicycle imbalance, leading to a drastic customer
loss in the long term. Strategies for bicycle rebalancing become important to
tackle this problem and for this, bicycle traffic prediction is essential, as
it allows to operate more efficiently and to react in advance. In this work, we
propose a bicycle trips predictor based on Graph Neural Network embeddings,
taking into consideration station groupings, meteorology conditions,
geographical distances, and trip patterns. We evaluated our approach in the New
York City BSS (CitiBike) data and compared it with four baselines, including
the non-clustered approach. To address our problem&#x27;s specificities, we
developed the Adaptive Transition Constraint Clustering Plus (AdaTC+)
algorithm, eliminating shortcomings of previous work. Our experiments evidence
the clustering pertinence (88% accuracy compared with 83% without clustering)
and which clustering technique best suits this problem. Accuracy on the Link
Prediction task is always higher for AdaTC+ than benchmark clustering methods
when the stations are the same, while not degrading performance when the
network is upgraded, in a mismatch with the trained model.</span>

                    <span>Automating machine learning has achieved remarkable technological
developments in recent years, and building an automated machine learning
pipeline is now an essential task. The model ensemble is the technique of
combining multiple models to get a better and more robust model. However,
existing automated machine learning tends to be simplistic in handling the
model ensemble, where the ensemble strategy is fixed, such as stacked
generalization. There have been many techniques on different ensemble methods,
especially ensemble selection, and the fixed ensemble strategy limits the upper
limit of the model&#x27;s performance. In this article, we present a novel framework
for automated machine learning. Our framework incorporates advances in dynamic
ensemble selection, and to our best knowledge, our approach is the first in the
field of AutoML to search and optimize ensemble strategies. In the comparison
experiments, our method outperforms the state-of-the-art automated machine
learning frameworks with the same CPU time in 42 classification datasets from
the OpenML platform. Ablation experiments on our framework validate the
effectiveness of our proposed method.</span>

                    <span>Recent studies have highlighted adversarial examples as ubiquitous threats to
the deep neural network (DNN) based speech recognition systems. In this work,
we present a U-Net based attention model, U-Net$_{At}$, to enhance adversarial
speech signals. Specifically, we evaluate the model performance by
interpretable speech recognition metrics and discuss the model performance by
the augmented adversarial training. Our experiments show that our proposed
U-Net$_{At}$ improves the perceptual evaluation of speech quality (PESQ) from
1.13 to 2.78, speech transmission index (STI) from 0.65 to 0.75, short-term
objective intelligibility (STOI) from 0.83 to 0.96 on the task of speech
enhancement with adversarial speech examples. We conduct experiments on the
automatic speech recognition (ASR) task with adversarial audio attacks. We find
that (i) temporal features learned by the attention network are capable of
enhancing the robustness of DNN based ASR models; (ii) the generalization power
of DNN based ASR model could be enhanced by applying adversarial training with
an additive adversarial data augmentation. The ASR metric on word-error-rates
(WERs) shows that there is an absolute 2.22 $\%$ decrease under gradient-based
perturbation, and an absolute 2.03 $\%$ decrease, under evolutionary-optimized
perturbation, which suggests that our enhancement models with adversarial
training can further secure a resilient ASR system.</span>

                    <span>In the autonomous driving field, the fusion of human knowledge into Deep
Reinforcement Learning (DRL) is often based on the human demonstration recorded
in the simulated environment. This limits the generalization and the
feasibility of application in real-world traffic. We proposed a two-stage DRL
method, that learns from real-world human driving to achieve performance that
is superior to the pure DRL agent. Training a DRL agent is done within a
framework for CARLA with Robot Operating System (ROS). For evaluation, we
designed different real-world driving scenarios to compare the proposed
two-stage DRL agent with the pure DRL agent. After extracting the &#x27;good&#x27;
behavior from the human driver, such as anticipation in a signalized
intersection, the agent becomes more efficient and drives safer, which makes
this autonomous agent more adapt to Human-Robot Interaction (HRI) traffic.</span>

                    <span>Neural networks with the Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) nonlinearity are
described by a vector of parameters $\theta$, and realized as a piecewise
linear continuous function $R_{\theta}: x \in \mathbb R^{d} \mapsto
R_{\theta}(x) \in \mathbb R^{k}$. Natural scalings and permutations operations
on the parameters $\theta$ leave the realization unchanged, leading to
equivalence classes of parameters that yield the same realization. These
considerations in turn lead to the notion of identifiability -- the ability to
recover (the equivalence class of) $\theta$ from the sole knowledge of its
realization $R_{\theta}$. The overall objective of this paper is to introduce
an embedding for ReLU neural networks of any depth, $\Phi(\theta)$, that is
invariant to scalings and that provides a locally linear parameterization of
the realization of the network. Leveraging these two key properties, we derive
some conditions under which a deep ReLU network is indeed locally identifiable
from the knowledge of the realization on a finite set of samples $x_{i} \in
\mathbb R^{d}$. We study the shallow case in more depth, establishing necessary
and sufficient conditions for the network to be identifiable from a bounded
subset $\mathcal X \subseteq \mathbb R^{d}$.</span>

those that adaptively mask the network weights throughout training. By
examining this masking, or dropout, in the linear case, we uncover a duality
between such adaptive methods and regularization through the so-called
&quot;$\eta$-trick&quot; that casts both as iteratively reweighted optimizations. We show
that any dropout strategy that adapts to the weights in a monotonic way
corresponds to an effective subquadratic regularization penalty, and therefore
leads to sparse solutions. We obtain the effective penalties for several
popular sparsification strategies, which are remarkably similar to classical
penalties commonly used in sparse optimization. Considering variational dropout
as a case study, we demonstrate similar empirical behavior between the adaptive
dropout method and classical methods on the task of deep network
sparsification, validating our theory.</span>

                    <span>Human Activity Recognition (HAR) is one of the key applications of health
monitoring that requires continuous use of wearable devices to track daily
activities. This paper proposes an Adaptive CNN for energy-efficient HAR (AHAR)
suitable for low-power edge devices. Unlike traditional early exit architecture
that makes the exit decision based on classification confidence, AHAR proposes
a novel adaptive architecture that uses an output block predictor to select a
portion of the baseline architecture to use during the inference phase.
Experimental results show that traditional early exit architectures suffer from
performance loss whereas our adaptive architecture provides similar or better
performance as the baseline one while being energy-efficient. We validate our
methodology in classifying locomotion activities from two datasets- Opportunity
and w-HAR. Compared to the fog/cloud computing approaches for the Opportunity
dataset, our baseline and adaptive architecture shows a comparable weighted F1
score of 91.79%, and 91.57%, respectively. For the w-HAR dataset, our baseline
and adaptive architecture outperforms the state-of-the-art works with a
weighted F1 score of 97.55%, and 97.64%, respectively. Evaluation on real
hardware shows that our baseline architecture is significantly energy-efficient
(422.38x less) and memory-efficient (14.29x less) compared to the works on the
Opportunity dataset. For the w-HAR dataset, our baseline architecture requires
2.04x less energy and 2.18x less memory compared to the state-of-the-art work.
Moreover, experimental results show that our adaptive architecture is 12.32%
(Opportunity) and 11.14% (w-HAR) energy-efficient than our baseline while
providing similar (Opportunity) or better (w-HAR) performance with no
significant memory overhead.</span>

                    <span>Federated Learning (FL) allows multiple clients to collaboratively train a
Neural Network (NN) model on their private data without revealing the data.
Recently, several targeted poisoning attacks against FL have been introduced.
These attacks inject a backdoor into the resulting model that allows
adversary-controlled inputs to be misclassified. Existing countermeasures
against backdoor attacks are inefficient and often merely aim to exclude
deviating models from the aggregation. However, this approach also removes
benign models of clients with deviating data distributions, causing the
aggregated model to perform poorly for such clients.

To address this problem, we propose DeepSight, a novel model filtering
approach for mitigating backdoor attacks. It is based on three novel techniques
that allow to characterize the distribution of data used to train model updates
and seek to measure fine-grained differences in the internal structure and
outputs of NNs. Using these techniques, DeepSight can identify suspicious model
updates. We also develop a scheme that can accurately cluster model updates.
Combining the results of both components, DeepSight is able to identify and
eliminate model clusters containing poisoned models with high attack impact. We
also show that the backdoor contributions of possibly undetected poisoned
models can be effectively mitigated with existing weight clipping-based
defenses. We evaluate the performance and effectiveness of DeepSight and show
that it can mitigate state-of-the-art backdoor attacks with a negligible impact
on the model&#x27;s performance on benign data.</span>

                    <span>The staple of human intelligence is the capability of acquiring knowledge in
a continuous fashion. In stark contrast, Deep Networks forget catastrophically
and, for this reason, the sub-field of Class-Incremental Continual Learning
fosters methods that learn a sequence of tasks incrementally, blending
sequentially-gained knowledge into a comprehensive prediction.

This work aims at assessing and overcoming the pitfalls of our previous
proposal Dark Experience Replay (DER), a simple and effective approach that
combines rehearsal and Knowledge Distillation. Inspired by the way our minds
constantly rewrite past recollections and set expectations for the future, we
endow our model with the abilities to i) revise its replay memory to welcome
novel information regarding past data ii) pave the way for learning yet unseen
classes.

We show that the application of these strategies leads to remarkable
improvements; indeed, the resulting method - termed eXtended-DER (X-DER) -
outperforms the state of the art on both standard benchmarks (such as CIFAR-100
and miniImagenet) and a novel one here introduced. To gain a better
understanding, we further provide extensive ablation studies that corroborate
and extend the findings of our previous research (e.g. the value of Knowledge
Distillation and flatter minima in continual learning setups).</span>

                    <span>Large sparse linear systems of equations are ubiquitous in science and
engineering, such as those arising from discretizations of partial differential
equations. Algebraic multigrid (AMG) methods are one of the most common methods
of solving such linear systems, with an extensive body of underlying
mathematical theory. A system of linear equations defines a graph on the set of
unknowns and each level of a multigrid solver requires the selection of an
appropriate coarse graph along with restriction and interpolation operators
that map to and from the coarse representation. The efficiency of the multigrid
solver depends critically on this selection and many selection methods have
been developed over the years. Recently, it has been demonstrated that it is
possible to directly learn the AMG interpolation and restriction operators,
given a coarse graph selection. In this paper, we consider the complementary
problem of learning to coarsen graphs for a multigrid solver, a necessary step
in developing fully learnable AMG methods. We propose a method using a
reinforcement learning (RL) agent based on graph neural networks (GNNs), which
can learn to perform graph coarsening on small planar training graphs and then
be applied to unstructured large planar graphs, assuming bounded node degree.
We demonstrate that this method can produce better coarse graphs than existing
algorithms, even as the graph size increases and other properties of the graph
are varied. We also propose an efficient inference procedure for performing
graph coarsening that results in linear time complexity in graph size.</span>

autonomous driving, and smart everything which brings together massive and
diverse IoT devices occupying the radio frequency (RF) spectrum. Along with
spectrum crunch and throughput challenges, such a massive scale of wireless

a candidate technology that can be combined with cryptographic and zero-trust

                    <span>Social networks play a fundamental role in propagation of information and
news. Characterizing the content of the messages becomes vital for different
tasks, like breaking news detection, personalized message recommendation, fake
users detection, information flow characterization and others. However, Twitter
posts are short and often less coherent than other text documents, which makes
it challenging to apply text mining algorithms to these datasets efficiently.
Tweet-pooling (aggregating tweets into longer documents) has been shown to
improve automatic topic decomposition, but the performance achieved in this
task varies depending on the pooling method.

In this paper, we propose a new pooling scheme for topic modeling in Twitter,
which groups tweets whose authors belong to the same community (group of users
who mainly interact with each other but not with other groups) on a user
interaction graph. We present a complete evaluation of this methodology, state
of the art schemes and previous pooling models in terms of the cluster quality,
document retrieval tasks performance and supervised machine learning
classification score. Results show that our Community polling method
outperformed other methods on the majority of metrics in two heterogeneous
datasets, while also reducing the running time. This is useful when dealing
with big amounts of noisy and short user-generated social media texts. Overall,
our findings contribute to an improved methodology for identifying the latent
topics in a Twitter dataset, without the need of modifying the basic machinery
of a topic decomposition model.</span>

                    <span>Humans and other animals learn to extract general concepts from sensory
experience without extensive teaching. This ability is thought to be
facilitated by offline states like sleep where previous experiences are
systemically replayed. However, the characteristic creative nature of dreams
suggests that learning semantic representations may go beyond merely replaying
previous experiences. We support this hypothesis by implementing a cortical
architecture inspired by generative adversarial networks (GANs). Learning in
our model is organized across three different global brain states mimicking
wakefulness, NREM and REM sleep, optimizing different, but complementary
objective functions. We train the model on standard datasets of natural images
and evaluate the quality of the learned representations. Our results suggest
that generating new, virtual sensory inputs via adversarial dreaming during REM
sleep is essential for extracting semantic concepts, while replaying episodic
memories via perturbed dreaming during NREM sleep improves the robustness of
latent representations. The model provides a new computational perspective on
sleep states, memory replay and dreams and suggests a cortical implementation
of GANs.</span>

                    <span>Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have recently attracted considerable
attention in the AI community due to its ability to generate high-quality data
of significant statistical resemblance to real data. Fundamentally, GAN is a
game between two neural networks trained in an adversarial manner to reach a
zero-sum Nash equilibrium profile. Despite the improvement accomplished in GANs
in the last few years, several issues remain to be solved. This paper reviews
the literature on the game theoretic aspects of GANs and addresses how game
theory models can address specific challenges of generative model and improve
the GAN&#x27;s performance. We first present some preliminaries, including the basic
GAN model and some game theory background. We then present taxonomy to classify
state-of-the-art solutions into three main categories: modified game models,
modified architectures, and modified learning methods. The classification is
based on modifications made to the basic GAN model by proposed game-theoretic
approaches in the literature. We then explore the objectives of each category
and discuss recent works in each category. Finally, we discuss the remaining
challenges in this field and present future research directions.</span>

                    <span>At the end of 2019, the latest novel coronavirus Sars-CoV-2 emerged as a
significant acute respiratory disease that has become a global pandemic.
Countries like Brazil have had difficulty in dealing with the virus due to the
high socioeconomic difference of states and municipalities. Therefore, this
study presents a new approach using different machine learning and deep
learning algorithms applied to Brazilian COVID-19 data. First, a clustering
algorithm is used to identify counties with similar sociodemographic behavior,
while Benford&#x27;s law is used to check for data manipulation. Based on these
results we are able to correctly model SARIMA models based on the clusters to
predict new daily cases. The unsupervised machine learning techniques optimized
the process of defining the parameters of the SARIMA model. This framework can
also be useful to propose confinement scenarios during the so-called second
wave. We have used the 645 counties from S\~ao Paulo state, the most populous
state in Brazil. However, this methodology can be used in other states or
countries. This paper demonstrates how different techniques of machine
learning, deep learning, data mining and statistics can be used together to
produce important results when dealing with pandemic data. Although the
findings cannot be used exclusively to assess and influence policy decisions,
they offer an alternative to the ineffective measures that have been used.</span>

                    <span>The actor-critic RL is widely used in various robotic control tasks. By
viewing the actor-critic RL from the perspective of variational inference (VI),
the policy network is trained to obtain the approximate posterior of actions
given the optimality criteria. However, in practice, the actor-critic RL may
yield suboptimal policy estimates due to the amortization gap and insufficient
exploration. In this work, inspired by the previous use of Hamiltonian Monte
Carlo (HMC) in VI, we propose to integrate the policy network of actor-critic
RL with HMC, which is termed as {\it Hamiltonian Policy}. As such we propose to
evolve actions from the base policy according to HMC, and our proposed method
has many benefits. First, HMC can improve the policy distribution to better
approximate the posterior and hence reduce the amortization gap. Second, HMC
can also guide the exploration more to the regions of action spaces with higher
Q values, enhancing the exploration efficiency. Further, instead of directly
applying HMC into RL, we propose a new leapfrog operator to simulate the
Hamiltonian dynamics. Finally, in safe RL problems, we find that the proposed
method can not only improve the achieved return, but also reduce safety
constraint violations by discarding potentially unsafe actions. With
comprehensive empirical experiments on continuous control baselines, including
MuJoCo and PyBullet Roboschool, we show that the proposed approach is a
data-efficient and easy-to-implement improvement over previous actor-critic
methods.</span>

realize feature selection, classification and knowledge representation at the

feature selections. But low efficiency and low accuracy are its main drawbacks
that limits its application ability. In this paper,corresponding to the
accuracy, we first find the ineffectiveness of rough set because of
overfitting, especially in processing noise attribute, and propose a robust
measurement for an attribute, called relative importance.we proposed the
concept of &quot;rough concept tree&quot; for knowledge representation and

                    <span>Running machine learning algorithms on large and rapidly growing volumes of
data is often computationally expensive, one common trick to reduce the size of
a data set, and thus reduce the computational cost of machine learning
algorithms, is \emph{probability sampling}. It creates a sampled data set by
including each data point from the original data set with a known probability.
Although the benefit of running machine learning algorithms on the reduced data
set is obvious, one major concern is that the performance of the solution
obtained from samples might be much worse than that of the optimal solution
when using the full data set. In this paper, we examine the performance loss
caused by probability sampling in the context of adaptive submodular
maximization. We consider a simple probability sampling method which selects
each data point with probability $r\in[0,1]$. If we set the sampling rate
$r&#x3D;1$, our problem reduces to finding a solution based on the original full
data set. We define sampling gap as the largest ratio between the optimal
solution obtained from the full data set and the optimal solution obtained from
the samples, over independence systems. %It captures the performance loss of
the optimal solution caused by the probability sampling. Our main contribution
is to show that if the utility function is policywise submodular, then for a
given sampling rate $r$, the sampling gap is both upper bounded and lower
bounded by $1/r$. One immediate implication of our result is that if we can
find an $\alpha$-approximation solution based on a sampled data set (which is
sampled at sampling rate $r$), then this solution achieves an $\alpha r$
approximation ratio against the optimal solution when using the full data set.</span>

                    <span>Classification of malware families is crucial for a comprehensive
understanding of how they can infect devices, computers, or systems. Thus,
malware identification enables security researchers and incident responders to
take precautions against malware and accelerate mitigation. API call sequences
made by malware are widely utilized features by machine and deep learning
models for malware classification as these sequences represent the behavior of
malware. However, traditional machine and deep learning models remain incapable
of capturing sequence relationships between API calls. On the other hand, the
transformer-based models process sequences as a whole and learn relationships
between API calls due to multi-head attention mechanisms and positional
embeddings. Our experiments demonstrate that the transformer model with one
transformer block layer surpassed the widely used base architecture, LSTM.
Moreover, BERT or CANINE, pre-trained transformer models, outperformed in
classifying highly imbalanced malware families according to evaluation metrics,
F1-score, and AUC score. Furthermore, the proposed bagging-based random
transformer forest (RTF), an ensemble of BERT or CANINE, has reached the
state-of-the-art evaluation scores on three out of four datasets, particularly
state-of-the-art F1-score of 0.6149 on one of the commonly used benchmark

                    <span>FPGA-specific DNN architectures using the native LUTs as independently
trainable inference operators have been shown to achieve favorable
area-accuracy and energy-accuracy tradeoffs. The first work in this area,
LUTNet, exhibited state-of-the-art performance for standard DNN benchmarks. In
this paper, we propose the learned optimization of such LUT-based topologies,
resulting in higher-efficiency designs than via the direct use of
off-the-shelf, hand-designed networks. Existing implementations of this class
of architecture require the manual specification of the number of inputs per
LUT, K. Choosing appropriate K a priori is challenging, and doing so at even
high granularity, e.g. per layer, is a time-consuming and error-prone process
that leaves FPGAs&#x27; spatial flexibility underexploited. Furthermore, prior works
see LUT inputs connected randomly, which does not guarantee a good choice of
network topology. To address these issues, we propose logic shrinkage, a
fine-grained netlist pruning methodology enabling K to be automatically learned
for every LUT in a neural network targeted for FPGA inference. By removing LUT
inputs determined to be of low importance, our method increases the efficiency
of the resultant accelerators. Our GPU-friendly solution to LUT input removal
is capable of processing large topologies during their training with negligible
slowdown. With logic shrinkage, we better the area and energy efficiency of the
best-performing LUTNet implementation of the CNV network classifying CIFAR-10
by 1.54x and 1.31x, respectively, while matching its accuracy. This
implementation also reaches 2.71x the area efficiency of an equally accurate,
heavily pruned BNN. On ImageNet with the Bi-Real Net architecture, employment
of logic shrinkage results in a post-synthesis area reduction of 2.67x vs
LUTNet, allowing for implementation that was previously impossible on today&#x27;s
largest FPGAs.</span>

                    <span>In practical data analysis under noisy environment, it is common to first use
robust methods to identify outliers, and then to conduct further analysis after
removing the outliers. In this paper, we consider statistical inference of the
model estimated after outliers are removed, which can be interpreted as a
selective inference (SI) problem. To use conditional SI framework, it is
necessary to characterize the events of how the robust method identifies
outliers. Unfortunately, the existing methods cannot be directly used here
because they are applicable to the case where the selection events can be
represented by linear/quadratic constraints. In this paper, we propose a
conditional SI method for popular robust regressions by using homotopy method.
We show that the proposed conditional SI method is applicable to a wide class
of robust regression and outlier detection methods and has good empirical
performance on both synthetic data and real data experiments.</span>

unprecedented growth in the last few years. This success can be partly
attributed to the advancements made in the sub-fields of AI such as machine
learning, computer vision, and natural language processing. Much of the growth
in these fields has been made possible with deep learning, a sub-area of
machine learning that uses artificial neural networks. This has created
significant interest in the integration of vision and language. In this survey,
we focus on ten prominent tasks that integrate language and vision by
discussing their problem formulation, methods, existing datasets, evaluation
measures, and compare the results obtained with corresponding state-of-the-art
methods. Our efforts go beyond earlier surveys which are either task-specific
or concentrate only on one type of visual content, i.e., image or video.
Furthermore, we also provide some potential future directions in this field of
research with an anticipation that this survey stimulates innovative thoughts
and ideas to address the existing challenges and build new applications.</span>

tools in diverse areas of science. Although many different methods exist, their
performance is often insufficient for providing quick insight into many
contemporary datasets, and the unsupervised mode of use prevents the users from
utilizing the methods for dataset exploration and fine-tuning the details for
improved visualization quality. We present BlosSOM, a high-performance
semi-supervised dimensionality reduction software for interactive
user-steerable visualization of high-dimensional datasets with millions of
individual data points. BlosSOM builds on a GPU-accelerated implementation of
the EmbedSOM algorithm, complemented by several landmark-based algorithms for
interfacing the unsupervised model learning algorithms with the user
supervision. We show the application of BlosSOM on realistic datasets, where it
helps to produce high-quality visualizations that incorporate user-specified

science areas such as single-cell cytometry, and provide a fast and efficient

                    <span>Hybrid analog and digital beamforming transceivers are instrumental in
addressing the challenge of expensive hardware and high training overheads in
the next generation millimeter-wave (mm-Wave) massive MIMO (multiple-input
multiple-output) systems. However, lack of fully digital beamforming in hybrid
architectures and short coherence times at mm-Wave impose additional
constraints on the channel estimation. Prior works on addressing these
challenges have focused largely on narrowband channels wherein
optimization-based or greedy algorithms were employed to derive hybrid
beamformers. In this paper, we introduce a deep learning (DL) approach for
channel estimation and hybrid beamforming for frequency-selective, wideband
mm-Wave systems. In particular, we consider a massive MIMO Orthogonal Frequency
Division Multiplexing (MIMO-OFDM) system and propose three different DL
frameworks comprising convolutional neural networks (CNNs), which accept the
raw data of received signal as input and yield channel estimates and the hybrid
beamformers at the output. We also introduce both offline and online prediction
schemes. Numerical experiments demonstrate that, compared to the current
state-of-the-art optimization and DL methods, our approach provides higher
spectral efficiency, lesser computational cost and fewer number of pilot
signals, and higher tolerance against the deviations in the received pilot
data, corrupted channel matrix, and propagation environment.</span>

                    <span>We study the random reshuffling (RR) method for smooth nonconvex optimization
problems with a finite-sum structure. Though this method is widely utilized in
practice such as the training of neural networks, its convergence behavior is
only understood in several limited settings. In this paper, under the
well-known Kurdyka-Lojasiewicz (KL) inequality, we establish strong limit-point
convergence results for RR with appropriate diminishing step sizes, namely, the
whole sequence of iterates generated by RR is convergent and converges to a
single stationary point in an almost sure sense. In addition, we derive the
corresponding rate of convergence, depending on the KL exponent and the
suitably selected diminishing step sizes. When the KL exponent lies in
$[0,\frac12]$, the convergence is at a rate of $\mathcal{O}(t^{-1})$ with $t$
counting the iteration number. When the KL exponent belongs to $(\frac12,1)$,
our derived convergence rate is of the form $\mathcal{O}(t^{-q})$ with $q\in
(0,1)$ depending on the KL exponent. The standard KL inequality-based
convergence analysis framework only applies to algorithms with a certain
descent property. We conduct a novel convergence analysis for the non-descent
RR method with diminishing step sizes based on the KL inequality, which
generalizes the standard KL framework. We summarize our main steps and core
ideas in an informal analysis framework, which is of independent interest. As a
direct application of this framework, we also establish similar strong
limit-point convergence results for the reshuffled proximal point method.</span>

                    <span>Self-supervised representation learning has made significant leaps fueled by
progress in contrastive learning, which seeks to learn transformations that
embed positive input pairs nearby, while pushing negative pairs far apart.
While positive pairs can be generated reliably (e.g., as different views of the
same image), it is difficult to accurately establish negative pairs, defined as
samples from different images regardless of their semantic content or visual
features. A fundamental problem in contrastive learning is mitigating the
effects of false negatives. Contrasting false negatives induces two critical
issues in representation learning: discarding semantic information and slow
convergence. In this paper, we propose novel approaches to identify false
negatives, as well as two strategies to mitigate their effect, i.e. false
negative elimination and attraction, while systematically performing rigorous
evaluations to study this problem in detail. Our method exhibits consistent
improvements over existing contrastive learning-based methods. Without labels,
we identify false negatives with 40% accuracy among 1000 semantic classes on
ImageNet, and achieve 5.8% absolute improvement in top-1 accuracy over the
previous state-of-the-art when finetuning with 1% labels. Our code is available

                    <span>The second edition of Deep Learning Interviews is home to hundreds of
fully-solved problems, from a wide range of key topics in AI. It is designed to
both rehearse interview or exam specific topics and provide machine learning
M.Sc./Ph.D. students, and those awaiting an interview a well-organized overview
of the field. The problems it poses are tough enough to cut your teeth on and
to dramatically improve your skills-but they&#x27;re framed within thought-provoking
questions and engaging stories. That is what makes the volume so specifically
valuable to students and job seekers: it provides them with the ability to
speak confidently and quickly on any relevant topic, to answer technical
questions clearly and correctly, and to fully understand the purpose and
meaning of interview questions and answers. Those are powerful, indispensable
advantages to have when walking into the interview room. The book&#x27;s contents is
a large inventory of numerous topics relevant to DL job interviews and graduate
level exams. That places this work at the forefront of the growing trend in
science to teach a core set of practical mathematical and computational skills.
It is widely accepted that the training of every computer scientist must
include the fundamental theorems of ML, and AI appears in the curriculum of
nearly every university. This volume is designed as an excellent reference for
graduates of such programs.</span>

                    <span>Recently, Zhang et al.(2021) developed a new neural network architecture
based on $\ell_\infty$-distance functions, which naturally possesses certified
$\ell_\infty$ robustness by its construction. Despite rigorous theoretical
guarantees, the model so far can only achieve comparable performance to
conventional networks. In this paper, we make the following two contributions:
$\mathrm{(i)}$ We demonstrate that $\ell_\infty$-distance nets enjoy a
fundamental advantage in certified robustness over conventional networks (under
typical certification approaches); $\mathrm{(ii)}$ With an improved training
process we are able to significantly boost the certified accuracy of
$\ell_\infty$-distance nets. Our training approach largely alleviates the
optimization problem that arose in the previous training scheme, in particular,
the unexpected large Lipschitz constant due to the use of a crucial trick
called $\ell_p$-relaxation. The core of our training approach is a novel
objective function that combines scaled cross-entropy loss and clipped hinge
loss with a decaying mixing coefficient. Experiments show that using the
proposed training strategy, the certified accuracy of $\ell_\infty$-distance
net can be dramatically improved from 33.30% to 40.06% on CIFAR-10
($\epsilon&#x3D;8/255$), meanwhile outperforming other approaches in this area by a
large margin. Our results clearly demonstrate the effectiveness and potential
of $\ell_\infty$-distance net for certified robustness. Codes are available at

                    <span>Federated learning (FL) has emerged as a popular methodology for distributing
machine learning across wireless edge devices. In this work, we consider
optimizing the tradeoff between model performance and resource utilization in
FL, under device-server communication delays and device computation
heterogeneity. Our proposed StoFedDelAv algorithm incorporates a local-global
model combiner into the FL synchronization step. We theoretically characterize
the convergence behavior of StoFedDelAv and obtain the optimal combiner
weights, which consider the global model delay and expected local gradient
error at each device. We then formulate a network-aware optimization problem
which tunes the minibatch sizes of the devices to jointly minimize energy
consumption and machine learning training loss, and solve the non-convex
problem through a series of convex approximations. Our simulations reveal that
StoFedDelAv outperforms the current art in FL in terms of model convergence
speed and network resource utilization when the minibatch size and the combiner
weights are adjusted. Additionally, our method can reduce the number of uplink
communication rounds required during the model training period to reach the
same accuracy.</span>

                    <span>Data augmentation is a simple yet effective way to improve the robustness of
deep neural networks (DNNs). Diversity and hardness are two complementary
dimensions of data augmentation to achieve robustness. For example, AugMix
explores random compositions of a diverse set of augmentations to enhance
broader coverage, while adversarial training generates adversarially hard
samples to spot the weakness. Motivated by this, we propose a data augmentation
framework, termed AugMax, to unify the two aspects of diversity and hardness.
AugMax first randomly samples multiple augmentation operators and then learns
an adversarial mixture of the selected operators. Being a stronger form of data
augmentation, AugMax leads to a significantly augmented input distribution
which makes model training more challenging. To solve this problem, we further
design a disentangled normalization module, termed DuBIN
(Dual-Batch-and-Instance Normalization), that disentangles the instance-wise
feature heterogeneity arising from AugMax. Experiments show that AugMax-DuBIN
leads to significantly improved out-of-distribution robustness, outperforming
prior arts by 3.03%, 3.49%, 1.82% and 0.71% on CIFAR10-C, CIFAR100-C, Tiny
ImageNet-C and ImageNet-C. Codes and pretrained models are available:

                    <span>Counterfactual Regret Minimization (CFR) has achieved many fascinating
results in solving large-scale Imperfect Information Games (IIGs). Neural
network approximation CFR (neural CFR) is one of the promising techniques that
can reduce computation and memory consumption by generalizing decision
information between similar states. Current neural CFR algorithms have to
approximate cumulative regrets. However, efficient and accurate approximation
in a large-scale IIG is still a tough challenge. In this paper, a new CFR
variant, Recursive CFR (ReCFR), is proposed. In ReCFR, Recursive Substitute
Values (RSVs) are learned and used to replace cumulative regrets. It is proven
that ReCFR can converge to a Nash equilibrium at a rate of
$O(\frac{1}{\sqrt{T}})$. Based on ReCFR, a new model-free neural CFR with
bootstrap learning, Neural ReCFR-B, is proposed. Due to the recursive and
non-cumulative nature of RSVs, Neural ReCFR-B has lower-variance training
targets than other neural CFRs. Experimental results show that Neural ReCFR-B
is competitive with the state-of-the-art neural CFR algorithms at a much lower
training cost.</span>

                    <span>Resting-state fMRI is commonly used for diagnosing Autism Spectrum Disorder
(ASD) by using network-based functional connectivity. It has been shown that
ASD is associated with brain regions and their inter-connections. However,
discriminating based on connectivity patterns among imaging data of the control
population and that of ASD patients&#x27; brains is a non-trivial task. In order to
tackle said classification task, we propose a novel deep learning architecture
(MHATC) consisting of multi-head attention and temporal consolidation modules
for classifying an individual as a patient of ASD. The devised architecture
results from an in-depth analysis of the limitations of current deep neural
network solutions for similar applications. Our approach is not only robust but
computationally efficient, which can allow its adoption in a variety of other
research and clinical settings.</span>

                    <span>Inferring reward functions from demonstrations and pairwise preferences are
auspicious approaches for aligning Reinforcement Learning (RL) agents with
human intentions. However, state-of-the art methods typically focus on learning
a single reward model, thus rendering it difficult to trade off different
reward functions from multiple experts. We propose Multi-Objective Reinforced
Active Learning (MORAL), a novel method for combining diverse demonstrations of
social norms into a Pareto-optimal policy. Through maintaining a distribution
over scalarization weights, our approach is able to interactively tune a deep
RL agent towards a variety of preferences, while eliminating the need for
computing multiple policies. We empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of
MORAL in two scenarios, which model a delivery and an emergency task that
require an agent to act in the presence of normative conflicts. Overall, we
consider our research a step towards multi-objective RL with learned rewards,
bridging the gap between current reward learning and machine ethics literature.</span>

                    <span>We propose a recurrent neural network-based spatio-temporal framework named
maskGRU for the detection and tracking of small objects in videos. While there
have been many developments in the area of object tracking in recent years,
tracking a small moving object amid other moving objects and actors (such as a
ball amid moving players in sports footage) continues to be a difficult task.
Existing spatio-temporal networks, such as convolutional Gated Recurrent Units
(convGRUs), are difficult to train and have trouble accurately tracking small
objects under such conditions. To overcome these difficulties, we developed the
maskGRU framework that uses a weighted sum of the internal hidden state
produced by a convGRU and a 3-channel mask of the tracked object&#x27;s predicted
bounding box as the hidden state to be used at the next time step of the
underlying convGRU. We believe the technique of incorporating a mask into the
hidden state through a weighted sum has two benefits: controlling the effect of
exploding gradients and introducing an attention-like mechanism into the
network by indicating where in the previous video frame the object is located.
Our experiments show that maskGRU outperforms convGRU at tracking objects that
are small relative to the video resolution even in the presence of other moving
objects.</span>

                    <span>We propose an approach to modeling irregularly spaced sequences of discrete
events. We begin with a continuous-time variant of the Transformer, which was
originally formulated (Vaswani et al., 2017) for sequences without timestamps.
We embed a possible event (or other boolean fact) at time $t$ by using
attention over the events that occurred at times $&lt; t$ (and the facts that were
true when they occurred). We control this attention using pattern-matching
logic rules that relate events and facts that share participants. These rules
determine which previous events will be attended to, as well as how to
transform the embeddings of the events and facts into the attentional queries,
keys, and values. Other logic rules describe how to change the set of facts in
response to events. Our approach closely follows Mei et al. (2020a), and adopts
their Datalog Through Time formalism for logic rules. As in that work, a domain
expert first writes a set of logic rules that establishes the set of possible
events and other facts at each time $t$. Each possible event or other fact is
embedded using a neural architecture that is derived from the rules that
established it. Our only difference from Mei et al. (2020a) is that we derive a
flatter, attention-based neural architecture whereas they used a more serial
LSTM architecture. We find that our attention-based approach performs about
equally well on the RoboCup dataset, where the logic rules play an important
role in improving performance. We also compared these two methods with two
previous attention-based methods (Zuo et al., 2020; Zhang et al., 2020a) on
simpler synthetic and real domains without logic rules, and found our proposed
approach to be at least as good, and sometimes better, than each of the other
three methods.</span>

                    <span>This paper presents an ensemble forecasting method that shows strong results
on the M4Competition dataset by decreasing feature and model selection
assumptions, termed DONUT(DO Not UTilize human assumptions). Our assumption
reductions, consisting mainly of auto-generated features and a more diverse
model pool for the ensemble, significantly outperforms the
statistical-feature-based ensemble method FFORMA by Montero-Manso et al.
(2020). Furthermore, we investigate feature extraction with a Long short-term
memory Network(LSTM) Autoencoder and find that such features contain crucial
information not captured by traditional statistical feature approaches. The
ensemble weighting model uses both LSTM features and statistical features to
combine the models accurately. Analysis of feature importance and interaction
show a slight superiority for LSTM features over the statistical ones alone.
Clustering analysis shows that different essential LSTM features are different
from most statistical features and each other. We also find that increasing the
solution space of the weighting model by augmenting the ensemble with new
models is something the weighting model learns to use, explaining part of the
accuracy gains. Lastly, we present a formal ex-post-facto analysis of optimal
combination and selection for ensembles, quantifying differences through linear
optimization on the M4 dataset. We also include a short proof that model
combination is superior to model selection, a posteriori.</span>

resources are essential to human intelligence. An important component of this
metacognitive ability is deciding whether to continue thinking about what to do
and move on to the next decision. Here, we show that people acquire this
ability through learning and reverse-engineer the underlying learning
mechanisms. Using a process-tracing paradigm that externalises human planning,
we find that people quickly adapt how much planning they perform to the cost
and benefit of planning. To discover the underlying metacognitive learning
mechanisms we augmented a set of reinforcement learning models with
metacognitive features and performed Bayesian model selection. Our results
suggest that the metacognitive ability to adjust the amount of planning might

                    <span>Knowledge distillation is initially introduced to utilize additional
supervision from a single teacher model for the student model training. To
boost the student performance, some recent variants attempt to exploit diverse
knowledge sources from multiple teachers. However, existing studies mainly
integrate knowledge from diverse sources by averaging over multiple teacher
predictions or combining them using other various label-free strategies, which
may mislead student in the presence of low-quality teacher predictions. To
tackle this problem, we propose Confidence-Aware Multi-teacher Knowledge
Distillation (CA-MKD), which adaptively assigns sample-wise reliability for
each teacher prediction with the help of ground-truth labels, with those
teacher predictions close to one-hot labels assigned large weights. Besides,
CA-MKD incorporates intermediate layers to further improve student performance.
Extensive experiments show that our CA-MKD consistently outperforms all
compared state-of-the-art methods across various teacher-student architectures.</span>

                    <span>It is increasingly acknowledged that a priori statistical power estimation
for planned studies with multiple model parameters is inherently a multivariate
problem. Power for individual parameters of interest cannot be reliably
estimated univariately because sampling variably in, correlation with, and
variance explained relative to one parameter will impact the power for another
parameter, all usual univariate considerations being equal. Explicit solutions
in such cases, especially for models with many parameters, are either
impractical or impossible to solve, leaving researchers with the prevailing
method of simulating power. However, point estimates for a vector of model
parameters are uncertain, and the impact of inaccuracy is unknown. In such
cases, sensitivity analysis is recommended such that multiple combinations of
possible observable parameter vectors are simulated to understand power
trade-offs. A limitation to this approach is that it is computationally
expensive to generate sufficient sensitivity combinations to accurately map the
power trade-off function in increasingly high dimensional spaces for the models
that social scientists estimate. This paper explores the efficient estimation
and graphing of statistical power for a study over varying model parameter
combinations. Optimally powering a study is crucial to ensure a minimum
probability of finding the hypothesized effect. We first demonstrate the impact
of varying parameter values on power for specific hypotheses of interest and
quantify the computational intensity of computing such a graph for a given
level of precision. Finally, we propose a simple and generalizable machine
learning inspired solution to cut the computational cost to less than 7\% of
what could be called a brute force approach. [abridged]</span>

                    <span>In many reinforcement learning (RL) applications, the observation space is
specified by human developers and restricted by physical realizations, and may
thus be subject to dramatic changes over time (e.g. increased number of
observable features). However, when the observation space changes, the previous
policy will likely fail due to the mismatch of input features, and another
policy must be trained from scratch, which is inefficient in terms of
computation and sample complexity. Following theoretical insights, we propose a
novel algorithm which extracts the latent-space dynamics in the source task,
and transfers the dynamics model to the target task to use as a model-based
regularizer. Our algorithm works for drastic changes of observation space (e.g.
from vector-based observation to image-based observation), without any
inter-task mapping or any prior knowledge of the target task. Empirical results
show that our algorithm significantly improves the efficiency and stability of
learning in the target task.</span>

                    <span>Knowledge graph embedding (KGE) has drawn great attention due to its
potential in automatic knowledge graph (KG) completion and knowledge-driven
tasks. However, recent KGE models suffer from high training cost and large
storage space, thus limiting their practicality in real-world applications. To
address this challenge, based on the latest findings in the field of
Contrastive Learning, we propose a novel KGE training framework called
Hardness-aware Low-dimensional Embedding (HaLE). Instead of the traditional
Negative Sampling, we design a new loss function based on query sampling that
can balance two important training targets, Alignment and Uniformity.
Furthermore, we analyze the hardness-aware ability of recent low-dimensional
hyperbolic models and propose a lightweight hardness-aware activation
mechanism, which can help the KGE models focus on hard instances and speed up
convergence. The experimental results show that in the limited training time,
HaLE can effectively improve the performance and training speed of KGE models
on five commonly-used datasets. The HaLE-trained models can obtain a high
prediction accuracy after training few minutes and are competitive compared to
the state-of-the-art models in both low- and high-dimensional conditions.</span>

                    <span>Lung cancer is one of the deadliest cancers, and in part its effective
diagnosis and treatment depend on the accurate delineation of the tumor.
Human-centered segmentation, which is currently the most common approach, is
subject to inter-observer variability, and is also time-consuming, considering
the fact that only experts are capable of providing annotations. Automatic and
semi-automatic tumor segmentation methods have recently shown promising
results. However, as different researchers have validated their algorithms
using various datasets and performance metrics, reliably evaluating these
methods is still an open challenge. The goal of the Lung-Originated Tumor
Segmentation from Computed Tomography Scan (LOTUS) Benchmark created through
2018 IEEE Video and Image Processing (VIP) Cup competition, is to provide a
unique dataset and pre-defined metrics, so that different researchers can
develop and evaluate their methods in a unified fashion. The 2018 VIP Cup
started with a global engagement from 42 countries to access the competition
data. At the registration stage, there were 129 members clustered into 28 teams
from 10 countries, out of which 9 teams made it to the final stage and 6 teams
successfully completed all the required tasks. In a nutshell, all the
algorithms proposed during the competition, are based on deep learning models
combined with a false positive reduction technique. Methods developed by the
three finalists show promising results in tumor segmentation, however, more
effort should be put into reducing the false positive rate. This competition
manuscript presents an overview of the VIP-Cup challenge, along with the
proposed algorithms and results.</span>

                    <span>This paper is concerned with the training of neural networks (NNs) under
semidefinite constraints. This type of training problems has recently gained
popularity since semidefinite constraints can be used to verify interesting
properties for NNs that include, e.g., the estimation of an upper bound on the
Lipschitz constant, which relates to the robustness of an NN, or the stability
of dynamic systems with NN controllers. The utilized semidefinite constraints
are based on sector constraints satisfied by the underlying activation
functions. Unfortunately, one of the biggest bottlenecks of these new results
is the required computational effort for incorporating the semidefinite
constraints into the training of NNs which is limiting their scalability to
large NNs. We address this challenge by developing interior point methods for
NN training that we implement using barrier functions for semidefinite
constraints. In order to efficiently compute the gradients of the barrier
terms, we exploit the structure of the semidefinite constraints. In
experiments, we demonstrate the superior efficiency of our training method over
previous approaches, which allows us, e.g., to use semidefinite constraints in
the training of Wasserstein generative adversarial networks, where the
discriminator must satisfy a Lipschitz condition.</span>

                    <span>Recently, deep reinforcement learning (RL) has proven its feasibility in
solving combinatorial optimization problems (COPs). The learning-to-rank
techniques have been studied in the field of information retrieval. While
several COPs can be formulated as the prioritization of input items, as is
common in the information retrieval, it has not been fully explored how the
learning-to-rank techniques can be incorporated into deep RL for COPs. In this
paper, we present the learning-to-rank distillation-based COP framework, where
a high-performance ranking policy obtained by RL for a COP can be distilled
into a non-iterative, simple model, thereby achieving a low-latency COP solver.
Specifically, we employ the approximated ranking distillation to render a
score-based ranking model learnable via gradient descent. Furthermore, we use
the efficient sequence sampling to improve the inference performance with a
limited delay. With the framework, we demonstrate that a distilled model not
only achieves comparable performance to its respective, high-performance RL,
but also provides several times faster inferences. We evaluate the framework
with several COPs such as priority-based task scheduling and multidimensional
knapsack, demonstrating the benefits of the framework in terms of inference
latency and performance.</span>

                    <span>We study the forecasting problem for traffic with dynamic, possibly
periodical, and joint spatial-temporal dependency between regions. Given the
aggregated inflow and outflow traffic of regions in a city from time slots 0 to
t-1, we predict the traffic at time t at any region. Prior arts in the area
often consider the spatial and temporal dependencies in a decoupled manner or
are rather computationally intensive in training with a large number of
hyper-parameters to tune. We propose ST-TIS, a novel, lightweight, and accurate
Spatial-Temporal Transformer with information fusion and region sampling for
traffic forecasting. ST-TIS extends the canonical Transformer with information
fusion and region sampling. The information fusion module captures the complex
spatial-temporal dependency between regions. The region sampling module is to
improve the efficiency and prediction accuracy, cutting the computation
complexity for dependency learning from $O(n^2)$ to $O(n\sqrt{n})$, where n is
the number of regions. With far fewer parameters than state-of-the-art models,
the offline training of our model is significantly faster in terms of tuning
and computation (with a reduction of up to $90\%$ on training time and network
parameters). Notwithstanding such training efficiency, extensive experiments
show that ST-TIS is substantially more accurate in online prediction than
state-of-the-art approaches (with an average improvement of up to $11\%$ on
RMSE, $14\%$ on MAPE).</span>

                    <span>Machine learning algorithms typically assume that training and test examples
are drawn from the same distribution. However, distribution shift is a common
problem in real-world applications and can cause models to perform dramatically
worse at test time. In this paper, we specifically consider the problems of
domain shifts and subpopulation shifts (eg. imbalanced data). While prior works
often seek to explicitly regularize internal representations and predictors of
the model to be domain invariant, we instead aim to regularize the whole
function without restricting the model&#x27;s internal representations. This leads
to a simple mixup-based technique which learns invariant functions via
selective augmentation called LISA. LISA selectively interpolates samples
either with the same labels but different domains or with the same domain but
different labels. We analyze a linear setting and theoretically show how LISA
leads to a smaller worst-group error. Empirically, we study the effectiveness
of LISA on nine benchmarks ranging from subpopulation shifts to domain shifts,
and we find that LISA consistently outperforms other state-of-the-art methods.</span>

                    <span>Large-scale or high-resolution geologic models usually comprise a huge number
of grid blocks, which can be computationally demanding and time-consuming to
solve with numerical simulators. Therefore, it is advantageous to upscale
geologic models (e.g., hydraulic conductivity) from fine-scale (high-resolution
grids) to coarse-scale systems. Numerical upscaling methods have been proven to
be effective and robust for coarsening geologic models, but their efficiency
remains to be improved. In this work, a deep-learning-based method is proposed
to upscale the fine-scale geologic models, which can assist to improve
upscaling efficiency significantly. In the deep learning method, a deep
convolutional neural network (CNN) is trained to approximate the relationship
between the coarse grid of hydraulic conductivity fields and the hydraulic
heads, which can then be utilized to replace the numerical solvers while
solving the flow equations for each coarse block. In addition, physical laws
(e.g., governing equations and periodic boundary conditions) can also be
incorporated into the training process of the deep CNN model, which is termed
the theory-guided convolutional neural network (TgCNN). With the physical
information considered, dependence on the data volume of training the deep
learning models can be reduced greatly. Several subsurface flow cases are
introduced to test the performance of the proposed deep-learning-based
upscaling method, including 2D and 3D cases, and isotropic and anisotropic
cases. The results show that the deep learning method can provide equivalent
upscaling accuracy to the numerical method, and efficiency can be improved
significantly compared to numerical upscaling.</span>

not enjoyed a complete solution yet. We propose a method for comparing two data
representations. We introduce the Representation Topology Divergence (RTD),
measuring the dissimilarity in multi-scale topology between two point clouds of
equal size with a one-to-one correspondence between points. The data point
clouds are allowed to lie in different ambient spaces. The RTD is one of the
few TDA-based practical methods applicable to real machine learning datasets.
Experiments show that the proposed RTD agrees with the intuitive assessment of
data representation similarity and is sensitive to its topological structure.
We apply RTD to gain insights on neural networks representations in computer
vision and NLP domains for various problems: training dynamics analysis, data
distribution shift, transfer learning, ensemble learning, disentanglement
assessment.</span>

                    <span>Unbalanced optimal transport (UOT) extends optimal transport (OT) to take
into account mass variations to compare distributions. This is crucial to make
OT successful in ML applications, making it robust to data normalization and
outliers. The baseline algorithm is Sinkhorn, but its convergence speed might
be significantly slower for UOT than for OT. In this work, we identify the
cause for this deficiency, namely the lack of a global normalization of the
iterates, which equivalently corresponds to a translation of the dual OT
potentials. Our first contribution leverages this idea to develop a provably
accelerated Sinkhorn algorithm (coined &#x27;translation invariant Sinkhorn&#x27;) for
UOT, bridging the computational gap with OT. Our second contribution focusses
on 1-D UOT and proposes a Frank-Wolfe solver applied to this translation
invariant formulation. The linear oracle of each steps amounts to solving a 1-D
OT problems, resulting in a linear time complexity per iteration. Our last
contribution extends this method to the computation of UOT barycenter of 1-D
measures. Numerical simulations showcase the convergence speed improvement
brought by these three approaches.</span>

                    <span>Embedding methods for product spaces are powerful techniques for
low-distortion and low-dimensional representation of complex data structures.
Here, we address the new problem of linear classification in product space
forms -- products of Euclidean, spherical, and hyperbolic spaces. First, we
describe novel formulations for linear classifiers on a Riemannian manifold
using geodesics and Riemannian metrics which generalize straight lines and
inner products in vector spaces. Second, we prove that linear classifiers in
$d$-dimensional space forms of any curvature have the same expressive power,
i.e., they can shatter exactly $d+1$ points. Third, we formalize linear
classifiers in product space forms, describe the first known perceptron and
support vector machine classifiers for such spaces and establish rigorous
convergence results for perceptrons. Moreover, we prove that the
Vapnik-Chervonenkis dimension of linear classifiers in a product space form of
dimension $d$ is \emph{at least} $d+1$. We support our theoretical findings
with simulations on several datasets, including synthetic data, image data, and
single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data. The results show that
classification in low-dimensional product space forms for scRNA-seq data
offers, on average, a performance improvement of $\sim15\%$ when compared to
that in Euclidean spaces of the same dimension.</span>

exploiting the consensus and/or complementarity among multi-view data. However,
in terms of complementarity, most existing approaches only can find
representations with single complementarity rather than complementary
information with diversity. In this paper, to utilize both complementarity and
consistency simultaneously, give free rein to the potential of deep learning in
grasping diversity-promoting complementarity for multi-view representation
learning, we propose a novel supervised multi-view representation learning
algorithm, called Self-Attention Multi-View network with Diversity-Promoting
Complementarity (SAMVDPC), which exploits the consistency by a group of
encoders, uses self-attention to find complementary information entailing
diversity. Extensive experiments conducted on eight real-world datasets have
demonstrated the effectiveness of our proposed method, and show its superiority
over several baseline methods, which only consider single complementary
information.</span>

                    <span>In sequence-to-sequence learning, e.g., natural language generation, the
decoder relies on the attention mechanism to efficiently extract information
from the encoder. While it is common practice to draw information from only the
last encoder layer, recent work has proposed to use representations from
different encoder layers for diversified levels of information. Nonetheless,
the decoder still obtains only a single view of the source sequences, which
might lead to insufficient training of the encoder layer stack due to the
hierarchy bypassing problem. In this work, we propose layer-wise multi-view
decoding, where for each decoder layer, together with the representations from
the last encoder layer, which serve as a global view, those from other encoder
layers are supplemented for a stereoscopic view of the source sequences.
Systematic experiments and analyses show that we successfully address the
hierarchy bypassing problem, require almost negligible parameter increase, and
substantially improve the performance of sequence-to-sequence learning with
deep representations on five diverse tasks, i.e., machine translation,
abstractive summarization, image captioning, video captioning, and medical
report generation. In particular, our approach achieves new state-of-the-art
results on eight benchmark datasets, including a low-resource machine
translation dataset and two low-resource medical report generation datasets.</span>

                    <span>We outline the general framework of machine learning (ML) methods for
multi-scale dynamical modeling of condensed matter systems, and in particular
of strongly correlated electron models. Complex spatial temporal behaviors in
these systems often arise from the interplay between quasi-particles and the
emergent dynamical classical degrees of freedom, such as local lattice
distortions, spins, and order-parameters. Central to the proposed framework is
the ML energy model that, by successfully emulating the time-consuming
electronic structure calculation, can accurately predict a local energy based
on the classical field in the intermediate neighborhood. In order to properly
include the symmetry of the electron Hamiltonian, a crucial component of the ML
energy model is the descriptor that transforms the neighborhood configuration
into invariant feature variables, which are input to the learning model. A
general theory of the descriptor for the classical fields is formulated, and
two types of models are distinguished depending on the presence or absence of
an internal symmetry for the classical field. Several specific approaches to
the descriptor of the classical fields are presented. Our focus is on the
group-theoretical method that offers a systematic and rigorous approach to
compute invariants based on the bispectrum coefficients. We propose an
efficient implementation of the bispectrum method based on the concept of
reference irreducible representations. Finally, the implementations of the
various descriptors are demonstrated on well-known electronic lattice models.</span>

currently uses, show the formal probabilistic model from which it can be

of view of the predictive capability of the algorithm. We also postulate the
algorithm to be rooted in the formal modelling principle, where the Davidson
model proposed in 1970 seems to be an excellent candidate, preserving the form
of the algorithm currently used. The results indicate that the predictive
capability of the algorithm is notably improved by using the home-field
advantage and the explicit model for the draws in the game. Moderate, but
notable improvement may be attained by introducing the weighting of the results
with the goal differential, which although not rooted in a formal modelling
principle, is compatible with the current algorithm and can be tuned to the
characteristics of the football competition.</span>

                    <span>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have recently emerged as a robust framework for
graph-structured data. They have been applied to many problems such as
knowledge graph analysis, social networks recommendation, and even Covid19
detection and vaccine developments. However, unlike other deep neural networks
such as Feed Forward Neural Networks (FFNNs), few analyses such as verification
and property inferences exist, potentially due to dynamic behaviors of GNNs,
which can take arbitrary graphs as input, whereas FFNNs which only take fixed
size numerical vectors as inputs.

This paper proposes an approach to analyze GNNs by converting them into FFNNs
and reusing existing FFNNs analyses. We discuss various designs to ensure the
scalability and accuracy of the conversions. We illustrate our method on a
study case of node classification. We believe that our approach opens new
research directions for understanding and analyzing GNNs.</span>

                    <span>Multiple medical institutions collaboratively training a model using
federated learning (FL) has become a promising solution for maximizing the
potential of data-driven models, yet the non-independent and identically
distributed (non-iid) data in medical images is still an outstanding challenge
in real-world practice. The feature heterogeneity caused by diverse scanners or
protocols introduces a drift in the learning process, in both local (client)
and global (server) optimizations, which harms the convergence as well as model
performance. Many previous works have attempted to address the non-iid issue by
tackling the drift locally or globally, but how to jointly solve the two
essentially coupled drifts is still unclear. In this work, we concentrate on
handling both local and global drifts and introduce a new harmonizing framework
called HarmoFL. First, we propose to mitigate the local update drift by
normalizing amplitudes of images transformed into the frequency domain to mimic
a unified imaging setting, in order to generate a harmonized feature space
across local clients. Second, based on harmonized features, we design a client
weight perturbation guiding each local model to reach a flat optimum, where a
neighborhood area of the local optimal solution has a uniformly low loss.
Without any extra communication cost, the perturbation assists the global model
to optimize towards a converged optimal solution by aggregating several local
flat optima. We have theoretically analyzed the proposed method and empirically
conducted extensive experiments on three medical image classification and
segmentation tasks, showing that HarmoFL outperforms a set of recent
state-of-the-art methods with promising convergence behavior. Code is available
at https://github.com/med-air/HarmoFL.</span>

                    <span>Deploying various deep learning (DL) models efficiently has boosted the
research on DL compilers. The difficulty of generating optimized tensor codes
drives DL compiler to ask for the auto-tuning approaches, and the increasing
demands require increasing auto-tuning efficiency and quality. Currently, the
DL compilers partition the input DL models into several subgraphs and leverage
the auto-tuning to find the optimal tensor codes of these subgraphs. However,
existing auto-tuning approaches usually regard subgraphs as individual ones and
overlook the similarities across them, and thus fail to exploit better tensor
codes under limited time budgets. We propose FamilySeer, an auto-tuning
framework for DL compilers that can generate better tensor codes even with
limited time budgets. FamilySeer exploits the similarities and differences
among subgraphs can organize them into subgraph families, where the tuning of
one subgraph can also improve other subgraphs within the same family. The cost
model of each family gets more purified training samples generated by the
family and becomes more accurate so that the costly measurements on real
hardware can be replaced with the lightweight estimation through cost model.
Our experiments show that FamilySeer can generate model codes with the same
code performance more efficiently than state-of-the-art auto-tuning frameworks.</span>

                    <span>Latent Gaussian models and boosting are widely used techniques in statistics
and machine learning. Tree-boosting shows excellent prediction accuracy on many
data sets, but potential drawbacks are that it assumes conditional independence
of samples, produces discontinuous predictions for, e.g., spatial data, and it
can have difficulty with high-cardinality categorical variables. Latent
Gaussian models, such as Gaussian process and grouped random effects models,
are flexible prior models which explicitly model dependence among samples and
which allow for efficient learning of predictor functions and for making
probabilistic predictions. However, existing latent Gaussian models usually
assume either a zero or a linear prior mean function which can be an
unrealistic assumption. This article introduces a novel approach that combines
boosting and latent Gaussian models to remedy the above-mentioned drawbacks and
to leverage the advantages of both techniques. We obtain increased prediction
accuracy compared to existing approaches in both simulated and real-world data
experiments.</span>

                    <span>EEG decoding systems based on deep neural networks have been widely used in
decision making of brain computer interfaces (BCI). Their predictions, however,
can be unreliable given the significant variance and noise in EEG signals.
Previous works on EEG analysis mainly focus on the exploration of noise pattern
in the source signal, while the uncertainty during the decoding process is
largely unexplored. Automatically detecting and quantifying such decoding
uncertainty is important for BCI motor imagery applications such as robotic arm
control etc. In this work, we proposed an uncertainty estimation model (UE-EEG)
to explore the uncertainty during the EEG decoding process, which considers
both the uncertainty in the input signal and the uncertainty in the model. The
model utilized dropout oriented method for model uncertainty estimation, and
Bayesian neural network is adopted for modeling the uncertainty of input data.
The model can be integrated into current widely used deep learning classifiers
without change of architecture. We performed extensive experiments for
uncertainty estimation in both intra-subject EEG decoding and cross-subject EEG
decoding on two public motor imagery datasets, where the proposed model
achieves significant improvement on the quality of estimated uncertainty and
demonstrates the proposed UE-EEG is a useful tool for BCI applications.</span>

invasive breast cancer. The mitotic cell count is one of the most common tests
to assess the aggressiveness or grade of breast cancer. In this prognosis,
histopathology images must be examined by a pathologist using high-resolution
microscopes to count the cells. Unfortunately, can be an exhaustive task with
poor reproducibility, especially for non-experts. Deep learning networks have
recently been adapted to medical applications which are able to automatically
localize these regions of interest. However, these region-based networks lack
the ability to take advantage of the segmentation features produced by a full

                    <span>Reconstructing spectral functions from Euclidean Green&#x27;s functions is an
important inverse problem in many-body physics. However, the inversion is
proved to be ill-posed in the realistic systems with noisy Green&#x27;s functions.
In this Letter, we propose an automatic differentiation(AD) framework as a
generic tool for the spectral reconstruction from propagator observable.
Exploiting the neural networks&#x27; regularization as a non-local smoothness
regulator of the spectral function, we represent spectral functions by neural
networks and use the propagator&#x27;s reconstruction error to optimize the network
parameters unsupervisedly. In the training process, except for the
positive-definite form for the spectral function, there are no other explicit
physical priors embedded into the neural networks. The reconstruction
performance is assessed through relative entropy and mean square error for two
different network representations. Compared to the maximum entropy method, the
AD framework achieves better performance in the large-noise situation. It is
noted that the freedom of introducing non-local regularization is an inherent
advantage of the present framework and may lead to substantial improvements in
solving inverse problems.</span>

                    <span>Reinforcement learning agents learn by encouraging behaviours which maximize
their total reward, usually provided by the environment. In many environments,
however, the reward is provided after a series of actions rather than each
single action, leading the agent to experience ambiguity in terms of whether
those actions are effective, an issue known as the credit assignment problem.
In this paper, we propose two strategies inspired by behavioural psychology to
enable the agent to intrinsically estimate more informative reward values for
actions with no reward. The first strategy, called self-punishment (SP),
discourages the agent from making mistakes that lead to undesirable terminal
states. The second strategy, called the rewards backfill (RB), backpropagates
the rewards between two rewarded actions. We prove that, under certain
assumptions and regardless of the reinforcement learning algorithm used, these
two strategies maintain the order of policies in the space of all possible
policies in terms of their total reward, and, by extension, maintain the
optimal policy. Hence, our proposed strategies integrate with any reinforcement
learning algorithm that learns a value or action-value function through
experience. We incorporated these two strategies into three popular deep
reinforcement learning approaches and evaluated the results on thirty Atari
games. After parameter tuning, our results indicate that the proposed
strategies improve the tested methods in over 65 percent of tested games by up
to over 25 times performance improvement.</span>

novelty-characterization, incremental learning, and instance management to
learn new classes from a stream of unlabeled data in an unsupervised manner,
survey how to adapt a few state-of-the-art techniques to fit the framework and
use them to define seven baselines for performance on the open-world learning
without labels problem. We then discuss open-world learning quality and analyze
how that can improve instance management. We also discuss some of the general
ambiguity issues that occur in open-world learning without labels.</span>

                    <span>Spectral embedding of network adjacency matrices often produces node
representations living approximately around low-dimensional submanifold
structures. In particular, hidden substructure is expected to arise when the
graph is generated from a latent position model. Furthermore, the presence of
communities within the network might generate community-specific submanifold
structures in the embedding, but this is not explicitly accounted for in most
statistical models for networks. In this article, a class of models called
latent structure block models (LSBM) is proposed to address such scenarios,
allowing for graph clustering when community-specific one dimensional manifold
structure is present. LSBMs focus on a specific class of latent space model,
the random dot product graph (RDPG), and assign a latent submanifold to the
latent positions of each community. A Bayesian model for the embeddings arising
from LSBMs is discussed, and shown to have a good performance on simulated and
real world network data. The model is able to correctly recover the underlying
communities living in a one-dimensional manifold, even when the parametric form
of the underlying curves is unknown, achieving remarkable results on a variety
of real data.</span>

                    <span>Meta-learning traditionally relies on backpropagation through entire tasks to
iteratively improve a model&#x27;s learning dynamics. However, this approach is
computationally intractable when scaled to complex tasks. We propose a
distributed evolutionary meta-learning strategy using Tensor Processing Units
(TPUs) that is highly parallel and scalable to arbitrarily long tasks with no
increase in memory cost. Using a Prototypical Network trained with evolution
strategies on the Omniglot dataset, we achieved an accuracy of 98.4% on a
5-shot classification problem. Our algorithm used as much as 40 times less
memory than automatic differentiation to compute the gradient, with the
resulting model achieving accuracy within 1.3% of a backpropagation-trained
equivalent (99.6%). We observed better classification accuracy as high as 99.1%
with larger population configurations. We further experimentally validate the
stability and performance of ES-ProtoNet across a variety of training
conditions (varying population size, model size, number of workers, shot, way,
ES hyperparameters, etc.). Our contributions are twofold: we provide the first
assessment of evolutionary meta-learning in a supervised setting, and create a
general framework for distributed evolution strategies on TPUs.</span>

                    <span>Contrastive learning has been widely applied to graph representation
learning, where the view generators play a vital role in generating effective
contrastive samples. Most of the existing contrastive learning methods employ
pre-defined view generation methods, e.g., node drop or edge perturbation,
which usually cannot adapt to input data or preserve the original semantic
structures well. To address this issue, we propose a novel framework named
Automated Graph Contrastive Learning (AutoGCL) in this paper. Specifically,
AutoGCL employs a set of learnable graph view generators orchestrated by an
auto augmentation strategy, where every graph view generator learns a
probability distribution of graphs conditioned by the input. While the graph
view generators in AutoGCL preserve the most representative structures of the
original graph in generation of every contrastive sample, the auto augmentation
learns policies to introduce adequate augmentation variances in the whole
contrastive learning procedure. Furthermore, AutoGCL adopts a joint training
strategy to train the learnable view generators, the graph encoder, and the
classifier in an end-to-end manner, resulting in topological heterogeneity yet
semantic similarity in the generation of contrastive samples. Extensive
experiments on semi-supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and transfer
learning demonstrate the superiority of our AutoGCL framework over the
state-of-the-arts in graph contrastive learning. In addition, the visualization
results further confirm that the learnable view generators can deliver more
compact and semantically meaningful contrastive samples compared against the
existing view generation methods.</span>

                    <span>Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is a notoriously noisy
measurement of brain activity because of the large variations between
individuals, signals marred by environmental differences during collection, and
spatiotemporal averaging required by the measurement resolution. In addition,
the data is extremely high dimensional, with the space of the activity
typically having much lower intrinsic dimension. In order to understand the
connection between stimuli of interest and brain activity, and analyze
differences and commonalities between subjects, it becomes important to learn a
meaningful embedding of the data that denoises, and reveals its intrinsic
structure. Specifically, we assume that while noise varies significantly
between individuals, true responses to stimuli will share common,
low-dimensional features between subjects which are jointly discoverable.
Similar approaches have been exploited previously but they have mainly used
linear methods such as PCA and shared response modeling (SRM). In contrast, we
propose a neural network called MRMD-AE (manifold-regularized multiple decoder,
autoencoder), that learns a common embedding from multiple subjects in an
experiment while retaining the ability to decode to individual raw fMRI
signals. We show that our learned common space represents an extensible
manifold (where new points not seen during training can be mapped), improves
the classification accuracy of stimulus features of unseen timepoints, as well
as improves cross-subject translation of fMRI signals. We believe this
framework can be used for many downstream applications such as guided
brain-computer interface (BCI) training in the future.</span>

variables and arbitrary constraints on the indicators. We show that a convex
hull description of the associated mixed-integer set in an extended space with
a quadratic number of additional variables consists of a single positive
semidefinite constraint (explicitly stated) and linear constraints. In
particular, convexification of this class of problems reduces to describing a
polyhedral set in an extended formulation. We also give descriptions in the
original space of variables: we provide a description based on an infinite
number of conic-quadratic inequalities, which are &quot;finitely generated.&quot; In
particular, it is possible to characterize whether a given inequality is
necessary to describe the convex-hull. The new theory presented here unifies
several previously established results, and paves the way toward utilizing
polyhedral methods to analyze the convex hull of mixed-integer nonlinear sets.</span>

metaheuristics are needed that enhance the capabilities of classical
algorithms. More recently, researchers have been looking at Charles Darwin&#x27;s

approaches using machine learning. In 1960, the first genetic algorithm was

                    <span>Recent natural language processing (NLP) techniques have accomplished high
performance on benchmark datasets, primarily due to the significant improvement
in the performance of deep learning. The advances in the research community
have led to great enhancements in state-of-the-art production systems for NLP
tasks, such as virtual assistants, speech recognition, and sentiment analysis.
However, such NLP systems still often fail when tested with adversarial
attacks. The initial lack of robustness exposed troubling gaps in current
models&#x27; language understanding capabilities, creating problems when NLP systems
are deployed in real life. In this paper, we present a structured overview of
NLP robustness research by summarizing the literature in a systemic way across
various dimensions. We then take a deep-dive into the various dimensions of
robustness, across techniques, metrics, embeddings, and benchmarks. Finally, we
argue that robustness should be multi-dimensional, provide insights into
current research, identify gaps in the literature to suggest directions worth
pursuing to address these gaps.</span>

                    <span>The idea of slicing divergences has been proven to be successful when
comparing two probability measures in various machine learning applications
including generative modeling, and consists in computing the expected value of
a &#x60;base divergence&#x27; between one-dimensional random projections of the two
measures. However, the topological, statistical, and computational consequences
of this technique have not yet been well-established. In this paper, we aim at
bridging this gap and derive various theoretical properties of sliced
probability divergences. First, we show that slicing preserves the metric
axioms and the weak continuity of the divergence, implying that the sliced
divergence will share similar topological properties. We then precise the
results in the case where the base divergence belongs to the class of integral
probability metrics. On the other hand, we establish that, under mild
conditions, the sample complexity of a sliced divergence does not depend on the
problem dimension. We finally apply our general results to several base
divergences, and illustrate our theory on both synthetic and real data
experiments.</span>

                    <span>Anomaly detection aims at identifying deviant instances from the normal data
distribution. Many advances have been made in the field, including the
innovative use of unsupervised contrastive learning. However, existing methods
generally assume clean training data and are limited when the data contain
unknown anomalies. This paper presents Elsa, a novel semi-supervised anomaly
detection approach that unifies the concept of energy-based models with
unsupervised contrastive learning. Elsa instills robustness against any data
contamination by a carefully designed fine-tuning step based on the new energy
function that forces the normal data to be divided into classes of prototypes.
Experiments on multiple contamination scenarios show the proposed model
achieves SOTA performance. Extensive analyses also verify the contribution of
each component in the proposed model. Beyond the experiments, we also offer a
theoretical interpretation of why contrastive learning alone cannot detect
anomalies under data contamination.</span>

over-parameterized so that they can fit the noisy training data exactly, yet
they can still achieve small test errors in practice. In this paper, we study
this &quot;benign overfitting&quot; phenomenon of the maximum margin classifier for
linear classification problems. Specifically, we consider data generated from
sub-Gaussian mixtures, and provide a tight risk bound for the maximum margin
linear classifier in the over-parameterized setting. Our results precisely

                    <span>Many past attempts at modeling repeated Cournot games assume that demand is
stationary. This does not align with real-world scenarios in which market
demands can evolve over a product&#x27;s lifetime for a myriad of reasons. In this
paper, we model repeated Cournot games with non-stationary demand such that
firms/agents face separate instances of non-stationary multi-armed bandit
problem. The set of arms/actions that an agent can choose from represents
discrete production quantities; here, the action space is ordered. Agents are
independent and autonomous, and cannot observe anything from the environment;
they can only see their own rewards after taking an action, and only work
towards maximizing these rewards. We propose a novel algorithm &#x27;Adaptive with
Weighted Exploration (AWE) $\epsilon$-greedy&#x27; which is remotely based on the
well-known $\epsilon$-greedy approach. This algorithm detects and quantifies
changes in rewards due to varying market demand and varies learning rate and
exploration rate in proportion to the degree of changes in demand, thus
enabling agents to better identify new optimal actions. For efficient
exploration, it also deploys a mechanism for weighing actions that takes
advantage of the ordered action space. We use simulations to study the
emergence of various equilibria in the market. In addition, we study the
scalability of our approach in terms number of total agents in the system and
the size of action space. We consider both symmetric and asymmetric firms in
our models. We found that using our proposed method, agents are able to swiftly
change their course of action according to the changes in demand, and they also
engage in collusive behavior in many simulations.</span>

                    <span>As machine learning powered decision making is playing an increasingly
important role in our daily lives, it is imperative to strive for fairness of
the underlying data processing and algorithms. We propose a pre-processing
algorithm for fair data representation via which L2- objective supervised
learning algorithms result in an estimation of the Pareto frontier between
prediction error and statistical disparity. In particular, the present work
applies the optimal positive definite affine transport maps to approach the
post-processing Wasserstein barycenter characterization of the optimal fair
L2-objective supervised learning via a pre-processing data deformation. We call
the resulting data Wasserstein pseudo-barycenter. Furthermore, we show that the
Wasserstein geodesics from the learning outcome marginals to the barycenter
characterizes the Pareto frontier between L2-loss and total Wasserstein
distance among learning outcome marginals. Thereby, an application of McCann
interpolation generalizes the pseudo-barycenter to a family of data
representations via which L2-objective supervised learning algorithms result in
the Pareto frontier. Numerical simulations underscore the advantages of the
proposed data representation: (1) the pre-processing step is compositive with
arbitrary L2-objective supervised learning methods and unseen data; (2) the
fair representation protects data privacy by preventing the training machine
from direct or indirect access to the sensitive information of the data; (3)
the optimal affine map results in efficient computation of fair supervised
learning on high-dimensional data; (4) experimental results shed light on the
fairness of L2-objective unsupervised learning via the proposed fair data
representation.</span>

                    <span>The advent of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) has led to their
application in several domains. One noteworthy application is the perception
system for autonomous driving that relies on the predictions from CNNs.
Practitioners evaluate the generalization ability of such CNNs by calculating
various metrics on an independent test dataset. A test dataset is often chosen
based on only one precondition, i.e., its elements are not a part of the
training data. Such a dataset may contain objects that are both similar and
novel w.r.t. the training dataset. Nevertheless, existing works do not reckon
the novelty of the test samples and treat them all equally for evaluating
generalization. Such novelty-based evaluations are of significance to validate
the fitness of a CNN in autonomous driving applications. Hence, we propose a
CNN generalization scoring framework that considers novelty of objects in the
test dataset. We begin with the representation learning technique to reduce the
image data into a low-dimensional space. It is on this space we estimate the
novelty of the test samples. Finally, we calculate the generalization score as
a combination of the test data prediction performance and novelty. We perform
an experimental study of the same for our traffic light detection application.
In addition, we systematically visualize the results for an interpretable
notion of novelty.</span>

                    <span>It is well-known that deep neural networks (DNNs) have shown remarkable
success in many fields. However, when adding an imperceptible magnitude
perturbation on the model input, the model performance might get rapid
decrease. To address this issue, a randomness technique has been proposed
recently, named Stochastic Neural Networks (SNNs). Specifically, SNNs inject
randomness into the model to defend against unseen attacks and improve the
adversarial robustness. However, existed studies on SNNs mainly focus on
injecting fixed or learnable noises to model weights/activations. In this
paper, we find that the existed SNNs performances are largely bottlenecked by
the feature representation ability. Surprisingly, simply maximizing the
variance per dimension of the feature distribution leads to a considerable
boost beyond all previous methods, which we named maximize feature distribution
variance stochastic neural network (MFDV-SNN). Extensive experiments on
well-known white- and black-box attacks show that MFDV-SNN achieves a
significant improvement over existing methods, which indicates that it is a
simple but effective method to improve model robustness.</span>

                    <span>Stochastic weight averaging (SWA) is recognized as a simple while one
effective approach to improve the generalization of stochastic gradient descent
(SGD) for training deep neural networks (DNNs). A common insight to explain its
success is that averaging weights following an SGD process equipped with
cyclical or high constant learning rates can discover wider optima, which then
lead to better generalization. We give a new insight that does not concur with
the above one. We characterize that SWA&#x27;s performance is highly dependent on to
what extent the SGD process that runs before SWA converges, and the operation
of weight averaging only contributes to variance reduction. This new insight
suggests practical guides on better algorithm design. As an instantiation, we
show that following an SGD process with insufficient convergence, running SWA
more times leads to continual incremental benefits in terms of generalization.
Our findings are corroborated by extensive experiments across different network
architectures, including a baseline CNN, PreResNet-164, WideResNet-28-10,
VGG16, ResNet-50, ResNet-152, DenseNet-161, and different datasets including
CIFAR-{10,100}, and Imagenet.</span>

                    <span>We analyze the best achievable performance of Bayesian learning under
generative models by defining and upper-bounding the minimum excess risk (MER):
the gap between the minimum expected loss attainable by learning from data and
the minimum expected loss that could be achieved if the model realization were
known. The definition of MER provides a principled way to define different
notions of uncertainties in Bayesian learning, including the aleatoric
uncertainty and the minimum epistemic uncertainty. Two methods for deriving
upper bounds for the MER are presented. The first method, generally suitable
for Bayesian learning with a parametric generative model, upper-bounds the MER
by the conditional mutual information between the model parameters and the
quantity being predicted given the observed data. It allows us to quantify the
rate at which the MER decays to zero as more data becomes available. Under
realizable models, this method also relates the MER to the richness of the
generative function class, notably the VC dimension in binary classification.
The second method, particularly suitable for Bayesian learning with a
parametric predictive model, relates the MER to the minimum estimation error of
the model parameters from data. It explicitly shows how the uncertainty in
model parameter estimation translates to the MER and to the final prediction
uncertainty. We also extend the definition and analysis of MER to the setting
with multiple model families and the setting with nonparametric models. Along
the discussions we draw some comparisons between the MER in Bayesian learning
and the excess risk in frequentist learning.</span>

                    <span>Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) are prevalent machine learning models that
have been applied across various real world classification tasks. ANNs require
a large amount of data to have strong out of sample performance, and many
algorithms for training ANN parameters are based on stochastic gradient descent
(SGD). However, the SGD ANNs that tend to perform best on prediction tasks are
trained in an end to end manner that requires a large number of model
parameters and random initialization. This means training ANNs is very time
consuming and the resulting models take a lot of memory to deploy. In order to
train more parsimonious ANN models, we propose the use of alternative methods
from the constrained optimization literature for ANN training and pretraining.
In particular, we propose novel mixed integer programming (MIP) formulations
for training fully-connected ANNs. Our formulations can account for both binary
activation and rectified linear unit (ReLU) activation ANNs, and for the use of
a log likelihood loss. We also develop a layer-wise greedy approach, a
technique adapted for reducing the number of layers in the ANN, for model
pretraining using our MIP formulations. We then present numerical experiments
comparing our MIP based methods against existing SGD based approaches and show
that we are able to achieve models with competitive out of sample performance
that are significantly more parsimonious.</span>

                    <span>Text classification is a fundamental Natural Language Processing task that
has a wide variety of applications, where deep learning approaches have
produced state-of-the-art results. While these models have been heavily
criticized for their black-box nature, their robustness to slight perturbations
in input text has been a matter of concern. In this work, we carry out a
data-focused study evaluating the impact of systematic practical perturbations
on the performance of the deep learning based text classification models like
CNN, LSTM, and BERT-based algorithms. The perturbations are induced by the
addition and removal of unwanted tokens like punctuation and stop-words that
are minimally associated with the final performance of the model. We show that
these deep learning approaches including BERT are sensitive to such legitimate
input perturbations on four standard benchmark datasets SST2, TREC-6, BBC News,
and tweet_eval. We observe that BERT is more susceptible to the removal of
tokens as compared to the addition of tokens. Moreover, LSTM is slightly more
sensitive to input perturbations as compared to CNN based model. The work also
serves as a practical guide to assessing the impact of discrepancies in
train-test conditions on the final performance of models.</span>

                    <span>In the last decades, scene text recognition has gained worldwide attention
from both the academic community and actual users due to its importance in a
wide range of applications. Despite achievements in optical character
recognition, scene text recognition remains challenging due to inherent
problems such as distortions or irregular layout. Most of the existing
approaches mainly leverage recurrence or convolution-based neural networks.
However, while recurrent neural networks (RNNs) usually suffer from slow
training speed due to sequential computation and encounter problems as
vanishing gradient or bottleneck, CNN endures a trade-off between complexity
and performance. In this paper, we introduce SAFL, a self-attention-based
neural network model with the focal loss for scene text recognition, to
overcome the limitation of the existing approaches. The use of focal loss
instead of negative log-likelihood helps the model focus more on low-frequency
samples training. Moreover, to deal with the distortions and irregular texts,
we exploit Spatial TransformerNetwork (STN) to rectify text before passing to
the recognition network. We perform experiments to compare the performance of
the proposed model with seven benchmarks. The numerical results show that our
model achieves the best performance.</span>

                    <span>A support vector machine (SVM) is an algorithm which finds a hyperplane that
optimally separates labeled data points in $\mathbb{R}^n$ into positive and
negative classes. The data points on the margin of this separating hyperplane
are called support vectors. We connect the possible configurations of support
vectors to Radon&#x27;s theorem, which provides guarantees for when a set of points
can be divided into two classes (positive and negative) whose convex hulls
intersect. If the convex hulls of the positive and negative support vectors are
projected onto a separating hyperplane, the projections intersect in at least
one point if and only if the hyperplane is optimal. Further, with a particular
type of general position, we show that (a) the projected convex hulls of the
support vectors intersect in exactly one point, (b) the support vectors are
stable under perturbation, (c) there are at most $n+1$ support vectors, and (d)
every number of support vectors from 2 up to $n+1$ is possible. Finally, we
perform computer simulations studying the expected number of support vectors,
and their configurations, for randomly generated data. We observe that as the
distance between classes of points increases for this type of randomly
generated data, configurations with two support vectors become the most likely
configurations.</span>

                    <span>We study the continuity property of the generalized entropy as a function of
the underlying probability distribution, defined with an action space and a
loss function, and use this property to answer the basic questions in
statistical learning theory: the excess risk analyses for various learning
methods. We first derive upper and lower bounds for the entropy difference of
two distributions in terms of several commonly used f-divergences, the
Wasserstein distance, a distance that depends on the action space and the loss
function, and the Bregman divergence generated by the entropy, which also
induces bounds in terms of the Euclidean distance between the two
distributions. Examples are given along with the discussion of each general
result, comparisons are made with the existing entropy difference bounds, and
new mutual information upper bounds are derived based on the new results. We
then apply the entropy difference bounds to the theory of statistical learning.
It is shown that the excess risks in the two popular learning paradigms, the
frequentist learning and the Bayesian learning, both can be studied with the
continuity property of different forms of the generalized entropy. The analysis
is then extended to the continuity of generalized conditional entropy. The
extension provides performance bounds for Bayes decision making with mismatched
distributions. It also leads to excess risk bounds for a third paradigm of
learning, where the decision rule is optimally designed under the projection of
the empirical distribution to a predefined family of distributions. We thus
establish a unified method of excess risk analysis for the three major
paradigms of statistical learning, through the continuity of generalized
entropy.</span>

                    <span>One major drawback of deep neural networks (DNNs) for use in sensitive
application domains is their black-box nature. This makes it hard to verify or
monitor complex, symbolic requirements. In this work, we present a simple, yet
effective, approach to verify whether a trained convolutional neural network
(CNN) respects specified symbolic background knowledge. The knowledge may
consist of any fuzzy predicate logic rules. For this, we utilize methods from
explainable artificial intelligence (XAI): First, using concept embedding
analysis, the output of a computer vision CNN is post-hoc enriched by concept
outputs; second, logical rules from prior knowledge are fuzzified to serve as
continuous-valued functions on the concept outputs. These can be evaluated with
little computational overhead. We demonstrate three diverse use-cases of our
method on stateof-the-art object detectors: Finding corner cases, utilizing the
rules for detecting and localizing DNN misbehavior during runtime, and
comparing the logical consistency of DNNs. The latter is used to find related
differences between EfficientDet D1 and Mask R-CNN object detectors. We show
that this approach benefits from fuzziness and calibrating the concept outputs.</span>

                    <span>Although it is well known that exploration plays a key role in Reinforcement
Learning (RL), prevailing exploration strategies for continuous control tasks
in RL are mainly based on naive isotropic Gaussian noise regardless of the
causality relationship between action space and the task and consider all
dimensions of actions equally important. In this work, we propose to conduct
interventions on the primal action space to discover the causal relationship
between the action space and the task reward. We propose the method of
State-Wise Action Refined (SWAR), which addresses the issue of action space
redundancy and promote causality discovery in RL. We formulate causality
discovery in RL tasks as a state-dependent action space selection problem and
propose two practical algorithms as solutions. The first approach, TD-SWAR,
detects task-related actions during temporal difference learning, while the
second approach, Dyn-SWAR, reveals important actions through dynamic model
prediction. Empirically, both methods provide approaches to understand the
decisions made by RL agents and improve learning efficiency in action-redundant

services are continuously buying new video content to mine the potential profit
from them. As such, the newly added content has to be handled well to be
recommended to suitable users. In this paper, we address the new item
cold-start problem by exploring the potential of various deep learning features
to provide video recommendations. The deep learning features investigated
include features that capture the visual-appearance, audio and motion
information from video content. We also explore different fusion methods to
evaluate how well these feature modalities can be combined to fully exploit the
complementary information captured by them. Experiments on a real-world video
dataset for movie recommendations show that deep learning features outperform
hand-crafted features. In particular, recommendations generated with deep
learning audio features and action-centric deep learning features are superior
to MFCC and state-of-the-art iDT features. In addition, the combination of
various deep learning features with hand-crafted features and textual metadata
yields significant improvement in recommendations compared to combining only
the former.</span>

                    <span>Reinforcement learning (RL) has drawn increasing interests in recent years
due to its tremendous success in various applications. However, standard RL
algorithms can only be applied for single reward function, and cannot adapt to
an unseen reward function quickly. In this paper, we advocate a general
operator view of reinforcement learning, which enables us to directly
approximate the operator that maps from reward function to value function. The
benefit of learning the operator is that we can incorporate any new reward
function as input and attain its corresponding value function in a zero-shot
manner. To approximate this special type of operator, we design a number of
novel operator neural network architectures based on its theoretical
properties. Our design of operator networks outperform the existing methods and
the standard design of general purpose operator network, and we demonstrate the
benefit of our operator deep Q-learning framework in several tasks including
reward transferring for offline policy evaluation (OPE) and reward transferring
for offline policy optimization in a range of tasks.</span>

                    <span>Vision transformers (ViT) have recently attracted considerable attentions,
but the huge computational cost remains an issue for practical deployment.
Previous ViT pruning methods tend to prune the model along one dimension
solely, which may suffer from excessive reduction and lead to sub-optimal model
quality. In contrast, we advocate a multi-dimensional ViT compression paradigm,
and propose to harness the redundancy reduction from attention head, neuron and
sequence dimensions jointly. We firstly propose a statistical dependence based
pruning criterion that is generalizable to different dimensions for identifying
deleterious components. Moreover, we cast the multi-dimensional compression as
an optimization, learning the optimal pruning policy across the three
dimensions that maximizes the compressed model&#x27;s accuracy under a computational
budget. The problem is solved by our adapted Gaussian process search with
expected improvement. Experimental results show that our method effectively
reduces the computational cost of various ViT models. For example, our method
reduces 40\% FLOPs without top-1 accuracy loss for DeiT and T2T-ViT models,
outperforming previous state-of-the-arts.</span>

                    <span>We examine the ability of machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL)
algorithms to infer surface/ground exchange flux based on subsurface
temperature observations. The observations and fluxes are produced from a
high-resolution numerical model representing conditions in the Columbia River
near the Department of Energy Hanford site located in southeastern Washington
State. Random measurement error, of varying magnitude, is added to the
synthetic temperature observations. The results indicate that both ML and DL
methods can be used to infer the surface/ground exchange flux. DL methods,
especially convolutional neural networks, outperform the ML methods when used
to interpret noisy temperature data with a smoothing filter applied. However,
the ML methods also performed well and they are can better identify a reduced
number of important observations, which could be useful for measurement network
optimization. Surprisingly, the ML and DL methods better inferred upward flux
than downward flux. This is in direct contrast to previous findings using
numerical models to infer flux from temperature observations and it may suggest
that combined use of ML or DL inference with numerical inference could improve
flux estimation beneath river systems.</span>

                    <span>Patent data provides rich information about technical inventions, but does
not disclose the ethnic origin of inventors. In this paper, I use supervised
learning techniques to infer this information. To do so, I construct a dataset
of 95&#x27;202 labeled names and train an artificial recurrent neural network with
long-short-term memory (LSTM) to predict ethnic origins based on names. The
trained network achieves an overall performance of 91% across 17 ethnic
origins. I use this model to classify and investigate the ethnic origins of
2.68 million inventors and provide novel descriptive evidence regarding their
ethnic origin composition over time and across countries and technological
fields. The global ethnic origin composition has become more diverse over the
last decades, which was mostly due to a relative increase of Asian origin
inventors. Furthermore, the prevalence of foreign-origin inventors is
especially high in the USA, but has also increased in other high-income
economies. This increase was mainly driven by an inflow of non-western
inventors into emerging high-technology fields for the USA, but not for other
high-income countries.</span>

                    <span>Detecting and labeling stance in social media text is strongly motivated by
hate speech detection, poll prediction, engagement forecasting, and concerted
propaganda detection. Today&#x27;s best neural stance detectors need large volumes
of training data, which is difficult to curate given the fast-changing
landscape of social media text and issues on which users opine. Homophily
properties over the social network provide strong signal of coarse-grained
user-level stance. But semi-supervised approaches for tweet-level stance
detection fail to properly leverage homophily. In light of this, We present
SANDS, a new semi-supervised stance detector. SANDS starts from very few
labeled tweets. It builds multiple deep feature views of tweets. It also uses a
distant supervision signal from the social network to provide a surrogate loss
signal to the component learners. We prepare two new tweet datasets comprising
over 236,000 politically tinted tweets from two demographics (US and India)
posted by over 87,000 users, their follower-followee graph, and over 8,000
tweets annotated by linguists. SANDS achieves a macro-F1 score of 0.55 (0.49)
on US (India)-based datasets, outperforming 17 baselines (including variants of
SANDS) substantially, particularly for minority stance labels and noisy text.
Numerous ablation experiments on SANDS disentangle the dynamics of textual and
network-propagated stance signals.</span>

                    <span>Unsupervised anomaly detection aims to build models to effectively detect
unseen anomalies by only training on the normal data. Although previous
reconstruction-based methods have made fruitful progress, their generalization
ability is limited due to two critical challenges. First, the training dataset
only contains normal patterns, which limits the model generalization ability.
Second, the feature representations learned by existing models often lack
representativeness which hampers the ability to preserve the diversity of
normal patterns. In this paper, we propose a novel approach called Adaptive
Memory Network with Self-supervised Learning (AMSL) to address these challenges
and enhance the generalization ability in unsupervised anomaly detection. Based
on the convolutional autoencoder structure, AMSL incorporates a self-supervised
learning module to learn general normal patterns and an adaptive memory fusion
module to learn rich feature representations. Experiments on four public
multivariate time series datasets demonstrate that AMSL significantly improves
the performance compared to other state-of-the-art methods. Specifically, on
the largest CAP sleep stage detection dataset with 900 million samples, AMSL
outperforms the second-best baseline by \textbf{4}\%+ in both accuracy and F1
score. Apart from the enhanced generalization ability, AMSL is also more robust
against input noise.</span>

                    <span>Recent years have witnessed the increasing popularity of Location-based
Social Network (LBSN) services, which provides unparalleled opportunities to
build personalized Point-of-Interest (POI) recommender systems. Existing POI
recommendation and location prediction tasks utilize past information for
future recommendation or prediction from a single direction perspective, while
the missing POI category identification task needs to utilize the check-in
information both before and after the missing category. Therefore, a
long-standing challenge is how to effectively identify the missing POI
categories at any time in the real-world check-in data of mobile users. To this
end, in this paper, we propose a novel neural network approach to identify the
missing POI categories by integrating both bi-directional global non-personal
transition patterns and personal preferences of users. Specifically, we
delicately design an attention matching cell to model how well the check-in
category information matches their non-personal transition patterns and
personal preferences. Finally, we evaluate our model on two real-world
datasets, which clearly validate its effectiveness compared with the
state-of-the-art baselines. Furthermore, our model can be naturally extended to
address next POI category recommendation and prediction tasks with competitive
performance.</span>

                    <span>Computing the Bayesian posterior of a neural network is a challenging task
due to the high-dimensionality of the parameter space. Anchored ensembles
approximate the posterior by training an ensemble of neural networks on
anchored losses designed for the optima to follow the Bayesian posterior.
Training an ensemble, however, becomes computationally expensive as its number
of members grows since the full training procedure is repeated for each member.
In this note, we present Sequential Anchored Ensembles (SAE), a lightweight
alternative to anchored ensembles. Instead of training each member of the
ensemble from scratch, the members are trained sequentially on losses sampled
with high auto-correlation, hence enabling fast convergence of the neural
networks and efficient approximation of the Bayesian posterior. SAE outperform
anchored ensembles, for a given computational budget, on some benchmarks while
showing comparable performance on the others and achieved 2nd and 3rd place in
the light and extended tracks of the NeurIPS 2021 Approximate Inference in
Bayesian Deep Learning competition.</span>

systematic review analyzes 240 works published in scholarly journals between
2000 and 2019 that focus on applying Artificial Intelligence (AI), statistical,
and hybrid models to short-term load forecasting (STLF). This work represents
the most comprehensive review of works on this subject to date. A complete
analysis of the literature is conducted to identify the most popular and
accurate techniques as well as existing gaps. The findings show that although
Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) continue to be the most commonly used
standalone technique, researchers have been exceedingly opting for hybrid
combinations of different techniques to leverage the combined advantages of
individual methods. The review demonstrates that it is commonly possible with
these hybrid combinations to achieve prediction accuracy exceeding 99%. The
most successful duration for short-term forecasting has been identified as
prediction for a duration of one day at an hourly interval. The review has

Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) algorithm. It is an example of one of
the most popular paradigms of Deep Reinforcement Learning (DeepRL) for tackling
continuous action spaces: the actor-critic paradigm. In the setting considered
herein, each agent observes a part of the global state space in order to take
local actions, for which it receives local rewards. For every agent, DDPG
trains a local actor (policy) and a local critic (Q-function). The analysis
shows that multi-agent DDPG using neural networks to approximate the local
policies and critics converge to limits with the following properties: The
critic limits minimize the average squared Bellman loss; the actor limits
parameterize a policy that maximizes the local critic&#x27;s approximation of
$Q_i^*$, where $i$ is the agent index. The averaging is with respect to a
probability distribution over the global state-action space. It captures the
asymptotics of all local training processes. Finally, we extend the analysis to
a fully decentralized setting where agents communicate over a wireless network
prone to delays and losses; a typical scenario in, e.g., robotic applications.</span>

                    <span>Graph kernels are historically the most widely-used technique for graph
classification tasks. However, these methods suffer from limited performance
because of the hand-crafted combinatorial features of graphs. In recent years,
graph neural networks (GNNs) have become the state-of-the-art method in
downstream graph-related tasks due to their superior performance. Most GNNs are
based on Message Passing Neural Network (MPNN) frameworks. However, recent
studies show that MPNNs can not exceed the power of the Weisfeiler-Lehman (WL)
algorithm in graph isomorphism test. To address the limitations of existing
graph kernel and GNN methods, in this paper, we propose a novel GNN framework,
termed \textit{Kernel Graph Neural Networks} (KerGNNs), which integrates graph
kernels into the message passing process of GNNs. Inspired by convolution
filters in convolutional neural networks (CNNs), KerGNNs adopt trainable hidden
graphs as graph filters which are combined with subgraphs to update node
embeddings using graph kernels. In addition, we show that MPNNs can be viewed
as special cases of KerGNNs. We apply KerGNNs to multiple graph-related tasks
and use cross-validation to make fair comparisons with benchmarks. We show that
our method achieves competitive performance compared with existing
state-of-the-art methods, demonstrating the potential to increase the
representation ability of GNNs. We also show that the trained graph filters in
KerGNNs can reveal the local graph structures of the dataset, which
significantly improves the model interpretability compared with conventional
GNN models.</span>

                    <span>A key challenge for AI is to build embodied systems that operate in
dynamically changing environments. Such systems must adapt to changing task
contexts and learn continuously. Although standard deep learning systems
achieve state of the art results on static benchmarks, they often struggle in
dynamic scenarios. In these settings, error signals from multiple contexts can
interfere with one another, ultimately leading to a phenomenon known as
catastrophic forgetting. In this article we investigate biologically inspired
architectures as solutions to these problems. Specifically, we show that the
biophysical properties of dendrites and local inhibitory systems enable
networks to dynamically restrict and route information in a context-specific
manner. Our key contributions are as follows. First, we propose a novel
artificial neural network architecture that incorporates active dendrites and
sparse representations into the standard deep learning framework. Next, we
study the performance of this architecture on two separate benchmarks requiring
task-based adaptation: Meta-World, a multi-task reinforcement learning
environment where a robotic agent must learn to solve a variety of manipulation
tasks simultaneously; and a continual learning benchmark in which the model&#x27;s
prediction task changes throughout training. Analysis on both benchmarks
demonstrates the emergence of overlapping but distinct and sparse subnetworks,
allowing the system to fluidly learn multiple tasks with minimal forgetting.
Our neural implementation marks the first time a single architecture has
achieved competitive results on both multi-task and continual learning
settings. Our research sheds light on how biological properties of neurons can
inform deep learning systems to address dynamic scenarios that are typically
impossible for traditional ANNs to solve.</span>

                    <span>Deep neural networks are parametrized by several thousands or millions of
parameters, and have shown tremendous success in many classification problems.
However, the large number of parameters makes it difficult to integrate these
models into edge devices such as smartphones and wearable devices. To address
this problem, knowledge distillation (KD) has been widely employed, that uses a
pre-trained high capacity network to train a much smaller network, suitable for
edge devices. In this paper, for the first time, we study the applicability and
challenges of using KD for time-series data for wearable devices. Successful
application of KD requires specific choices of data augmentation methods during
training. However, it is not yet known if there exists a coherent strategy for
choosing an augmentation approach during KD. In this paper, we report the
results of a detailed study that compares and contrasts various common choices
and some hybrid data augmentation strategies in KD based human activity
analysis. Research in this area is often limited as there are not many
comprehensive databases available in the public domain from wearable devices.
Our study considers databases from small scale publicly available to one
derived from a large scale interventional study into human activity and
sedentary behavior. We find that the choice of data augmentation techniques
during KD have a variable level of impact on end performance, and find that the
optimal network choice as well as data augmentation strategies are specific to
a dataset at hand. However, we also conclude with a general set of
recommendations that can provide a strong baseline performance across
databases.</span>

                    <span>Air pollution monitoring platforms play a very important role in preventing
and mitigating the effects of pollution. Recent advances in the field of graph
signal processing have made it possible to describe and analyze air pollution
monitoring networks using graphs. One of the main applications is the
reconstruction of the measured signal in a graph using a subset of sensors.
Reconstructing the signal using information from sensor neighbors can help
improve the quality of network data, examples are filling in missing data with
correlated neighboring nodes, or correcting a drifting sensor with neighboring
sensors that are more accurate. This paper compares the use of various types of
graph signal reconstruction methods applied to real data sets of Spanish air
pollution reference stations. The methods considered are Laplacian
interpolation, graph signal processing low-pass based graph signal
reconstruction, and kernel-based graph signal reconstruction, and are compared
on actual air pollution data sets measuring O3, NO2, and PM10. The ability of
the methods to reconstruct the signal of a pollutant is shown, as well as the
computational cost of this reconstruction. The results indicate the superiority
of methods based on kernel-based graph signal reconstruction, as well as the
difficulties of the methods to scale in an air pollution monitoring network
with a large number of low-cost sensors. However, we show that scalability can
be overcome with simple methods, such as partitioning the network using a
clustering algorithm.</span>

                    <span>This paper proposes an efficient federated distillation learning system
(EFDLS) for multi-task time series classification (TSC). EFDLS consists of a
central server and multiple mobile users, where different users may run
different TSC tasks. EFDLS has two novel components, namely a feature-based
student-teacher (FBST) framework and a distance-based weights matching (DBWM)
scheme. Within each user, the FBST framework transfers knowledge from its
teacher&#x27;s hidden layers to its student&#x27;s hidden layers via knowledge
distillation, with the teacher and student having identical network structure.
For each connected user, its student model&#x27;s hidden layers&#x27; weights are
uploaded to the EFDLS server periodically. The DBWM scheme is deployed on the
server, with the least square distance used to measure the similarity between
the weights of two given models. This scheme finds a partner for each connected
user such that the user&#x27;s and its partner&#x27;s weights are the closest among all
the weights uploaded. The server exchanges and sends back the user&#x27;s and its
partner&#x27;s weights to these two users which then load the received weights to
their teachers&#x27; hidden layers. Experimental results show that the proposed
EFDLS achieves excellent performance on a set of selected UCR2018 datasets
regarding top-1 accuracy.</span>

                    <span>Event analysis from news and social networks is very useful for a wide range
of social studies and real-world applications. Recently, event graphs have been
explored to model event datasets and their complex relationships, where events
are vertices connected to other vertices representing locations, people&#x27;s
names, dates, and various other event metadata. Graph representation learning
methods are promising for extracting latent features from event graphs to
enable the use of different classification algorithms. However, existing
methods fail to meet essential requirements for event graphs, such as (i)
dealing with semi-supervised graph embedding to take advantage of some labeled
events, (ii) automatically determining the importance of the relationships
between event vertices and their metadata vertices, as well as (iii) dealing
with the graph heterogeneity. This paper presents GNEE (GAT Neural Event
Embeddings), a method that combines Graph Attention Networks and Graph
Regularization. First, an event graph regularization is proposed to ensure that
all graph vertices receive event features, thereby mitigating the graph
heterogeneity drawback. Second, semi-supervised graph embedding with
self-attention mechanism considers existing labeled events, as well as learns
the importance of relationships in the event graph during the representation
learning process. A statistical analysis of experimental results with five
real-world event graphs and six graph embedding methods shows that our GNEE
outperforms state-of-the-art semi-supervised graph embedding methods.</span>

measure the contribution of heatmaps/saliency maps to the classification

potentially serves as a novel indicator for the correctness of deep neural

generate saliency maps capable of attaining high CO scores. Using GAX, we also
qualitatively demonstrate the unintuitiveness of DNN architectures.</span>

opening exciting opportunities for improving pharmacovigilance activities
currently burdened by the ever growing volumes of real world data. To fully
realize these opportunities, existing regulatory guidance and industry best
practices should be taken into consideration in order to increase the overall
trustworthiness of the system and enable broader adoption. In this paper we
present a case study on how to operationalize existing guidance for validated
AI systems in pharmacovigilance focusing on the specific task of medical
literature monitoring (MLM) of adverse events from the scientific literature.
We describe an AI system designed with the goal of reducing effort in MLM
activities built in close collaboration with subject matter experts and
considering guidance for validated systems in pharmacovigilance and AI
transparency. In particular we make use of public disclosures as a useful risk
control measure to mitigate system misuse and earn user trust. In addition we
present experimental results showing the system can significantly remove
screening effort while maintaining high levels of recall (filtering 55% of
irrelevant articles on average, for a target recall of 0.99 on suspected
adverse articles) and provide a robust method for tuning the desired recall to
suit a particular risk profile.</span>

                    <span>Hospital length of stay (LOS) is one of the most essential healthcare metrics
that reflects the hospital quality of service and helps improve hospital
scheduling and management. LOS prediction helps in cost management because
patients who remain in hospitals usually do so in hospital units where
resources are severely limited. In this study, we reviewed papers on LOS
prediction using machine learning and statistical approaches. Our literature
review considers research studies that focus on LOS prediction for stroke
patients. Some of the surveyed studies revealed that authors reached
contradicting conclusions. For example, the age of the patient was considered
an important predictor of LOS for stroke patients in some studies, while other
studies concluded that age was not a significant factor. Therefore, additional
research is required in this domain to further understand the predictors of LOS
for stroke patients.</span>

                    <span>Neural machine translation (NMT) systems aim to map text from one language
into another. While there are a wide variety of applications of NMT, one of the
most important is translation of natural language. A distinguishing factor of
natural language is that words are typically ordered according to the rules of
the grammar of a given language. Although many advances have been made in
developing NMT systems for translating natural language, little research has
been done on understanding how the word ordering of and lexical similarity
between the source and target language affect translation performance. Here, we
investigate these relationships on a variety of low-resource language pairs
from the OpenSubtitles2016 database, where the source language is English, and
find that the more similar the target language is to English, the greater the
translation performance. In addition, we study the impact of providing NMT
models with part of speech of words (POS) in the English sequence and find
that, for Transformer-based models, the more dissimilar the target language is
from English, the greater the benefit provided by POS.</span>

                    <span>We aim to provably complete a sparse and highly-missing tensor in the
presence of covariate information along tensor modes. Our motivation comes from
online advertising where users click-through-rates (CTR) on ads over various
devices form a CTR tensor that has about 96% missing entries and has many zeros
on non-missing entries, which makes the standalone tensor completion method
unsatisfactory. Beside the CTR tensor, additional ad features or user
characteristics are often available. In this paper, we propose
Covariate-assisted Sparse Tensor Completion (COSTCO) to incorporate covariate
information for the recovery of the sparse tensor. The key idea is to jointly
extract latent components from both the tensor and the covariate matrix to
learn a synthetic representation. Theoretically, we derive the error bound for
the recovered tensor components and explicitly quantify the improvements on
both the reveal probability condition and the tensor recovery accuracy due to
covariates. Finally, we apply COSTCO to an advertisement dataset consisting of
a CTR tensor and ad covariate matrix, leading to 23% accuracy improvement over
the baseline. An important by-product is that ad latent components from COSTCO
reveal interesting ad clusters, which are useful for better ad targeting.</span>

                    <span>In recent years, a variety of gradient-based methods have been developed to
solve Bi-Level Optimization (BLO) problems in machine learning and computer
vision areas. However, the theoretical correctness and practical effectiveness
of these existing approaches always rely on some restrictive conditions (e.g.,
Lower-Level Singleton, LLS), which could hardly be satisfied in real-world
applications. Moreover, previous literature only proves theoretical results
based on their specific iteration strategies, thus lack a general recipe to
uniformly analyze the convergence behaviors of different gradient-based BLOs.
In this work, we formulate BLOs from an optimistic bi-level viewpoint and
establish a new gradient-based algorithmic framework, named Bi-level Descent
Aggregation (BDA), to partially address the above issues. Specifically, BDA
provides a modularized structure to hierarchically aggregate both the upper-
and lower-level subproblems to generate our bi-level iterative dynamics.
Theoretically, we establish a general convergence analysis template and derive
a new proof recipe to investigate the essential theoretical properties of
gradient-based BLO methods. Furthermore, this work systematically explores the
convergence behavior of BDA in different optimization scenarios, i.e.,
considering various solution qualities (i.e., global/local/stationary solution)
returned from solving approximation subproblems. Extensive experiments justify
our theoretical results and demonstrate the superiority of the proposed
algorithm for hyper-parameter optimization and meta-learning tasks. Source code

                    <span>While neural networks have shown remarkable success on classification tasks
in terms of average-case performance, they often fail to perform well on
certain groups of the data. Such group information may be expensive to obtain;
thus, recent works in robustness and fairness have proposed ways to improve
worst-group performance even when group labels are unavailable for the training
data. However, these methods generally underperform methods that utilize group
information at training time. In this work, we assume access to a small number
of group labels alongside a larger dataset without group labels. We propose
BARACK, a simple two-step framework to utilize this partial group information
to improve worst-group performance: train a model to predict the missing group
labels for the training data, and then use these predicted group labels in a
robust optimization objective. Theoretically, we provide generalization bounds
for our approach in terms of the worst-group performance, showing how the
generalization error scales with respect to both the total number of training
points and the number of training points with group labels. Empirically, our
method outperforms the baselines that do not use group information, even when
only 1-33% of points have group labels. We provide ablation studies to support
the robustness and extensibility of our framework.</span>

                    <span>A common challenge in large-scale supervised learning, is how to exploit new
incremental data to a pre-trained model, without re-training the model from
scratch. Motivated by this problem, we revisit the canonical problem of dynamic
least-squares regression (LSR), where the goal is to learn a linear model over
incremental training data. In this setup, data and labels $(\mathbf{A}^{(t)},
\mathbf{b}^{(t)}) \in \mathbb{R}^{t \times d}\times \mathbb{R}^t$ evolve in an
online fashion ($t\gg d$), and the goal is to efficiently maintain an
(approximate) solution to $\min_{\mathbf{x}^{(t)}} \| \mathbf{A}^{(t)}
\mathbf{x}^{(t)} - \mathbf{b}^{(t)} \|_2$ for all $t\in [T]$. Our main result
is a dynamic data structure which maintains an arbitrarily small constant
approximate solution to dynamic LSR with amortized update time $O(d^{1+o(1)})$,
almost matching the running time of the static (sketching-based) solution. By
contrast, for exact (or even $1/\mathrm{poly}(n)$-accuracy) solutions, we show
a separation between the static and dynamic settings, namely, that dynamic LSR
requires $\Omega(d^{2-o(1)})$ amortized update time under the OMv Conjecture
(Henzinger et al., STOC&#x27;15). Our data structure is conceptually simple, easy to
implement, and fast both in theory and practice, as corroborated by experiments
over both synthetic and real-world datasets.</span>

generated samples often relies on human evaluation, which is subjective and
costly. We focus on designing a homogeneous, objective framework for evaluating
samples of algorithmically generated music. Any engineered measures to evaluate
generated music typically attempt to define the samples&#x27; musicality, but do not
capture qualities of music such as theme or mood. We do not seek to assess the
musical merit of generated music, but instead explore whether generated samples
contain meaningful information pertaining to emotion or mood/theme. We achieve
this by measuring the change in predictive performance of a music mood/theme
classifier after augmenting its training data with generated samples. We
analyse music samples generated by three models -- SampleRNN, Jukebox, and DDSP
-- and employ a homogeneous framework across all methods to allow for objective
comparison. This is the first attempt at augmenting a music genre
classification dataset with conditionally generated music. We investigate the
classification performance improvement using deep music generation and the
ability of the generators to make emotional music by using an additional,
emotion annotation of the dataset. Finally, we use a classifier trained on real

                    <span>Multi-view learning can cover all features of data samples more
comprehensively, so multi-view learning has attracted widespread attention.
Traditional subspace clustering methods, such as sparse subspace clustering
(SSC) and low-ranking subspace clustering (LRSC), cluster the affinity matrix
for a single view, thus ignoring the problem of fusion between views. In our
article, we propose a new Multiview Subspace Adaptive Learning based on
Attention and Autoencoder (MSALAA). This method combines a deep autoencoder and
a method for aligning the self-representations of various views in Multi-view
Low-Rank Sparse Subspace Clustering (MLRSSC), which can not only increase the
capability to non-linearity fitting, but also can meets the principles of
consistency and complementarity of multi-view learning. We empirically observe
significant improvement over existing baseline methods on six real-life
datasets.</span>

                    <span>Finding concepts in large clinical ontologies can be challenging when queries
use different vocabularies. A search algorithm that overcomes this problem is
useful in applications such as concept normalisation and ontology matching,
where concepts can be referred to in different ways, using different synonyms.
In this paper, we present a deep learning based approach to build a semantic
search system for large clinical ontologies. We propose a Triplet-BERT model
and a method that generates training data directly from the ontologies. The
model is evaluated using five real benchmark data sets and the results show
that our approach achieves high results on both free text to concept and
concept to concept searching tasks, and outperforms all baseline methods.</span>

                    <span>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have shown their great ability in modeling graph
structured data. However, real-world graphs usually contain structure noises
and have limited labeled nodes. The performance of GNNs would drop
significantly when trained on such graphs, which hinders the adoption of GNNs
on many applications. Thus, it is important to develop noise-resistant GNNs
with limited labeled nodes. However, the work on this is rather limited.
Therefore, we study a novel problem of developing robust GNNs on noisy graphs
with limited labeled nodes. Our analysis shows that both the noisy edges and
limited labeled nodes could harm the message-passing mechanism of GNNs. To
mitigate these issues, we propose a novel framework which adopts the noisy
edges as supervision to learn a denoised and dense graph, which can down-weight
or eliminate noisy edges and facilitate message passing of GNNs to alleviate
the issue of limited labeled nodes. The generated edges are further used to
regularize the predictions of unlabeled nodes with label smoothness to better
train GNNs. Experimental results on real-world datasets demonstrate the
robustness of the proposed framework on noisy graphs with limited labeled
nodes.</span>

                    <span>The dynamic job-shop scheduling problem (DJSP) is a class of scheduling tasks
that specifically consider the inherent uncertainties such as changing order
requirements and possible machine breakdown in realistic smart manufacturing
settings. Since traditional methods cannot dynamically generate effective
scheduling strategies in face of the disturbance of environments, we formulate
the DJSP as a Markov decision process (MDP) to be tackled by reinforcement
learning (RL). For this purpose, we propose a flexible hybrid framework that
takes disjunctive graphs as states and a set of general dispatching rules as
the action space with minimum prior domain knowledge. The attention mechanism
is used as the graph representation learning (GRL) module for the feature
extraction of states, and the double dueling deep Q-network with prioritized
replay and noisy networks (D3QPN) is employed to map each state to the most
appropriate dispatching rule. Furthermore, we present Gymjsp, a public
benchmark based on the well-known OR-Library, to provide a standardized
off-the-shelf facility for RL and DJSP research communities. Comprehensive
experiments on various DJSP instances confirm that our proposed framework is
superior to baseline algorithms with smaller makespan across all instances and
provide empirical justification for the validity of the various components in
the hybrid framework.</span>

                    <span>There is a general trend of applying reinforcement learning (RL) techniques
for traffic signal control (TSC). Recently, most studies pay attention to the
neural network design and rarely concentrate on the state representation. Does
the design of state representation has a good impact on TSC? In this paper, we
(1) propose an effective state representation as queue length of vehicles with
intensive knowledge; (2) present a TSC method called MaxQueue based on our
state representation approach; (3) develop a general RL-based TSC template
called QL-XLight with queue length as state and reward and generate QL-FRAP,
QL-CoLight, and QL-DQN by our QL-XLight template based on traditional and
latest RL models.Through comprehensive experiments on multiple real-world
datasets, we demonstrate that: (1) our MaxQueue method outperforms the latest
RL based methods; (2) QL-FRAP and QL-CoLight achieves a new state-of-the-art
(SOTA). In general, state representation with intensive knowledge is also
essential for TSC methods. Our code is released on Github.</span>

                    <span>Outlier detection refers to the identification of data points that deviate
from a general data distribution. Existing unsupervised approaches often suffer
from high computational cost, complex hyperparameter tuning, and limited
interpretability, especially when working with large, high-dimensional
datasets. To address these issues, we present a simple yet effective algorithm
called ECOD (Empirical-Cumulative-distribution-based Outlier Detection), which
is inspired by the fact that outliers are often the &quot;rare events&quot; that appear
in the tails of a distribution. In a nutshell, ECOD first estimates the
underlying distribution of the input data in a nonparametric fashion by
computing the empirical cumulative distribution per dimension of the data. ECOD
then uses these empirical distributions to estimate tail probabilities per
dimension for each data point. Finally, ECOD computes an outlier score of each
data point by aggregating estimated tail probabilities across dimensions. Our
contributions are as follows: (1) we propose a novel outlier detection method
called ECOD, which is both parameter-free and easy to interpret; (2) we perform
extensive experiments on 30 benchmark datasets, where we find that ECOD
outperforms 11 state-of-the-art baselines in terms of accuracy, efficiency, and
scalability; and (3) we release an easy-to-use and scalable (with distributed
support) Python implementation for accessibility and reproducibility.</span>

                    <span>Bayesian optimization (BO) is a framework for global optimization of
expensive-to-evaluate objective functions. Classical BO methods assume that the
objective function is a black box. However, internal information about
objective function computation is often available. For example, when optimizing
a manufacturing line&#x27;s throughput with simulation, we observe the number of
parts waiting at each workstation, in addition to the overall throughput.
Recent BO methods leverage such internal information to dramatically improve
performance. We call these &quot;grey-box&quot; BO methods because they treat objective
computation as partially observable and even modifiable, blending the black-box
approach with so-called &quot;white-box&quot; first-principles knowledge of objective
function computation. This tutorial describes these methods, focusing on BO of
composite objective functions, where one can observe and selectively evaluate
individual constituents that feed into the overall objective; and
multi-fidelity BO, where one can evaluate cheaper approximations of the
objective function by varying parameters of the evaluation oracle.</span>

                    <span>Heat transfer characteristics of nanofluids have been extensively studied
since the 1990s. Research investigations show that the suspended nanoparticles
significantly alter the suspension&#x27;s thermal properties. The thermal
conductivity of nanofluids is one of the properties that is generally found to
be greater than that of the base fluid. This increase in thermal conductivity
is found to depend on several parameters. Several theories have been proposed
to model the thermal conductivities of nanofluids, but there is no reliable
universal theory yet to model the anomalous thermal conductivity of nanofluids.
In recent years, supervised data-driven methods have been successfully employed
to create surrogate models across various scientific disciplines, especially
for modeling difficult-to-understand phenomena. These supervised learning
methods allow the models to capture highly non-linear phenomena. In this work,
we have taken advantage of existing correlations and used them concurrently
with available experimental results to develop more robust surrogate models for
predicting the thermal conductivity of nanofluids. Artificial neural networks
are trained using the transfer learning approach to predict the thermal
conductivity enhancement of nanofluids with spherical particles for 32
different particle-fluid combinations (8 particles materials and 4 fluids). The
large amount of lower accuracy data generated from correlations is used to
coarse-tune the model parameters, and the limited amount of more trustworthy
experimental data is used to fine-tune the model parameters. The transfer
learning-based models&#x27; results are compared with those from baseline models
which are trained only on experimental data using a goodness of fit metric. It
is found that the transfer learning models perform better with goodness of fit
values of 0.93 as opposed to 0.83 from the baseline models.</span>

                    <span>Log anomaly detection is a key component in the field of artificial
intelligence for IT operations (AIOps). Considering log data of variant
domains, retraining the whole network for unknown domains is inefficient in
real industrial scenarios especially for low-resource domains. However,
previous deep models merely focused on extracting the semantics of log sequence
in the same domain, leading to poor generalization on multi-domain logs.
Therefore, we propose a unified Transformer-based framework for log anomaly
detection (\ourmethod{}), which is comprised of the pretraining and
adapter-based tuning stage. Our model is first pretrained on the source domain
to obtain shared semantic knowledge of log data. Then, we transfer the
pretrained model to the target domain via the adapter-based tuning. The
proposed method is evaluated on three public datasets including one source
domain and two target domains. The experimental results demonstrate that our
simple yet efficient approach, with fewer trainable parameters and lower
training costs in the target domain, achieves state-of-the-art performance on
three benchmarks.</span>

                    <span>Most semi-supervised learning methods over-sample labeled data when
constructing training mini-batches. This paper studies whether this common
practice improves learning and how. We compare it to an alternative setting
where each mini-batch is uniformly sampled from all the training data, labeled
or not, which greatly reduces direct supervision from true labels in typical
low-label regimes. However, this simpler setting can also be seen as more
general and even necessary in multi-task problems where over-sampling labeled
data would become intractable. Our experiments on semi-supervised CIFAR-10
image classification using FixMatch show a performance drop when using the
uniform sampling approach which diminishes when the amount of labeled data or
the training time increases. Further, we analyse the training dynamics to
understand how over-sampling of labeled data compares to uniform sampling. Our
main finding is that over-sampling is especially beneficial early in training
but gets less important in the later stages when more pseudo-labels become
correct. Nevertheless, we also find that keeping some true labels remains
important to avoid the accumulation of confirmation errors from incorrect
pseudo-labels.</span>

training and testing. In this paper, we introduce a simple variational
objective whose optima are exactly the set of all representations on which risk
minimizers are guaranteed to be robust to any distribution shift that preserves
the Bayes predictor, e.g., covariate shifts. Our objective has two components.
First, a representation must remain discriminative for the task, i.e., some
predictor must be able to simultaneously minimize the source and target risk.
Second, the representation&#x27;s marginal support needs to be the same across
source and target. We make this practical by designing self-supervised learning
methods that only use unlabelled data and augmentations to train robust
representations. Our objectives achieve state-of-the-art results on DomainBed,
and give insights into the robustness of recent methods, such as CLIP.</span>

                    <span>Many existing region-of-attraction (ROA) analysis tools find difficulty in
addressing feedback systems with large-scale neural network (NN) policies
and/or high-dimensional sensing modalities such as cameras. In this paper, we
tailor the projected gradient descent (PGD) attack method developed in the
adversarial learning community as a general-purpose ROA analysis tool for
large-scale nonlinear systems and end-to-end perception-based control. We show
that the ROA analysis can be approximated as a constrained maximization problem
whose goal is to find the worst-case initial condition which shifts the
terminal state the most. Then we present two PGD-based iterative methods which
can be used to solve the resultant constrained maximization problem. Our
analysis is not based on Lyapunov theory, and hence requires minimum
information of the problem structures. In the model-based setting, we show that
the PGD updates can be efficiently performed using back-propagation. In the
model-free setting (which is more relevant to ROA analysis of perception-based
control), we propose a finite-difference PGD estimate which is general and only
requires a black-box simulator for generating the trajectories of the
closed-loop system given any initial state. We demonstrate the scalability and
generality of our analysis tool on several numerical examples with large-scale
NN policies and high-dimensional image observations. We believe that our
proposed analysis serves as a meaningful initial step toward further
understanding of closed-loop stability of large-scale nonlinear systems and
perception-based control.</span>

                    <span>We consider large-scale Markov decision processes (MDPs) with an unknown cost
function and employ stochastic convex optimization tools to address the problem
of imitation learning, which consists of learning a policy from a finite set of
expert demonstrations.

We adopt the apprenticeship learning formalism, which carries the assumption
that the true cost function can be represented as a linear combination of some
known features. Existing inverse reinforcement learning algorithms come with
strong theoretical guarantees, but are computationally expensive because they
use reinforcement learning or planning algorithms as a subroutine. On the other
hand, state-of-the-art policy gradient based algorithms (like IM-REINFORCE,
IM-TRPO, and GAIL), achieve significant empirical success in challenging
benchmark tasks, but are not well understood in terms of theory. With an
emphasis on non-asymptotic guarantees of performance, we propose a method that
directly learns a policy from expert demonstrations, bypassing the intermediate
step of learning the cost function, by formulating the problem as a single
convex optimization problem over occupancy measures. We develop a
computationally efficient algorithm and derive high confidence regret bounds on
the quality of the extracted policy, utilizing results from stochastic convex
optimization and recent works in approximate linear programming for solving
forward MDPs.</span>

                    <span>Learning operators between infinitely dimensional spaces is an important
learning task arising in wide applications in machine learning, imaging
science, mathematical modeling and simulations, etc. This paper studies the
nonparametric estimation of Lipschitz operators using deep neural networks.
Non-asymptotic upper bounds are derived for the generalization error of the
empirical risk minimizer over a properly chosen network class. Under the
assumption that the target operator exhibits a low dimensional structure, our
error bounds decay as the training sample size increases, with an attractive
fast rate depending on the intrinsic dimension in our estimation. Our
assumptions cover most scenarios in real applications and our results give rise
to fast rates by exploiting low dimensional structures of data in operator
estimation. We also investigate the influence of network structures (e.g.,
network width, depth, and sparsity) on the generalization error of the neural
network estimator and propose a general suggestion on the choice of network
structures to maximize the learning efficiency quantitatively.</span>

                    <span>The crafting of machine learning (ML) based systems requires statistical
control throughout its life cycle. Careful quantification of business
requirements and identification of key factors that impact the business
requirements reduces the risk of a project failure. The quantification of
business requirements results in the definition of random variables
representing the system key performance indicators that need to be analyzed
through statistical experiments. In addition, available data for training and
experiment results impact the design of the system. Once the system is
developed, it is tested and continually monitored to ensure it meets its
business requirements. This is done through the continued application of
statistical experiments to analyze and control the key performance indicators.
This book teaches the art of crafting and developing ML based systems. It
advocates an &quot;experiment first&quot; approach stressing the need to define
statistical experiments from the beginning of the project life cycle. It also
discusses in detail how to apply statistical control on the ML based system
throughout its lifecycle.</span>

                    <span>Emerging edge applications require both a fast response latency and complex
processing. This is infeasible without expensive hardware that can process
complex operations -- such as object detection -- within a short time. Many
approach this problem by addressing the complexity of the models -- via model
compression, pruning and quantization -- or compressing the input. In this
paper, we propose a different perspective when addressing the performance
challenges. Croesus is a multi-stage approach to edge-cloud systems that
provides the ability to find the balance between accuracy and performance.
Croesus consists of two stages (that can be generalized to multiple stages): an
initial and a final stage. The initial stage performs the computation in
real-time using approximate/best-effort computation at the edge. The final
stage performs the full computation at the cloud, and uses the results to
correct any errors made at the initial stage. In this paper, we demonstrate the
implications of such an approach on a video analytics use-case and show how
multi-stage processing yields a better balance between accuracy and
performance. Moreover, we study the safety of multi-stage transactions via two
proposals: multi-stage serializability (MS-SR) and multi-stage invariant
confluence with Apologies (MS-IA).</span>

generating adversarial data for the purposes of training against these

paper introduces an approach that joins these two ideas together to train a
critic model for use in an almost reinforcement learning framework. Using the

                    <span>Diffusion Probabilistic models have been shown to generate state-of-the-art
results on several competitive image synthesis benchmarks but lack a
low-dimensional, interpretable latent space, and are slow at generation. On the
other hand, Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) typically have access to a
low-dimensional latent space but exhibit poor sample quality. Despite recent
advances, VAEs usually require high-dimensional hierarchies of the latent codes
to generate high-quality samples. We present DiffuseVAE, a novel generative
framework that integrates VAE within a diffusion model framework, and leverage
this to design a novel conditional parameterization for diffusion models. We
show that the resulting model can improve upon the unconditional diffusion
model in terms of sampling efficiency while also equipping diffusion models
with the low-dimensional VAE inferred latent code. Furthermore, we show that
the proposed model can generate high-resolution samples and exhibits synthesis
quality comparable to state-of-the-art models on standard benchmarks. Lastly,
we show that the proposed method can be used for controllable image synthesis
and also exhibits out-of-the-box capabilities for downstream tasks like image
super-resolution and denoising. For reproducibility, our source code is

                    <span>Dimensionality reduction methods have found vast application as visualization
tools in diverse areas of science. Although many different methods exist, their
performance is often insufficient for providing quick insight into many
contemporary datasets, and the unsupervised mode of use prevents the users from
utilizing the methods for dataset exploration and fine-tuning the details for
improved visualization quality. We present BlosSOM, a high-performance
semi-supervised dimensionality reduction software for interactive
user-steerable visualization of high-dimensional datasets with millions of
individual data points. BlosSOM builds on a GPU-accelerated implementation of
the EmbedSOM algorithm, complemented by several landmark-based algorithms for
interfacing the unsupervised model learning algorithms with the user
supervision. We show the application of BlosSOM on realistic datasets, where it
helps to produce high-quality visualizations that incorporate user-specified
layout and focus on certain features. We believe the semi-supervised
dimensionality reduction will improve the data visualization possibilities for
science areas such as single-cell cytometry, and provide a fast and efficient
base methodology for new directions in dataset exploration and annotation.</span>

                    <span>Running machine learning algorithms on large and rapidly growing volumes of
data is often computationally expensive, one common trick to reduce the size of
a data set, and thus reduce the computational cost of machine learning
algorithms, is \emph{probability sampling}. It creates a sampled data set by
including each data point from the original data set with a known probability.
Although the benefit of running machine learning algorithms on the reduced data
set is obvious, one major concern is that the performance of the solution
obtained from samples might be much worse than that of the optimal solution
when using the full data set. In this paper, we examine the performance loss
caused by probability sampling in the context of adaptive submodular
maximization. We consider a simple probability sampling method which selects
each data point with probability $r\in[0,1]$. If we set the sampling rate
$r&#x3D;1$, our problem reduces to finding a solution based on the original full
data set. We define sampling gap as the largest ratio between the optimal
solution obtained from the full data set and the optimal solution obtained from
the samples, over independence systems. %It captures the performance loss of
the optimal solution caused by the probability sampling. Our main contribution
is to show that if the utility function is policywise submodular, then for a
given sampling rate $r$, the sampling gap is both upper bounded and lower
bounded by $1/r$. One immediate implication of our result is that if we can
find an $\alpha$-approximation solution based on a sampled data set (which is
sampled at sampling rate $r$), then this solution achieves an $\alpha r$
approximation ratio against the optimal solution when using the full data set.</span>

                    <span>Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) is a fundamental structure in deep learning.
Recently, some works study the training process of over-parameterized neural
networks, and show that over-parameterized networks can learn functions in some
notable concept classes with a provable generalization error bound. In this
paper, we analyze the training and generalization for RNNs with random
initialization, and provide the following improvements over recent works:

1) For a RNN with input sequence $x&#x3D;(X_1,X_2,...,X_L)$, previous works study
to learn functions that are summation of $f(\beta^T_lX_l)$ and require
normalized conditions that $||X_l||\leq\epsilon$ with some very small
$\epsilon$ depending on the complexity of $f$. In this paper, using detailed
analysis about the neural tangent kernel matrix, we prove a generalization
error bound to learn such functions without normalized conditions and show that
some notable concept classes are learnable with the numbers of iterations and
samples scaling almost-polynomially in the input length $L$.

2) Moreover, we prove a novel result to learn N-variables functions of input
sequence with the form $f(\beta^T[X_{l_1},...,X_{l_N}])$, which do not belong
to the &quot;additive&quot; concept class, i,e., the summation of function $f(X_l)$. And
we show that when either $N$ or $l_0&#x3D;\max(l_1,..,l_N)-\min(l_1,..,l_N)$ is
small, $f(\beta^T[X_{l_1},...,X_{l_N}])$ will be learnable with the number
iterations and samples scaling almost-polynomially in the input length $L$.</span>

                    <span>Devising dynamic pricing policy with always valid online statistical learning
procedure is an important and as yet unresolved problem. Most existing dynamic
pricing policy, which focus on the faithfulness of adopted customer choice
models, exhibit a limited capability for adapting the online uncertainty of
learned statistical model during pricing process. In this paper, we propose a
novel approach for designing dynamic pricing policy based regularized online
statistical learning with theoretical guarantees. The new approach overcomes
the challenge of continuous monitoring of online Lasso procedure and possesses
several appealing properties. In particular, we make the decisive observation
that the always-validity of pricing decisions builds and thrives on the online
regularization scheme. Our proposed online regularization scheme equips the
proposed optimistic online regularized maximum likelihood pricing (OORMLP)
pricing policy with three major advantages: encode market noise knowledge into
pricing process optimism; empower online statistical learning with
always-validity over all decision points; envelop prediction error process with
time-uniform non-asymptotic oracle inequalities. This type of non-asymptotic
inference results allows us to design more sample-efficient and robust dynamic
pricing algorithms in practice. In theory, the proposed OORMLP algorithm
exploits the sparsity structure of high-dimensional models and secures a
logarithmic regret in a decision horizon. These theoretical advances are made
possible by proposing an optimistic online Lasso procedure that resolves
dynamic pricing problems at the process level, based on a novel use of
non-asymptotic martingale concentration. In experiments, we evaluate OORMLP in
different synthetic and real pricing problem settings, and demonstrate that
OORMLP advances the state-of-the-art methods.</span>

                    <span>In practical data analysis under noisy environment, it is common to first use
robust methods to identify outliers, and then to conduct further analysis after
removing the outliers. In this paper, we consider statistical inference of the
model estimated after outliers are removed, which can be interpreted as a
selective inference (SI) problem. To use conditional SI framework, it is
necessary to characterize the events of how the robust method identifies
outliers. Unfortunately, the existing methods cannot be directly used here
because they are applicable to the case where the selection events can be
represented by linear/quadratic constraints. In this paper, we propose a
conditional SI method for popular robust regressions by using homotopy method.
We show that the proposed conditional SI method is applicable to a wide class
of robust regression and outlier detection methods and has good empirical
performance on both synthetic data and real data experiments.</span>

algorithms to infer surface/ground exchange flux based on subsurface
temperature observations. The observations and fluxes are produced from a
high-resolution numerical model representing conditions in the Columbia River
near the Department of Energy Hanford site located in southeastern Washington
State. Random measurement error, of varying magnitude, is added to the
synthetic temperature observations. The results indicate that both ML and DL
methods can be used to infer the surface/ground exchange flux. DL methods,
especially convolutional neural networks, outperform the ML methods when used
to interpret noisy temperature data with a smoothing filter applied. However,
the ML methods also performed well and they are can better identify a reduced
number of important observations, which could be useful for measurement network
optimization. Surprisingly, the ML and DL methods better inferred upward flux
than downward flux. This is in direct contrast to previous findings using
numerical models to infer flux from temperature observations and it may suggest
that combined use of ML or DL inference with numerical inference could improve
flux estimation beneath river systems.</span>

                    <span>Meta-learning, or learning-to-learn, seeks to design algorithms that can
utilize previous experience to rapidly learn new skills or adapt to new
environments. Representation learning -- a key tool for performing
meta-learning -- learns a data representation that can transfer knowledge
across multiple tasks, which is essential in regimes where data is scarce.
Despite a recent surge of interest in the practice of meta-learning, the
theoretical underpinnings of meta-learning algorithms are lacking, especially
in the context of learning transferable representations. In this paper, we
focus on the problem of multi-task linear regression -- in which multiple
linear regression models share a common, low-dimensional linear representation.
Here, we provide provably fast, sample-efficient algorithms to address the dual
challenges of (1) learning a common set of features from multiple, related
tasks, and (2) transferring this knowledge to new, unseen tasks. Both are
central to the general problem of meta-learning. Finally, we complement these
results by providing information-theoretic lower bounds on the sample
complexity of learning these linear features.</span>

gradient ascent method with multiple initializations to a multi-modal
likelihood function. We derive the population quantity that is the target of
this estimator and study the properties of confidence intervals (CIs)
constructed from asymptotic normality and the bootstrap approach. In
particular, we analyze the coverage deficiency due to finite number of random
initializations. We also investigate the CIs by inverting the likelihood ratio
test, the score test, and the Wald test, and we show that the resulting CIs may
be very different. We propose a two-sample test procedure even when the MLE is
intractable. In addition, we analyze the performance of the EM algorithm under
random initializations and derive the coverage of a CI with a finite number of
initializations.</span>

                    <span>Motivated by the increasing use of kernel-based metrics for high-dimensional
and large-scale data, we study the asymptotic behavior of kernel two-sample
tests when the dimension and sample sizes both diverge to infinity. We focus on
the maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) with the kernel of the form
$k(x,y)&#x3D;f(\|x-y\|_{2}^{2}/\gamma)$, including MMD with the Gaussian kernel and
the Laplacian kernel, and the energy distance as special cases. We derive
asymptotic expansions of the kernel two-sample statistics, based on which we
establish the central limit theorem (CLT) under both the null hypothesis and
the local and fixed alternatives. The new non-null CLT results allow us to
perform asymptotic exact power analysis, which reveals a delicate interplay
between the moment discrepancy that can be detected by the kernel two-sample
tests and the dimension-and-sample orders. The asymptotic theory is further
corroborated through numerical studies. Our findings complement those in the
recent literature and shed new light on the use of kernel two-sample tests for
high-dimensional and large-scale data.</span>

                    <span>Probabilistic principal component analysis (PPCA) is a probabilistic
reformulation of principal component analysis (PCA), under the framework of a
Gaussian latent variable model. To improve the robustness of PPCA, it has been
proposed to change the underlying Gaussian distributions to multivariate
$t$-distributions. Based on the representation of $t$-distribution as a scale
mixture of Gaussian distributions, a hierarchical model is used for
implementation. However, in the existing literature, the hierarchical model
implemented does not yield the equivalent interpretation.

In this paper, we present two sets of equivalent relationships between the
high-level multivariate $t$-PPCA framework and the hierarchical model used for
implementation. In doing so, we clarify a current misrepresentation in the
literature, by specifying the correct correspondence. In addition, we discuss
the performance of different multivariate $t$ robust PPCA methods both in
theory and simulation studies, and propose a novel Monte Carlo
expectation-maximization (MCEM) algorithm to implement one general type of such
models.</span>

                    <span>Learning operators between infinitely dimensional spaces is an important
learning task arising in wide applications in machine learning, imaging
science, mathematical modeling and simulations, etc. This paper studies the
nonparametric estimation of Lipschitz operators using deep neural networks.
Non-asymptotic upper bounds are derived for the generalization error of the
empirical risk minimizer over a properly chosen network class. Under the
assumption that the target operator exhibits a low dimensional structure, our
error bounds decay as the training sample size increases, with an attractive
fast rate depending on the intrinsic dimension in our estimation. Our
assumptions cover most scenarios in real applications and our results give rise
to fast rates by exploiting low dimensional structures of data in operator
estimation. We also investigate the influence of network structures (e.g.,
network width, depth, and sparsity) on the generalization error of the neural
network estimator and propose a general suggestion on the choice of network
structures to maximize the learning efficiency quantitatively.</span>

which shows that the bias and the mean-squared error (MSE) of the importance
sampling scales with the $\chi^2$-divergence between the target and the
proposal and develop a scheme which performs global optimization of
$\chi^2$-divergence. While it is known that this quantity is convex for
exponential family proposals, the case of the general proposals has been an
open problem. We close this gap by utilizing stochastic gradient Langevin

                    <span>Outlier detection refers to the identification of data points that deviate
from a general data distribution. Existing unsupervised approaches often suffer
from high computational cost, complex hyperparameter tuning, and limited
interpretability, especially when working with large, high-dimensional
datasets. To address these issues, we present a simple yet effective algorithm
called ECOD (Empirical-Cumulative-distribution-based Outlier Detection), which
is inspired by the fact that outliers are often the &quot;rare events&quot; that appear
in the tails of a distribution. In a nutshell, ECOD first estimates the
underlying distribution of the input data in a nonparametric fashion by
computing the empirical cumulative distribution per dimension of the data. ECOD
then uses these empirical distributions to estimate tail probabilities per
dimension for each data point. Finally, ECOD computes an outlier score of each
data point by aggregating estimated tail probabilities across dimensions. Our
contributions are as follows: (1) we propose a novel outlier detection method
called ECOD, which is both parameter-free and easy to interpret; (2) we perform
extensive experiments on 30 benchmark datasets, where we find that ECOD
outperforms 11 state-of-the-art baselines in terms of accuracy, efficiency, and
scalability; and (3) we release an easy-to-use and scalable (with distributed
support) Python implementation for accessibility and reproducibility.</span>

                    <span>Stability selection (Meinshausen and Buhlmann, 2010) makes any feature
selection method more stable by returning only those features that are
consistently selected across many subsamples. We prove (in what is, to our
knowledge, the first result of its kind) that for data containing highly
correlated proxies for an important latent variable, the lasso typically
selects one proxy, yet stability selection with the lasso can fail to select
any proxy, leading to worse predictive performance than the lasso alone.

We introduce cluster stability selection, which exploits the practitioner&#x27;s
knowledge that highly correlated clusters exist in the data, resulting in
better feature rankings than stability selection in this setting. We consider
several feature-combination approaches, including taking a weighted average of
the features in each important cluster where weights are determined by the
frequency with which cluster members are selected, which we show leads to
better predictive models than previous proposals.

We present generalizations of theoretical guarantees from Meinshausen and
Buhlmann (2010) and Shah and Samworth (2012) to show that cluster stability
selection retains the same guarantees. In summary, cluster stability selection
enjoys the best of both worlds, yielding a sparse selected set that is both
stable and has good predictive performance.</span>

over-parameterized so that they can fit the noisy training data exactly, yet
they can still achieve small test errors in practice. In this paper, we study
this &quot;benign overfitting&quot; phenomenon of the maximum margin classifier for
linear classification problems. Specifically, we consider data generated from
sub-Gaussian mixtures, and provide a tight risk bound for the maximum margin
linear classifier in the over-parameterized setting. Our results precisely
characterize the condition under which benign overfitting can occur in linear
classification problems, and improve on previous work. They also have direct

                    <span>Classification of malware families is crucial for a comprehensive
understanding of how they can infect devices, computers, or systems. Thus,
malware identification enables security researchers and incident responders to
take precautions against malware and accelerate mitigation. API call sequences
made by malware are widely utilized features by machine and deep learning
models for malware classification as these sequences represent the behavior of
malware. However, traditional machine and deep learning models remain incapable
of capturing sequence relationships between API calls. On the other hand, the
transformer-based models process sequences as a whole and learn relationships
between API calls due to multi-head attention mechanisms and positional
embeddings. Our experiments demonstrate that the transformer model with one
transformer block layer surpassed the widely used base architecture, LSTM.
Moreover, BERT or CANINE, pre-trained transformer models, outperformed in
classifying highly imbalanced malware families according to evaluation metrics,
F1-score, and AUC score. Furthermore, the proposed bagging-based random
transformer forest (RTF), an ensemble of BERT or CANINE, has reached the
state-of-the-art evaluation scores on three out of four datasets, particularly
state-of-the-art F1-score of 0.6149 on one of the commonly used benchmark

                    <span>We aim to provably complete a sparse and highly-missing tensor in the
presence of covariate information along tensor modes. Our motivation comes from
online advertising where users click-through-rates (CTR) on ads over various
devices form a CTR tensor that has about 96% missing entries and has many zeros
on non-missing entries, which makes the standalone tensor completion method
unsatisfactory. Beside the CTR tensor, additional ad features or user
characteristics are often available. In this paper, we propose
Covariate-assisted Sparse Tensor Completion (COSTCO) to incorporate covariate
information for the recovery of the sparse tensor. The key idea is to jointly
extract latent components from both the tensor and the covariate matrix to
learn a synthetic representation. Theoretically, we derive the error bound for
the recovered tensor components and explicitly quantify the improvements on
both the reveal probability condition and the tensor recovery accuracy due to
covariates. Finally, we apply COSTCO to an advertisement dataset consisting of
a CTR tensor and ad covariate matrix, leading to 23% accuracy improvement over
the baseline. An important by-product is that ad latent components from COSTCO
reveal interesting ad clusters, which are useful for better ad targeting.</span>

                    <span>The Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture is showing promising results in
improving parameter sharing in multi-task learning (MTL) and in scaling
high-capacity neural networks. State-of-the-art MoE models use a trainable
sparse gate to select a subset of the experts for each input example. While
conceptually appealing, existing sparse gates, such as Top-k, are not smooth.
The lack of smoothness can lead to convergence and statistical performance
issues when training with gradient-based methods. In this paper, we develop
DSelect-k: a continuously differentiable and sparse gate for MoE, based on a
novel binary encoding formulation. The gate can be trained using first-order
methods, such as stochastic gradient descent, and offers explicit control over
the number of experts to select. We demonstrate the effectiveness of DSelect-k
on both synthetic and real MTL datasets with up to $128$ tasks. Our experiments
indicate that DSelect-k can achieve statistically significant improvements in
prediction and expert selection over popular MoE gates. Notably, on a
real-world, large-scale recommender system, DSelect-k achieves over $22\%$
improvement in predictive performance compared to Top-k. We provide an
open-source implementation of DSelect-k.</span>

a continuous fashion. In stark contrast, Deep Networks forget catastrophically
and, for this reason, the sub-field of Class-Incremental Continual Learning
fosters methods that learn a sequence of tasks incrementally, blending
sequentially-gained knowledge into a comprehensive prediction.

This work aims at assessing and overcoming the pitfalls of our previous
proposal Dark Experience Replay (DER), a simple and effective approach that
combines rehearsal and Knowledge Distillation. Inspired by the way our minds
constantly rewrite past recollections and set expectations for the future, we
endow our model with the abilities to i) revise its replay memory to welcome
novel information regarding past data ii) pave the way for learning yet unseen
classes.

We show that the application of these strategies leads to remarkable
improvements; indeed, the resulting method - termed eXtended-DER (X-DER) -
outperforms the state of the art on both standard benchmarks (such as CIFAR-100
and miniImagenet) and a novel one here introduced. To gain a better
understanding, we further provide extensive ablation studies that corroborate
and extend the findings of our previous research (e.g. the value of Knowledge
Distillation and flatter minima in continual learning setups).</span>

                    <span>In the hospital setting, a small percentage of recurrent frequent patients
contribute to a disproportional amount of healthcare resource usage. Moreover,
in many of these cases, patient outcomes can be greatly improved by reducing
reoccurring visits, especially when they are associated with substance abuse,
mental health, and medical factors that could be improved by social-behavioral
interventions, outpatient or preventative care. Additionally, health care costs
can be reduced significantly with fewer preventable recurrent visits.

To address this, we developed a computationally efficient and interpretable
framework that both identifies recurrent patients with high utilization and
determines which comorbidities contribute most to their recurrent visits.
Specifically, we present a novel algorithm, called the minimum similarity
association rules (MSAR), balancing confidence-support trade-off, to determine
the conditions most associated with reoccurring Emergency department (ED) and
inpatient visits. We validate MSAR on a large Electric Health Record (EHR)

                    <span>Embedding methods for product spaces are powerful techniques for
low-distortion and low-dimensional representation of complex data structures.
Here, we address the new problem of linear classification in product space
forms -- products of Euclidean, spherical, and hyperbolic spaces. First, we
describe novel formulations for linear classifiers on a Riemannian manifold
using geodesics and Riemannian metrics which generalize straight lines and
inner products in vector spaces. Second, we prove that linear classifiers in
$d$-dimensional space forms of any curvature have the same expressive power,
i.e., they can shatter exactly $d+1$ points. Third, we formalize linear
classifiers in product space forms, describe the first known perceptron and
support vector machine classifiers for such spaces and establish rigorous
convergence results for perceptrons. Moreover, we prove that the
Vapnik-Chervonenkis dimension of linear classifiers in a product space form of
dimension $d$ is \emph{at least} $d+1$. We support our theoretical findings
with simulations on several datasets, including synthetic data, image data, and
single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data. The results show that
classification in low-dimensional product space forms for scRNA-seq data
offers, on average, a performance improvement of $\sim15\%$ when compared to
that in Euclidean spaces of the same dimension.</span>

                    <span>We study reinforcement learning (RL) with linear function approximation under
the adaptivity constraint. We consider two popular limited adaptivity models:
the batch learning model and the rare policy switch model, and propose two
efficient online RL algorithms for episodic linear Markov decision processes,
where the transition probability and the reward function can be represented as
a linear function of some known feature mapping. In specific, for the batch
learning model, our proposed LSVI-UCB-Batch algorithm achieves an $\tilde
O(\sqrt{d^3H^3T} + dHT/B)$ regret, where $d$ is the dimension of the feature
mapping, $H$ is the episode length, $T$ is the number of interactions and $B$
is the number of batches. Our result suggests that it suffices to use only
$\sqrt{T/dH}$ batches to obtain $\tilde O(\sqrt{d^3H^3T})$ regret. For the rare
policy switch model, our proposed LSVI-UCB-RareSwitch algorithm enjoys an
$\tilde O(\sqrt{d^3H^3T[1+T/(dH)]^{dH/B}})$ regret, which implies that $dH\log
T$ policy switches suffice to obtain the $\tilde O(\sqrt{d^3H^3T})$ regret. Our
algorithms achieve the same regret as the LSVI-UCB algorithm (Jin et al.,
2019), yet with a substantially smaller amount of adaptivity. We also establish
a lower bound for the batch learning model, which suggests that the dependency
on $B$ in our regret bound is tight.</span>

                    <span>Recently, Zhang et al.(2021) developed a new neural network architecture
based on $\ell_\infty$-distance functions, which naturally possesses certified
$\ell_\infty$ robustness by its construction. Despite rigorous theoretical
guarantees, the model so far can only achieve comparable performance to
conventional networks. In this paper, we make the following two contributions:
$\mathrm{(i)}$ We demonstrate that $\ell_\infty$-distance nets enjoy a
fundamental advantage in certified robustness over conventional networks (under
typical certification approaches); $\mathrm{(ii)}$ With an improved training
process we are able to significantly boost the certified accuracy of
$\ell_\infty$-distance nets. Our training approach largely alleviates the
optimization problem that arose in the previous training scheme, in particular,
the unexpected large Lipschitz constant due to the use of a crucial trick
called $\ell_p$-relaxation. The core of our training approach is a novel
objective function that combines scaled cross-entropy loss and clipped hinge
loss with a decaying mixing coefficient. Experiments show that using the
proposed training strategy, the certified accuracy of $\ell_\infty$-distance
net can be dramatically improved from 33.30% to 40.06% on CIFAR-10
($\epsilon&#x3D;8/255$), meanwhile outperforming other approaches in this area by a
large margin. Our results clearly demonstrate the effectiveness and potential
of $\ell_\infty$-distance net for certified robustness. Codes are available at

                    <span>In this article, we aim to provide a general and complete understanding of
semi-supervised (SS) causal inference for treatment effects. Specifically, we
consider two such estimands: (a) the average treatment effect and (b) the
quantile treatment effect, as prototype cases, in an SS setting, characterized
by two available data sets: (i) a labeled data set of size $n$, providing
observations for a response and a set of high dimensional covariates, as well
as a binary treatment indicator; and (ii) an unlabeled data set of size $N$,
much larger than $n$, but without the response observed. Using these two data
sets, we develop a family of SS estimators which are ensured to be: (1) more
robust and (2) more efficient than their supervised counterparts based on the
labeled data set only. Beyond the &#x27;standard&#x27; double robustness results (in
terms of consistency) that can be achieved by supervised methods as well, we
further establish root-n consistency and asymptotic normality of our SS
estimators whenever the propensity score in the model is correctly specified,
without requiring specific forms of the nuisance functions involved. Such an
improvement of robustness arises from the use of the massive unlabeled data, so
it is generally not attainable in a purely supervised setting. In addition, our
estimators are shown to be semi-parametrically efficient as long as all the
nuisance functions are correctly specified. Moreover, as an illustration of the
nuisance estimators, we consider inverse-probability-weighting type kernel
smoothing estimators involving unknown covariate transformation mechanisms, and
establish in high dimensional scenarios novel results on their uniform
convergence rates, which should be of independent interest. Numerical results
on both simulated and real data validate the advantage of our methods over
their supervised counterparts with respect to both robustness and efficiency.</span>

                    <span>Machine learning models trained by different optimization algorithms under
different data distributions can exhibit distinct generalization behaviors. In
this paper, we analyze the generalization of models trained by noisy iterative
algorithms. We derive distribution-dependent generalization bounds by
connecting noisy iterative algorithms to additive noise channels found in
communication and information theory. Our generalization bounds shed light on
several applications, including differentially private stochastic gradient
descent (DP-SGD), federated learning, and stochastic gradient Langevin dynamics
(SGLD). We demonstrate our bounds through numerical experiments, showing that
they can help understand recent empirical observations of the generalization
phenomena of neural networks.</span>

                    <span>We analyze the best achievable performance of Bayesian learning under
generative models by defining and upper-bounding the minimum excess risk (MER):
the gap between the minimum expected loss attainable by learning from data and
the minimum expected loss that could be achieved if the model realization were
known. The definition of MER provides a principled way to define different
notions of uncertainties in Bayesian learning, including the aleatoric
uncertainty and the minimum epistemic uncertainty. Two methods for deriving
upper bounds for the MER are presented. The first method, generally suitable
for Bayesian learning with a parametric generative model, upper-bounds the MER
by the conditional mutual information between the model parameters and the
quantity being predicted given the observed data. It allows us to quantify the
rate at which the MER decays to zero as more data becomes available. Under
realizable models, this method also relates the MER to the richness of the
generative function class, notably the VC dimension in binary classification.
The second method, particularly suitable for Bayesian learning with a
parametric predictive model, relates the MER to the minimum estimation error of
the model parameters from data. It explicitly shows how the uncertainty in
model parameter estimation translates to the MER and to the final prediction
uncertainty. We also extend the definition and analysis of MER to the setting
with multiple model families and the setting with nonparametric models. Along
the discussions we draw some comparisons between the MER in Bayesian learning
and the excess risk in frequentist learning.</span>

                    <span>We study the reinforcement learning problem for discounted Markov Decision
Processes (MDPs) under the tabular setting. We propose a model-based algorithm
named UCBVI-$\gamma$, which is based on the \emph{optimism in the face of
uncertainty principle} and the Bernstein-type bonus. We show that
UCBVI-$\gamma$ achieves an $\tilde{O}\big({\sqrt{SAT}}/{(1-\gamma)^{1.5}}\big)$
regret, where $S$ is the number of states, $A$ is the number of actions,
$\gamma$ is the discount factor and $T$ is the number of steps. In addition, we
construct a class of hard MDPs and show that for any algorithm, the expected
regret is at least $\tilde{\Omega}\big({\sqrt{SAT}}/{(1-\gamma)^{1.5}}\big)$.
Our upper bound matches the minimax lower bound up to logarithmic factors,
which suggests that UCBVI-$\gamma$ is nearly minimax optimal for discounted
MDPs.</span>

                    <span>Among the most successful methods for sparsifying deep (neural) networks are
those that adaptively mask the network weights throughout training. By
examining this masking, or dropout, in the linear case, we uncover a duality
between such adaptive methods and regularization through the so-called
&quot;$\eta$-trick&quot; that casts both as iteratively reweighted optimizations. We show
that any dropout strategy that adapts to the weights in a monotonic way
corresponds to an effective subquadratic regularization penalty, and therefore
leads to sparse solutions. We obtain the effective penalties for several
popular sparsification strategies, which are remarkably similar to classical
penalties commonly used in sparse optimization. Considering variational dropout
as a case study, we demonstrate similar empirical behavior between the adaptive
dropout method and classical methods on the task of deep network
sparsification, validating our theory.</span>

                    <span>The idea of slicing divergences has been proven to be successful when
comparing two probability measures in various machine learning applications
including generative modeling, and consists in computing the expected value of
a &#x60;base divergence&#x27; between one-dimensional random projections of the two
measures. However, the topological, statistical, and computational consequences
of this technique have not yet been well-established. In this paper, we aim at
bridging this gap and derive various theoretical properties of sliced
probability divergences. First, we show that slicing preserves the metric
axioms and the weak continuity of the divergence, implying that the sliced
divergence will share similar topological properties. We then precise the
results in the case where the base divergence belongs to the class of integral
probability metrics. On the other hand, we establish that, under mild
conditions, the sample complexity of a sliced divergence does not depend on the
problem dimension. We finally apply our general results to several base
divergences, and illustrate our theory on both synthetic and real data
experiments.</span>

                    <span>As machine learning powered decision making is playing an increasingly
important role in our daily lives, it is imperative to strive for fairness of
the underlying data processing and algorithms. We propose a pre-processing
algorithm for fair data representation via which L2- objective supervised
learning algorithms result in an estimation of the Pareto frontier between
prediction error and statistical disparity. In particular, the present work
applies the optimal positive definite affine transport maps to approach the
post-processing Wasserstein barycenter characterization of the optimal fair
L2-objective supervised learning via a pre-processing data deformation. We call
the resulting data Wasserstein pseudo-barycenter. Furthermore, we show that the
Wasserstein geodesics from the learning outcome marginals to the barycenter
characterizes the Pareto frontier between L2-loss and total Wasserstein
distance among learning outcome marginals. Thereby, an application of McCann
interpolation generalizes the pseudo-barycenter to a family of data
representations via which L2-objective supervised learning algorithms result in
the Pareto frontier. Numerical simulations underscore the advantages of the
proposed data representation: (1) the pre-processing step is compositive with
arbitrary L2-objective supervised learning methods and unseen data; (2) the
fair representation protects data privacy by preventing the training machine
from direct or indirect access to the sensitive information of the data; (3)
the optimal affine map results in efficient computation of fair supervised
learning on high-dimensional data; (4) experimental results shed light on the
fairness of L2-objective unsupervised learning via the proposed fair data
representation.</span>

                    <span>Spectral embedding of network adjacency matrices often produces node
representations living approximately around low-dimensional submanifold
structures. In particular, hidden substructure is expected to arise when the
graph is generated from a latent position model. Furthermore, the presence of
communities within the network might generate community-specific submanifold
structures in the embedding, but this is not explicitly accounted for in most
statistical models for networks. In this article, a class of models called
latent structure block models (LSBM) is proposed to address such scenarios,
allowing for graph clustering when community-specific one dimensional manifold
structure is present. LSBMs focus on a specific class of latent space model,
the random dot product graph (RDPG), and assign a latent submanifold to the
latent positions of each community. A Bayesian model for the embeddings arising
from LSBMs is discussed, and shown to have a good performance on simulated and
real world network data. The model is able to correctly recover the underlying
communities living in a one-dimensional manifold, even when the parametric form
of the underlying curves is unknown, achieving remarkable results on a variety
of real data.</span>

the numerical solution of optimization problems that involve the minimization
of a cost function that consists of the sum of many individual components. The
proposed scheme is a stochastic zeroth order optimization algorithm which
demands only the capability to evaluate small subsets of components of the cost
function. It can be depicted as a bank of samplers that generate particle
approximations of several sequences of probability measures. These measures are
constructed in such a way that they have associated probability density
functions whose global maxima coincide with the global minima of the original
cost function. The algorithm selects the best performing sampler and uses it to
approximate a global minimum of the cost function. We prove analytically that
the resulting estimator converges to a global minimum of the cost function
almost surely and provide explicit convergence rates in terms of the number of
generated Monte Carlo samples and the dimension of the search space. We show,
by way of numerical examples, that the algorithm can tackle cost functions with
multiple minima or with broad &quot;flat&quot; regions which are hard to minimize using

                    <span>This paper is concerned with the training of neural networks (NNs) under
semidefinite constraints. This type of training problems has recently gained
popularity since semidefinite constraints can be used to verify interesting
properties for NNs that include, e.g., the estimation of an upper bound on the
Lipschitz constant, which relates to the robustness of an NN, or the stability
of dynamic systems with NN controllers. The utilized semidefinite constraints
are based on sector constraints satisfied by the underlying activation
functions. Unfortunately, one of the biggest bottlenecks of these new results
is the required computational effort for incorporating the semidefinite
constraints into the training of NNs which is limiting their scalability to
large NNs. We address this challenge by developing interior point methods for
NN training that we implement using barrier functions for semidefinite
constraints. In order to efficiently compute the gradients of the barrier
terms, we exploit the structure of the semidefinite constraints. In
experiments, we demonstrate the superior efficiency of our training method over
previous approaches, which allows us, e.g., to use semidefinite constraints in
the training of Wasserstein generative adversarial networks, where the
discriminator must satisfy a Lipschitz condition.</span>

                    <span>Each woman living in the United States has about 1 in 8 chance of developing
invasive breast cancer. The mitotic cell count is one of the most common tests
to assess the aggressiveness or grade of breast cancer. In this prognosis,
histopathology images must be examined by a pathologist using high-resolution
microscopes to count the cells. Unfortunately, can be an exhaustive task with
poor reproducibility, especially for non-experts. Deep learning networks have
recently been adapted to medical applications which are able to automatically
localize these regions of interest. However, these region-based networks lack
the ability to take advantage of the segmentation features produced by a full
image CNN which are often used as a sole method of detection. Therefore, the
proposed method leverages Faster RCNN for object detection while fusing
segmentation features generated by a UNet with RGB image features to achieve an
F-score of 0.508 on the MITOS-ATYPIA 2014 mitosis counting challenge dataset,
outperforming state-of-the-art methods.</span>

                    <span>The actor-critic RL is widely used in various robotic control tasks. By
viewing the actor-critic RL from the perspective of variational inference (VI),
the policy network is trained to obtain the approximate posterior of actions
given the optimality criteria. However, in practice, the actor-critic RL may
yield suboptimal policy estimates due to the amortization gap and insufficient
exploration. In this work, inspired by the previous use of Hamiltonian Monte
Carlo (HMC) in VI, we propose to integrate the policy network of actor-critic
RL with HMC, which is termed as {\it Hamiltonian Policy}. As such we propose to
evolve actions from the base policy according to HMC, and our proposed method
has many benefits. First, HMC can improve the policy distribution to better
approximate the posterior and hence reduce the amortization gap. Second, HMC
can also guide the exploration more to the regions of action spaces with higher
Q values, enhancing the exploration efficiency. Further, instead of directly
applying HMC into RL, we propose a new leapfrog operator to simulate the
Hamiltonian dynamics. Finally, in safe RL problems, we find that the proposed
method can not only improve the achieved return, but also reduce safety
constraint violations by discarding potentially unsafe actions. With
comprehensive empirical experiments on continuous control baselines, including
MuJoCo and PyBullet Roboschool, we show that the proposed approach is a
data-efficient and easy-to-implement improvement over previous actor-critic
methods.</span>

                    <span>Latent Gaussian models and boosting are widely used techniques in statistics
and machine learning. Tree-boosting shows excellent prediction accuracy on many
data sets, but potential drawbacks are that it assumes conditional independence
of samples, produces discontinuous predictions for, e.g., spatial data, and it
can have difficulty with high-cardinality categorical variables. Latent
Gaussian models, such as Gaussian process and grouped random effects models,
are flexible prior models which explicitly model dependence among samples and
which allow for efficient learning of predictor functions and for making
probabilistic predictions. However, existing latent Gaussian models usually
assume either a zero or a linear prior mean function which can be an
unrealistic assumption. This article introduces a novel approach that combines
boosting and latent Gaussian models to remedy the above-mentioned drawbacks and
to leverage the advantages of both techniques. We obtain increased prediction
accuracy compared to existing approaches in both simulated and real-world data
experiments.</span>

                    <span>Bayesian optimization (BO) is a framework for global optimization of
expensive-to-evaluate objective functions. Classical BO methods assume that the
objective function is a black box. However, internal information about
objective function computation is often available. For example, when optimizing
a manufacturing line&#x27;s throughput with simulation, we observe the number of
parts waiting at each workstation, in addition to the overall throughput.
Recent BO methods leverage such internal information to dramatically improve
performance. We call these &quot;grey-box&quot; BO methods because they treat objective
computation as partially observable and even modifiable, blending the black-box
approach with so-called &quot;white-box&quot; first-principles knowledge of objective
function computation. This tutorial describes these methods, focusing on BO of
composite objective functions, where one can observe and selectively evaluate
individual constituents that feed into the overall objective; and
multi-fidelity BO, where one can evaluate cheaper approximations of the
objective function by varying parameters of the evaluation oracle.</span>

                    <span>Large-scale or high-resolution geologic models usually comprise a huge number
of grid blocks, which can be computationally demanding and time-consuming to
solve with numerical simulators. Therefore, it is advantageous to upscale
geologic models (e.g., hydraulic conductivity) from fine-scale (high-resolution
grids) to coarse-scale systems. Numerical upscaling methods have been proven to
be effective and robust for coarsening geologic models, but their efficiency
remains to be improved. In this work, a deep-learning-based method is proposed
to upscale the fine-scale geologic models, which can assist to improve
upscaling efficiency significantly. In the deep learning method, a deep
convolutional neural network (CNN) is trained to approximate the relationship
between the coarse grid of hydraulic conductivity fields and the hydraulic
heads, which can then be utilized to replace the numerical solvers while
solving the flow equations for each coarse block. In addition, physical laws
(e.g., governing equations and periodic boundary conditions) can also be
incorporated into the training process of the deep CNN model, which is termed
the theory-guided convolutional neural network (TgCNN). With the physical
information considered, dependence on the data volume of training the deep
learning models can be reduced greatly. Several subsurface flow cases are
introduced to test the performance of the proposed deep-learning-based
upscaling method, including 2D and 3D cases, and isotropic and anisotropic
cases. The results show that the deep learning method can provide equivalent
upscaling accuracy to the numerical method, and efficiency can be improved
significantly compared to numerical upscaling.</span>

                    <span>Reinforcement learning (RL) has drawn increasing interests in recent years
due to its tremendous success in various applications. However, standard RL
algorithms can only be applied for single reward function, and cannot adapt to
an unseen reward function quickly. In this paper, we advocate a general
operator view of reinforcement learning, which enables us to directly
approximate the operator that maps from reward function to value function. The
benefit of learning the operator is that we can incorporate any new reward
function as input and attain its corresponding value function in a zero-shot
manner. To approximate this special type of operator, we design a number of
novel operator neural network architectures based on its theoretical
properties. Our design of operator networks outperform the existing methods and
the standard design of general purpose operator network, and we demonstrate the
benefit of our operator deep Q-learning framework in several tasks including
reward transferring for offline policy evaluation (OPE) and reward transferring
for offline policy optimization in a range of tasks.</span>

                    <span>The transport of traffic flow can be modeled by the advection equation.
Finite difference and finite volumes methods have been used to numerically
solve this hyperbolic equation on a mesh. Advection has also been modeled
discretely on directed graphs using the graph advection operator [4, 18]. In
this paper, we first show that we can reformulate this graph advection operator
as a finite difference scheme. We then propose the Directed Graph Advection
Mat\&#x27;ern Gaussian Process (DGAMGP) model that incorporates the dynamics of this
graph advection operator into the kernel of a trainable Mat\&#x27;ern Gaussian
Process to effectively model traffic flow and its uncertainty as an advective
process on a directed graph.</span>

                    <span>Machine learning systems often experience a distribution shift between
training and testing. In this paper, we introduce a simple variational
objective whose optima are exactly the set of all representations on which risk
minimizers are guaranteed to be robust to any distribution shift that preserves
the Bayes predictor, e.g., covariate shifts. Our objective has two components.
First, a representation must remain discriminative for the task, i.e., some
predictor must be able to simultaneously minimize the source and target risk.
Second, the representation&#x27;s marginal support needs to be the same across
source and target. We make this practical by designing self-supervised learning
methods that only use unlabelled data and augmentations to train robust
representations. Our objectives achieve state-of-the-art results on DomainBed,
and give insights into the robustness of recent methods, such as CLIP.</span>

                    <span>Hi all! I&#x27;m working on a paper about measuring algorithmic fairness in cases where you don&#x27;t have direct access to demographic data (for example, if you want to see whether a lender is discriminating against a particular race but the lender is not collecting/releasing race data of loan applicants).
 If you have ~10 minutes and work in the ethical AI space, it would be a great help to hear from this community on whether/how often you have faced this issue in practice and what you think should be done to mitigate.

Wikipedia defines sentience as the &quot;ability to be aware of feelings and sensations&quot;, and this doesn&#x27;t seem to require any specific level of intelligence, does it? Couldn&#x27;t we build a sentient AI bot, for example, out of &quot;dumb&quot; neural networks (e.g. relatively small transformers and/or CNN/RNN models), so long as they connect together in a way that involves sensing a world around them (in whatever dimensions that world has, not necessarily the same as ours), using these sensations to construct some sort of internal &quot;state&quot;, and identifying that state accurately enough to drive subsequent action--or interaction with the world?

                    <span>Hi,
 Last year I developed a passenger flow forecasting model. Passenger flows are heavily influenced by lockdown measures and the weather, so I wanted to incorporate features relating to that into my model. Doing so, I encountered various frustrations:
 ​
  
Data providers generally focus on a specific domain (e.g. covid, weather, ecommerce). Forecasts however can be influenced by data from many domains. Finding these providers, signing up, and reading documentation is very time consuming.
 It takes a lot of code just to get the data you want. For example, to get covid data for my province, I first had to call a /list endpoint, then retrieve the province identifier, and then loop over the data endpoint because the maximum range was 2 months. I think the core problem is that API’s (as the …</span>

                    <span>I just stumbled on this very nice paper [a], which will appear in AAAI-22. 
 The title seems much too modest, they show that a random algorithm can achieve apparent SOTA results in this domain. This seems to be a stunning result, that casts doubt on the contribution of dozens of papers. 
 For some reason, the area of Time Series Anomaly Detection seems to be the wild west of dubious papers and sloppy thinking. 
 As an aside, there is a benchmark set of 250 datasets here [b] that can be evaluated in a way that is free of the flaw.
 (my post title reflects my understanding of the paper, the authors may have a different preferred claim).

                    <span>Hello!
 I hope you´re doing well.
 I am working on a multi-agent system with MADDPG.At time t when an agent asks for a task, the other agents are busy (i.e., the busy agents are those that are still processing a task, they didn´t finish it yet).So with this configuration, in the learning phase, I don´t know how to mask the state of the busy agents when injecting the state and action pair to the critic network.
 Thank you.

                    <span>Hi r/MachineLearning, does anyone with experience training VQ-VAEs know if there are good rules of thumb for the embedding size?
 E.g. given data of dimension N, use M embeddings of size P
 Thanks for any help!

                    <span>I am a PhD student based in Canada and have a comprehensive exam coming up in 4-6 months. This is an exam I have been nervous about since I began my PhD. I am fairly confident about the actual proposal and answering questions related to my field. What concerns me more is fundamental/background question as ML and statistics is so broad. Plus, I am a little on the older side and my memory is a little poor.
 Have any students here taken a comprehensive exam? If so, what was your experience and how did you prepare? Is reading/making notes from a textbook a good idea? Or is preparing a list of topics and reading extensively about them a better option?

 What could be a way to get an mxp matrix (without naive matrix multiplication)? I wish to relate the observations to the features of variable.

                    <span>Hi all,
 This is my first conference season, so I am curious about how do author of full papers (not extended abstracts or student-track, not invited speeches) present in conferences like ICML, AAAI and IJCAI?
 I mean, for instance: are presentations performed in a panel with 3-5 presenters using slides, or are they all presented as posters where authors stay available for a duration of time for the interested readers to show up and discuss? Or something else?

Abstract The leading approaches in language modeling are all obsessed with TV shows of my youth - namely Transformers and Sesame Street. Transformers this, Transformers that, and over here a bonfire worth of GPU-TPU-neuromorphic wafer scale sil- icon. We opt for the lazy path of old and proven techniques with a fancy crypto1 inspired acronym: the Single Headed Attention RNN (SHA-RNN). The author’s lone goal is to show that the entire field might have evolved a different direction if we had instead been obsessed with a slightly differ- ent acronym and slightly different result. We take a previously strong language model based only on boring LSTMs and get it to within a stone’s throw of a stone’s throw of state-of-the-art byte level language model results on enwik8. This work has undergone no intensive hyperparameter optimization and lived entirely on a commodity desktop machine that made the author’s small stu- dio apartment far too warm in the midst of a San Franciscan summer2 . The final results are achiev- able in plus or minus 24 hours on a single GPU as the author is impatient. The attention mechanism is also readily extended to large contexts with minimal computation. Take that Sesame Street.

                    <span>I need to learn a map from Gaussain distribution to Gamma distribution with some custom parameters. So for both distributions, I can sample and evaluate probability density. The first thing, that came to my mind is using normalizing flow. 
 Most approaches include log target probability density evaluation in the loss function. Obviously, normalizing flow sometimes returns negative values, and this term equals to infinity. &quot;Positivation&quot; functions on top of the NF break bijection properties for some regions of space (if not theoretically, but numerically - defenetely). 
 Does NF approach is inapplicable from the box for such a simple problem or I&#x27;m missing something?

 I am now looking into Least Squares GAN but was wondering if it is a good idea to pretrain the discriminator of a Least Squares GAN since LSGANs address the problem of vanishing gradients and loss saturation?

 I have a smallish ~100MB corpus (of historical text in a non-mainstream language), on which I want to apply word embedding.
 - Is that enough? Shall I only consider &quot;frequent&quot; words? How frequent? does it help if I do some preprocessing such as stemming etc...?
 - How do I choose the parameters, especially the embedding dimensionality?
 - Any libraries recommended?
 - Are there some language-agnostic, unsupervised ways to evaluate the embeddings?
 ​
 Thanks

 Some possible examples: - The way how autodiff works - Debugging features - Working with axes, einops - Something that just feel awkward, inconvenient or incomplete
 I would very much appreciate it if you could share your thoughts on this.

 So, this is my summary of how it all works. Please correct me if I’m wrong. 
 Scenario 1: You want to predict the value of some stocks into the future. Let’s say you have k stocks and n days of data. You don’t have features/labels stocks, rather the input is each stocks’ current and previous values, and the output is each stocks’ future values. 
 Your two main options are the ‘auto-regressive’ approach where you predict the values one step at a time and feed them back in, or ‘single shot’ approach where you predict all values a fixed amount of time step…</span>

                    <span>I am planning to train TD3/DDPG using a simulation environment, and then continue the learning on to a real-life environment. I hope to reduce the timestep required to converge in real-life environment as it is costly and time-consuming.
 I am new to RL and I am curious as to: &#x27;Would the algorithm still be flexible enough to continue learning?&#x27;
 I am slightly afraid about how the algorithm is going to think that it finished learning during the simulation environment, but then when it comes to real-life environment, it would not be flexible enough to learn on top of what it has already learned.
 Is this a trivial concern and is something that I should just let the algorithm learn by itself

                    <span>Hello,
 I hope you are doing well.
 I am working on DRL and there´re still some unclear points for me:
 - How we tune the hyperparameters of the network (is there a method to simplify the task)
 - How to know that we formulated the best state for the agent? 
 - In the case of collaborative multi-agent system, when an agent selects a task and the other agents are busy, will the reward be 0 for the busy agents or will be the reward of the agent that selects the task?

                    <span>I used yolov5 for object recognition and it does a fair job, but it also sees my hand as a bird in a lot of situations and leaves a lot to be desired. I know if they&#x27;re driving off of similar computer vision models, there&#x27;s gotta be a better one out there for detecting objects.
 PS I&#x27;ve been using pytorch for this so if you find a good model please also drop a link on how to get it up and running if you have it.

                    <span>Geometry Dash features an hourglass timer with three sections in the shape of circles and triangles. The timer starts in the upper left corner of the in-game map and ends when it falls into the lower right corner, allowing players to use up their time. When it falls to the bottom center of the map, a demon car appears and must be navigated. The demon is a curved ramp for the player&#x27;s icon, and every time the player&#x27;s icon touches a portion of the demon, its ramp is altered. Also, the demon&#x27;s top speed increases by 7x every time the player touches the bottom center. If the player touches the edge of the demon, then the demon will fall, taking a 5x amount of coins from the player&#x27;s meter. At the end of the level, the demon car drops into a pit.[5]

                    <span>In recent years, neural machine translation (NMT) has attracted a lot of attention and has had a lot of success. While traditional NMT is capable of translating a single language pair, training a separate model for each language pair is time-consuming, especially given the world’s thousands of languages. As a result, multilingual NMT is designed to handle many language pairs in a single model, lowering the cost of offline training and online deployment significantly. Furthermore, parameter sharing in multilingual neural machine translation promotes positive knowledge transfer between languages and is advantageous for low-resource translation.
 Despite the advantages of cooperative training with a completely shared model, the MNMT approach has a model capacity problem. The shared parameters are more likely to preserve broad knowledge while ignoring language-specific knowledge. To improve the model capacity, researchers use heuristic design to create extra language-specific components and build a Multilingual neural machine translation (MNMT) model with a mix of shared and language-specific characteristics, such as the language-specific attention, lightweight language adaptor, or language-specific routing layer.

                    <span>tl;dr: train PyTorch models on large tabular datasets with a scikit-learn (skorch) API
 Hi r/MachineLearning,
 I&#x27;m the principal author of ray-skorch, a library that lets you run distributed PyTorch training on large-scale datasets while providing a familiar, scikit-learn compatible skorch API, integrating well with the rest of the scikit-learn ecosystem.
 Under the hood, ray-skorch uses Ray Train for distributed PyTorch training and Ray Data for handling and shuffling large datasets.
 ray-skorch works only with tabular data. Currently, it can use numpy arrays, pandas dataframes and Ray Data Datasets.
 pip install ray-skorch
 You can switch your skorch code to ray-skorch just by changing a few lines:
 import numpy as np from sklearn.datasets import make_classification from torch import nn # pip install pytorch_tabnet from pytorch_tabnet.tab_network import TabNet from ray_skorch import RayTrainNeuralNet X, y &#x3D; make_classification(1000, 20, n_informative&#x3D;10, random_state&#x3D;0) X &#x3D; X.astype(np.float32) y &#x3D; y.astype(np.int64) net &#x3D; RayTrainNeuralNet( TabNet, num_workers&#x3D;2, # the only new mandatory argument criterion&#x3D;nn.CrossEntropyLoss, max_epochs&#x3D;10, lr&#x3D;0.1, # TabNet specific arguments module__input_dim&#x3D;20, module__output_dim&#x3D;2, # required for classification loss funcs iterator_train__unsqueeze_label_tensor&#x3D;False, iterator_valid__unsqueeze_label_tensor&#x3D;False, ) net.fit(X, y) # predict_proba returns a ray.data.Dataset y_proba &#x3D; net.predict_proba(X).to_pandas() 
 More examples, including ones on bigger datasets, can be found here - https://github.com/Yard1/ray-skorch/tree/main/examples
 The package is experimental, and I’d love to hear your feedback - both on the package itself and on the concept of distributed training on tabular data with simple, familiar APIs. Any comments, suggestions or bug reports are hugely appreciated!

                    <span>Hey everybody --- I know this isn&#x27;t hard core AI research but I have been thinking a lot about deep learning and gaming recently and put together a little presentation on how I see things unfolding. Lots of cool research featured in the video.
 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;JDL8rZzYVwQ
 I go over:
  
Photorealistic neural rendering
 Deepfakes for gaming (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;RR7u11ANDWE is a better example than the obama one I used)
 GAN theft auto and dreaming up game engines with neural networks
 Large language models for building realistic NPCs and storytelling
 Using OpenAI Codex to automatically program games.
  
It&#x27;s really clear that deep learning is the most important technology to impact gaming since the advent of 3D graphics. Would love to talk with anybody who is working on stuff in this space.

                    <span>Hi everyone, I&#x27;m looking for a model which can perform style transfer, but also takes an auxiliary noise vector similar to that for StyleGAN to generate many stylized images for a single input image. Is anyone aware of any model meeting these requirements? My best idea so far is to first embed the image into the StyleGAN latent space with this paper, and then add noise to that vector.

                    <span>Special machine learning street talk episode! Yann LeCun thinks that it&#x27;s specious to say neural network models are interpolating because in high dimensions, everything is extrapolation. Recently Dr. Randall Balestriero, Dr. Jerome Pesente and prof. Yann LeCun released their paper learning in high dimensions always amounts to extrapolation. This discussion has completely changed how we think about neural networks and their behaviour. 
 In the intro we talk about the spline theory of NNs, interpolation in NNs and the curse of dimensionality.

                    <span>I have a (personal) ML project that uses CNNs but I have two little problems: 1. not everyone has a NVidia GPU at home (myself included, sadly); 2. The CNN needs to be trained every time it is used (it&#x27;s photo to photo style transfer).
 So, what would be a good framework to implement the CNN for training (targeting desktop only)? I thought about using OpenGL, but I don&#x27;t know if using GLSL shaders would be a good fit for it.

                    <span>TL;DR – DagsHub is integrated with Label Studio, and you can now open datasets from Git and DVC remotes, label them and commit labels back, without doing any DevOps. You can also comment on labels, bounding boxes, or any file. Check out the example project, or try out the tutorial.
 Comparing annotations
 Hi r/ML! I&#x27;m one of the creators of DagsHub (https://www.dagshub.com). We help ML practitioners create a central repository for their projects, where they can leverage open-source tools to version datasets and models, track experiments, and starting today – label data, and comment on anything. Like GitHub for machine learning (you probably heard that before, but we mean it).
 Our vision is that anyone could jump into an open-source data science project and contribute code, data, labeling,…</span>

 I was just reading this paper and was wondering if we just want to achieve a compact version of the original representation we could just use a traditional AutoEncoder. Is there any specific reason the VAE is used?
 Thanks!

 i&#x27;m a PhD student interested in audio spoofs (voice recordings faked with the help of AI), and have developed an online game: You play against an artificial intelligence and try to distinguish spoofed from real audio recordings.
 It&#x27;s fun, and very much supports my research. All partificpation (i.e. playing the game), comments or suggestions are welcome!

                    <span>Hey everyone! I’m one of the creators of Sieve, and I’m excited to be sharing it!
 Sieve is an API that helps you store, process, and automatically search your video data–instantly and efficiently. Just think 10 cameras recording footage at 30 FPS, 24/7. That would be 27 million frames generated in a single day. The videos might be searchable by timestamp, but finding moments of interest is like searching for a needle in a haystack.
 We built this visual demo (link here) a little while back which we’d love to get feedback on. It’s ~24 hours of security footage that our API processed in &lt;10 mins and has simple querying and export functionality enabled. We see applications in better understanding what data you have, figuring out which data to send to labeling, sampling datasets for training, and building multiple test sets for models by scenario.
 To try it on your videos: https://github.com/Sieve-Data/automatic-video-processing

                    <span>Hi, I have just published my latest medium article. It is a summary of a scientific paper that aims to eliminate the effect of locality which is one of the limitations of CNNs. In this attempt, researchers tried to reform the image semantic segmentation problem then operate a proposed transformer, and finally, introduce three different decoder architectures.
 Please read it and give me your feedback. If you find it interesting, you can share it with others who are interested in ML as well. Also, if you find it helpful, you can follow me on medium to be updated on my forthcoming articles.🙂

In cooperative games, all the agents have a team reward and have different states whereas in stochastic games, all the agents receives individual reward and they have the same state in a particular time step. Can someone help me understand the difference between these two games?

                    <span>Hi, I have a hard time understanding the paper &quot;Learning Continuous Control Policies by Stochastic Value Gradients&quot; (https://arxiv.org/pdf/1510.09142.pdf). 
 So, in my understanding is that the stochastic value gradient could be computed easily on imagined (&quot;planned&quot;) data, where we rollout the policy in the learned world model. However, this seems undesirable due to compounding model errors. So far, so good.
 The above issue is fixed when we use real environment samples, although the noise variables η and ξ required to calculate the stochastic value gradient are then unknown. The paper then applies the Bayes rule to reformulate the stochastic value gradient to a tractable formulation.
 My issue: to compute the stochastic value gradient, the noise variables must be inferred. On this issue, the paper simply states &quot;... infer the missing noise variables, possibly by sampling from p(η,ξ|s, a, s′)&quot;. How can we sample these noise variables? How can we infer the noise variables?
 Any help would be greatly appreciated!

 i&#x27;m pretty new to this kind of learning task and i found hard to understand some base concepts. I&#x27;m studying the Decision Transformer paper and for an university problem i need to train that model using the MiniWorld environment.
 While i was looking at the code that is provided by the author of MiniWorld i got a question. How i get training data? 
 The authors of Decision Transformer uses d4rl that provide some offline dataset. How can create training data in a similar way using my environment?

                    <span>Hello :D,
 I had a PPO implementation with convolutional neural networks that worked just fine with discrete action space (environment is a grid world where an agent has 4 possible actions&#x3D;directions). I took the same implementation and switched to continuous action space (2 actions &#x3D; force over x and y axis). The model does pretty well in the first 7mil steps (reward converges), but then the reward suddenly goes down. 
 Any idea what could be the reason? could it be the decaying variance I am using for the continuous action selection?

                    <span>The rapid growth of data in the recent years has led to the development of
complex learning algorithms that are often used to make decisions in real
world. While the positive impact of the algorithms has been tremendous, there
is a need to mitigate any bias arising from either training samples or implicit
assumptions made about the data samples. This need becomes critical when
algorithms are used in automated decision making systems that can hugely impact
people&#x27;s lives.

Many approaches have been proposed to make learning algorithms fair by
detecting and mitigating bias in different stages of optimization. However, due
to a lack of a universal definition of fairness, these algorithms optimize for
a particular interpretation of fairness which makes them limited for real world
use. Moreover, an underlying assumption that is common to all algorithms is the
apparent equivalence of achieving fairness and removing bias. In other words,
there is no user defined criteria that can be incorporated into the
optimization procedure for producing a fair algorithm. Motivated by these
shortcomings of existing methods, we propose the CONFAIR procedure that
produces a fair algorithm by incorporating user constraints into the
optimization procedure. Furthermore, we make the process interpretable by
estimating the most predictive features from data. We demonstrate the efficacy
of our approach on several real world datasets using different fairness
criteria.</span>

                    <span>In this paper, we introduce ML-Decoder, a new attention-based classification
head. ML-Decoder predicts the existence of class labels via queries, and
enables better utilization of spatial data compared to global average pooling.
By redesigning the decoder architecture, and using a novel group-decoding
scheme, ML-Decoder is highly efficient, and can scale well to thousands of
classes. Compared to using a larger backbone, ML-Decoder consistently provides
a better speed-accuracy trade-off. ML-Decoder is also versatile - it can be
used as a drop-in replacement for various classification heads, and generalize
to unseen classes when operated with word queries. Novel query augmentations
further improve its generalization ability. Using ML-Decoder, we achieve
state-of-the-art results on several classification tasks: on MS-COCO
multi-label, we reach 91.4% mAP; on NUS-WIDE zero-shot, we reach 31.1% ZSL mAP;
and on ImageNet single-label, we reach with vanilla ResNet50 backbone a new top
score of 80.7%, without extra data or distillation. Public code is available

                    <span>Reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms assume that users specify tasks by
manually writing down a reward function. However, this process can be laborious
and demands considerable technical expertise. Can we devise RL algorithms that
instead enable users to specify tasks simply by providing examples of
successful outcomes? In this paper, we derive a control algorithm that
maximizes the future probability of these successful outcome examples. Prior
work has approached similar problems with a two-stage process, first learning a
reward function and then optimizing this reward function using another RL
algorithm. In contrast, our method directly learns a value function from
transitions and successful outcomes, without learning this intermediate reward
function. Our method therefore requires fewer hyperparameters to tune and lines
of code to debug. We show that our method satisfies a new data-driven Bellman
equation, where examples take the place of the typical reward function term.
Experiments show that our approach outperforms prior methods that learn
explicit reward functions.</span>

                    <span>There has been an emerging paradigm shift from the era of &quot;internet AI&quot; to
&quot;embodied AI&quot;, where AI algorithms and agents no longer learn from datasets of
images, videos or text curated primarily from the internet. Instead, they learn
through interactions with their environments from an egocentric perception
similar to humans. Consequently, there has been substantial growth in the
demand for embodied AI simulators to support various embodied AI research
tasks. This growing interest in embodied AI is beneficial to the greater
pursuit of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), but there has not been a
contemporary and comprehensive survey of this field. This paper aims to provide
an encyclopedic survey for the field of embodied AI, from its simulators to its
research. By evaluating nine current embodied AI simulators with our proposed
seven features, this paper aims to understand the simulators in their provision
for use in embodied AI research and their limitations. Lastly, this paper
surveys the three main research tasks in embodied AI -- visual exploration,
visual navigation and embodied question answering (QA), covering the
state-of-the-art approaches, evaluation metrics and datasets. Finally, with the
new insights revealed through surveying the field, the paper will provide
suggestions for simulator-for-task selections and recommendations for the
future directions of the field.</span>

                    <span>We present a simple and intuitive approach for interactive control of
physically simulated characters. Our work builds upon generative adversarial
networks (GAN) and reinforcement learning, and introduces an imitation learning
framework where an ensemble of classifiers and an imitation policy are trained
in tandem given pre-processed reference clips. The classifiers are trained to
discriminate the reference motion from the motion generated by the imitation
policy, while the policy is rewarded for fooling the discriminators. Using our
GAN-based approach, multiple motor control policies can be trained separately
to imitate different behaviors. In runtime, our system can respond to external
control signal provided by the user and interactively switch between different
policies. Compared to existing methods, our proposed approach has the following
attractive properties: 1) achieves state-of-the-art imitation performance
without manually designing and fine tuning a reward function; 2) directly
controls the character without having to track any target reference pose
explicitly or implicitly through a phase state; and 3) supports interactive
policy switching without requiring any motion generation or motion matching
mechanism. We highlight the applicability of our approach in a range of
imitation and interactive control tasks, while also demonstrating its ability
to withstand external perturbations as well as to recover balance. Overall, our
approach generates high-fidelity motion, has low runtime cost, and can be
easily integrated into interactive applications and games.</span>

for generalized data in Banach spaces including representer theorems and
convergence theorems. The generalized data are composed of linear functionals
and real scalars as the input and output elements to represent the discrete
information of different local models. By the extension of the classical
machine learning, the empirical risks are computed by the generalized data and
the loss functions. According to the techniques of regularization, the exact
solutions are approximated globally by minimizing the regularized empirical
risks over the Banach spaces. The existence and convergence of the approximate
solutions are guaranteed by the relative compactness of the generalized input
data in the predual spaces of the Banach spaces.</span>

                    <span>Supervision for image-to-image translation (I2I) tasks is hard to come by,
but bears significant effect on the resulting quality. In this paper, we
observe that for many Unsupervised I2I (UI2I) scenarios, one domain is more
familiar than the other, and offers in-domain prior knowledge, such as semantic
segmentation. We argue that for complex scenes, figuring out the semantic
structure of the domain is hard, especially with no supervision, but is an
important part of a successful I2I operation. We hence introduce two techniques
to incorporate this invaluable in-domain prior knowledge for the benefit of
translation quality: through a novel Multi-Stream generator architecture, and
through a semantic segmentation-based regularization loss term. In essence, we
propose splitting the input data according to semantic masks, explicitly
guiding the network to different behavior for the different regions of the
image. In addition, we propose training a semantic segmentation network along
with the translation task, and to leverage this output as a loss term that
improves robustness. We validate our approach on urban data, demonstrating
superior quality in the challenging UI2I tasks of converting day images to
night ones. In addition, we also demonstrate how reinforcing the target dataset
with our augmented images improves the training of downstream tasks such as the
classical detection one.</span>

have achieved scalable Gaussian process inference with highly accurate point

struggle with numerical instabilities in learning kernel hyperparameters, and
poor test likelihoods. By investigating CG tolerance, preconditioner rank, and
Lanczos decomposition rank, we provide a particularly simple prescription to
correct these issues: we recommend that one should use a small CG tolerance
($\epsilon \leq 0.01$) and a large root decomposition size ($r \geq 5000$).
Moreover, we show that L-BFGS-B is a compelling optimizer for Iterative GPs,
achieving convergence with fewer gradient updates.</span>

contract papers, historic texts are widely used nowadays. These document images
could be degraded or damaged due to various reasons including poor lighting
conditions, shadow, distortions like noise and blur, aging, ink stain,
bleed-through, watermark, stamp, etc. Document image enhancement plays a
crucial role as a pre-processing step in many automated document analysis and
recognition tasks such as character recognition. With recent advances in deep
learning, many methods are proposed to enhance the quality of these document
images. In this paper, we review deep learning-based methods, datasets, and

debluring, denoising, defading, watermark removal, and shadow removal. We
summarize the recent works for each task and discuss their features,
challenges, and limitations. We introduce multiple document image enhancement

several promising research directions and opportunities for future research.</span>

                    <span>We consider the data-driven discovery of governing equations from time-series
data in the limit of high noise. The algorithms developed describe an extensive
toolkit of methods for circumventing the deleterious effects of noise in the
context of the sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics (SINDy) framework.
We offer two primary contributions, both focused on noisy data acquired from a
system x&#x27; &#x3D; f(x). First, we propose, for use in high-noise settings, an
extensive toolkit of critically enabling extensions for the SINDy regression
method, to progressively cull functionals from an over-complete library and
yield a set of sparse equations that regress to the derivate x&#x27;. These
innovations can extract sparse governing equations and coefficients from
high-noise time-series data (e.g. 300% added noise). For example, it discovers
the correct sparse libraries in the Lorenz system, with median coefficient
estimate errors equal to 1% - 3% (for 50% noise), 6% - 8% (for 100% noise); and
23% - 25% (for 300% noise). The enabling modules in the toolkit are combined
into a single method, but the individual modules can be tactically applied in
other equation discovery methods (SINDy or not) to improve results on
high-noise data. Second, we propose a technique, applicable to any model
discovery method based on x&#x27; &#x3D; f(x), to assess the accuracy of a discovered
model in the context of non-unique solutions due to noisy data. Currently, this
non-uniqueness can obscure a discovered model&#x27;s accuracy and thus a discovery
method&#x27;s effectiveness. We describe a technique that uses linear dependencies
among functionals to transform a discovered model into an equivalent form that
is closest to the true model, enabling more accurate assessment of a discovered
model&#x27;s accuracy.</span>

                    <span>Bayesian models of behavior have provided computational level explanations in
a range of psychophysical tasks. One fundamental experimental paradigm is the
production or reproduction task, in which subjects are instructed to generate
an action that either reproduces a previously sensed stimulus magnitude or
achieves a target response. This type of task therefore distinguishes itself
from other psychophysical tasks in that the responses are on a continuum and
effort plays an important role with increasing response magnitude. Based on
Bayesian decision theory we present an inference method to recover perceptual
uncertainty, response variability, and the cost function underlying human
responses. Crucially, the cost function is parameterized such that effort is
explicitly included. We present a hybrid inference method employing MCMC
sampling utilizing appropriate proposal distributions and an inner loop
utilizing amortized inference with a neural network that approximates the mode
of the optimal response distribution. We show how this model can be utilized to
avoid unidentifiability of experimental designs and that parameters can be
recovered through validation on synthetic and application to experimental data.
Our approach will enable behavioral scientists to perform Bayesian inference of
decision making parameters in production and reproduction tasks.</span>

                    <span>The celebrated Takens&#x27; embedding theorem concerns embedding an attractor of a
dynamical system in a Euclidean space of appropriate dimension through a
generic delay-observation map. The embedding also establishes a topological
conjugacy. In this paper, we show how an arbitrary sequence can be mapped into
another space as an attractive solution of a nonautonomous dynamical system.
Such mapping also entails a topological conjugacy and an embedding between the
sequence and the attractive solution spaces. This result is not a
generalization of Takens embedding theorem but helps us understand what exactly
is required by discrete-time state space models widely used in applications to
embed an external stimulus onto its solution space. Our results settle another
basic problem concerning the perturbation of an autonomous dynamical system. We
describe what exactly happens to the dynamics when exogenous noise perturbs
continuously a local irreducible attracting set (such as a stable fixed point)
of a discrete-time autonomous dynamical system.</span>

                    <span>The H-measure is a classifier performance measure which takes into account
the context of application without requiring a rigid value of relative
misclassification costs to be set. Since its introduction in 2009 it has become
widely adopted. This paper answers various queries which users have raised
since its introduction, including questions about its interpretation, the
choice of a weighting function, whether it is strictly proper, and its
coherence, and relates the measure to other work.</span>

                    <span>Partial differential equations (PDEs) play a dominant role in the
mathematical modeling of many complex dynamical processes. Solving these PDEs
often requires prohibitively high computational costs, especially when multiple
evaluations must be made for different parameters or conditions. After
training, neural operators can provide PDEs solutions significantly faster than
traditional PDE solvers. In this work, invariance properties and computational
complexity of two neural operators are examined for transport PDE of a scalar
quantity. Neural operator based on graph kernel network (GKN) operates on
graph-structured data to incorporate nonlocal dependencies. Here we propose a
modified formulation of GKN to achieve frame invariance. Vector cloud neural
network (VCNN) is an alternate neural operator with embedded frame invariance
which operates on point cloud data. GKN-based neural operator demonstrates
slightly better predictive performance compared to VCNN. However, GKN requires
an excessively high computational cost that increases quadratically with the
increasing number of discretized objects as compared to a linear increase for
VCNN.</span>

                    <span>Federated edge learning (FEEL) has emerged as an effective approach to reduce
the large communication latency in Cloud-based machine learning solutions,
while preserving data privacy. Unfortunately, the learning performance of FEEL
may be compromised due to limited training data in a single edge cluster. In
this paper, we investigate a novel framework of FEEL, namely semi-decentralized
federated edge learning (SD-FEEL). By allowing model aggregation across
different edge clusters, SD-FEEL enjoys the benefit of FEEL in reducing the
training latency, while improving the learning performance by accessing richer
training data from multiple edge clusters. A training algorithm for SD-FEEL
with three main procedures in each round is presented, including local model
updates, intra-cluster and inter-cluster model aggregations, which is proved to
converge on non-independent and identically distributed (non-IID) data. We also
characterize the interplay between the network topology of the edge servers and
the communication overhead of inter-cluster model aggregation on the training
performance. Experiment results corroborate our analysis and demonstrate the
effectiveness of SD-FFEL in achieving faster convergence than traditional
federated learning architectures. Besides, guidelines on choosing critical
hyper-parameters of the training algorithm are also provided.</span>

                    <span>We present a unified analysis method that relies on the generalized cosine
rule and $\phi$-convex for online optimization in normed vector space using
dynamic regret as the performance metric. In combing the update rules, we start
with strategy $S$ (a two-parameter variant strategy covering Optimistic-FTRL
with surrogate linearized losses), and obtain $S$-I (type-I relaxation variant
form of $S$) and $S$-II (type-II relaxation variant form of $S$, which is
Optimistic-MD) by relaxation. Regret bounds for $S$-I and $S$-II are the
tightest possible. As instantiations, regret bounds of normalized exponentiated
subgradient and greedy/lazy projection are better than the currently known
optimal results. By replacing losses of online game with monotone operators,
and extending the definition of regret, namely regret$^n$, we extend online
convex optimization to online monotone optimization, which expands the
application scope of $S$-I and $S$-II.</span>

                    <span>Approximate message passing (AMP) is a promising technique for unknown signal
reconstruction of certain high-dimensional linear systems with non-Gaussian
signaling. A distinguished feature of the AMP-type algorithms is that their
dynamics can be rigorously described by state evolution. However, state
evolution does not necessarily guarantee the convergence of iterative
algorithms. To solve the convergence problem of AMP-type algorithms in
principle, this paper proposes a memory AMP (MAMP) under a sufficient statistic
condition, named sufficient statistic MAMP (SS-MAMP). We show that the
covariance matrices of SS-MAMP are L-banded and convergent. Given an arbitrary
MAMP, we can construct an SS-MAMP by damping, which not only ensures the
convergence of MAMP but also preserves the orthogonality of MAMP, i.e., its
dynamics can be rigorously described by state evolution. As a byproduct, we
prove that the Bayes-optimal orthogonal/vector AMP (BO-OAMP/VAMP) is an
SS-MAMP. As a result, we reveal two interesting properties of BO-OAMP/VAMP for
large systems: 1) the covariance matrices are L-banded and are convergent in
BO-OAMP/VAMP, and 2) damping and memory are useless (i.e., do not bring
performance improvement) in BO-OAMP/VAMP. As an example, we construct a
sufficient statistic Bayes-optimal MAMP (BO-MAMP), which is Bayes optimal if
its state evolution has a unique fixed point and its MSE is not worse than the
original BO-MAMP. Finally, simulations are provided to verify the validity and
accuracy of the theoretical results.</span>

                    <span>Optimal transport (OT) and its entropy regularized offspring have recently
gained a lot of attention in both machine learning and AI domains. In
particular, optimal transport has been used to develop probability metrics
between probability distributions. We introduce in this paper an independence
criterion based on entropy regularized optimal transport. Our criterion can be
used to test for independence between two samples. We establish non-asymptotic
bounds for our test statistic, and study its statistical behavior under both
the null and alternative hypothesis. Our theoretical results involve tools from
U-process theory and optimal transport theory. We present experimental results
on existing benchmarks, illustrating the interest of the proposed criterion.</span>

                    <span>The gradient noise of Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) is considered to play
a key role in its properties (e.g. escaping low potential points and
regularization). Past research has indicated that the covariance of the SGD
error done via minibatching plays a critical role in determining its
regularization and escape from low potential points. It is however not much
explored how much the distribution of the error influences the behavior of the
algorithm. Motivated by some new research in this area, we prove universality
results by showing that noise classes that have the same mean and covariance
structure of SGD via minibatching have similar properties. We mainly consider
the Multiplicative Stochastic Gradient Descent (M-SGD) algorithm as introduced
by Wu et al., which has a much more general noise class than the SGD algorithm
done via minibatching. We establish nonasymptotic bounds for the M-SGD
algorithm mainly with respect to the Stochastic Differential Equation
corresponding to SGD via minibatching. We also show that the M-SGD error is
approximately a scaled Gaussian distribution with mean $0$ at any fixed point
of the M-SGD algorithm. We also establish bounds for the convergence of the
M-SGD algorithm in the strongly convex regime.</span>

                    <span>The importance of deep learning data privacy has gained significant attention
in recent years. It is probably to suffer data breaches when applying deep
learning to cryptocurrency that lacks supervision of financial regulatory
agencies. However, there is little relative research in the financial area to
our best knowledge. We apply two representative deep learning privacy-privacy
frameworks proposed by Google to financial trading data. We designed the
experiments with several different parameters suggested from the original
studies. In addition, we refer the degree of privacy to Google and Apple
companies to estimate the results more reasonably. The results show that DP-SGD
performs better than the PATE framework in financial trading data. The tradeoff
between privacy and accuracy is low in DP-SGD. The degree of privacy also is in
line with the actual case. Therefore, we can obtain a strong privacy guarantee
with precision to avoid potential financial loss.</span>

                    <span>Score-based generative models (SGMs) have demonstrated remarkable synthesis
quality. SGMs rely on a diffusion process that gradually perturbs the data
towards a tractable distribution, while the generative model learns to denoise.
The complexity of this denoising task is, apart from the data distribution
itself, uniquely determined by the diffusion process. We argue that current
SGMs employ overly simplistic diffusions, leading to unnecessarily complex
denoising processes, which limit generative modeling performance. Based on
connections to statistical mechanics, we propose a novel critically-damped
Langevin diffusion (CLD) and show that CLD-based SGMs achieve superior
performance. CLD can be interpreted as running a joint diffusion in an extended
space, where the auxiliary variables can be considered &quot;velocities&quot; that are
coupled to the data variables as in Hamiltonian dynamics. We derive a novel
score matching objective for CLD and show that the model only needs to learn
the score function of the conditional distribution of the velocity given data,
an easier task than learning scores of the data directly. We also derive a new
sampling scheme for efficient synthesis from CLD-based diffusion models. We
find that CLD outperforms previous SGMs in synthesis quality for similar
network architectures and sampling compute budgets. We show that our novel
sampler for CLD significantly outperforms solvers such as Euler--Maruyama. Our
framework provides new insights into score-based denoising diffusion models and
can be readily used for high-resolution image synthesis. Project page and code:

                    <span>Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are acknowledged as vulnerable to adversarial
attacks, while the existing black-box attacks require extensive queries on the
victim DNN to achieve high success rates. For query-efficiency, surrogate
models of the victim are used to generate transferable Adversarial Examples
(AEs) because of their Gradient Similarity (GS), i.e., surrogates&#x27; attack
gradients are similar to the victim&#x27;s ones. However, it is generally neglected
to exploit their similarity on outputs, namely the Prediction Similarity (PS),
to filter out inefficient queries by surrogates without querying the victim. To
jointly utilize and also optimize surrogates&#x27; GS and PS, we develop QueryNet, a
unified attack framework that can significantly reduce queries. QueryNet
creatively attacks by multi-identity surrogates, i.e., crafts several AEs for
one sample by different surrogates, and also uses surrogates to decide on the
most promising AE for the query. After that, the victim&#x27;s query feedback is
accumulated to optimize not only surrogates&#x27; parameters but also their
architectures, enhancing both the GS and the PS. Although QueryNet has no
access to pre-trained surrogates&#x27; prior, it reduces queries by averagely about
an order of magnitude compared to alternatives within an acceptable time,
according to our comprehensive experiments: 11 victims (including two
commercial models) on MNIST/CIFAR10/ImageNet, allowing only 8-bit image

disentanglement remains difficult to find. Here we investigate the original

                    <span>The statefulness property of network protocol implementations poses a unique
challenge for testing and verification techniques, including Fuzzing. Stateful
fuzzers tackle this challenge by leveraging state models to partition the state
space and assist the test generation process. Since not all states are equally
important and fuzzing campaigns have time limits, fuzzers need effective state
selection algorithms to prioritize progressive states over others. Several
state selection algorithms have been proposed but they were implemented and
evaluated separately on different platforms, making it hard to achieve
conclusive findings. In this work, we evaluate an extensive set of state
selection algorithms on the same fuzzing platform that is AFLNet, a
state-of-the-art fuzzer for network servers. The algorithm set includes

AFLNetLegion. The experimental results on the ProFuzzBench benchmark show that
(i) the existing state selection algorithms of AFLNet achieve very similar code
coverage, (ii) AFLNetLegion clearly outperforms these algorithms in selected

                    <span>The latest advances of statistical physics have shown remarkable performance
of machine learning in identifying phase transitions. In this paper, we apply
domain adversarial neural network (DANN) based on transfer learning to studying
non-equilibrium and equilibrium phase transition models, which are percolation
model and directed percolation (DP) model, respectively. With the DANN, only a
small fraction of input configurations (2d images) needs to be labeled, which
is automatically chosen, in order to capture the critical point. To learn the
DP model, the method is refined by an iterative procedure in determining the
critical point, which is a prerequisite for the data collapse in calculating
the critical exponent $\nu_{\perp}$. We then apply the DANN to a
two-dimensional site percolation with configurations filtered to include only
the largest cluster which may contain the information related to the order
parameter. The DANN learning of both models yields reliable results which are
comparable to the ones from Monte Carlo simulations. Our study also shows that
the DANN can achieve quite high accuracy at much lower cost, compared to the
supervised learning.</span>

                    <span>Continual learning requires models to learn new tasks while maintaining
previously learned knowledge. Various algorithms have been proposed to address
this real challenge. Till now, rehearsal-based methods, such as experience
replay, have achieved state-of-the-art performance. These approaches save a
small part of the data of the past tasks as a memory buffer to prevent models
from forgetting previously learned knowledge. However, most of them treat every
new task equally, i.e., fixed the hyperparameters of the framework while
learning different new tasks. Such a setting lacks the consideration of the
relationship/similarity between past and new tasks. For example, the previous
knowledge/features learned from dogs are more beneficial for the identification
of cats (new task), compared to those learned from buses. In this regard, we
propose a meta learning algorithm based on bi-level optimization to adaptively
tune the relationship between the knowledge extracted from the past and new
tasks. Therefore, the model can find an appropriate direction of gradient
during continual learning and avoid the serious overfitting problem on memory
buffer. Extensive experiments are conducted on three publicly available
datasets (i.e., CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and Tiny ImageNet). The experimental
results demonstrate that the proposed method can consistently improve the
performance of all baselines.</span>

                    <span>A trivializing map is a field transformation whose Jacobian determinant
exactly cancels the interaction terms in the action, providing a representation
of the theory in terms of a deterministic transformation of a distribution from
which sampling is trivial. Recently, a proof-of-principle study by Albergo,
Kanwar and Shanahan [arXiv:1904.12072] demonstrated that approximations of
trivializing maps can be &#x60;machine-learned&#x27; by a class of invertible,
differentiable neural models called \textit{normalizing flows}. By ensuring
that the Jacobian determinant can be computed efficiently, asymptotically exact
sampling from the theory of interest can be performed by drawing samples from a
simple distribution and passing them through the network. From a theoretical
perspective, this approach has the potential to become more efficient than
traditional Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampling techniques, where
autocorrelations severely diminish the sampling efficiency as one approaches
the continuum limit. A major caveat is that it is not yet understood how the
size of models and the cost of training them is expected to scale. As a first
step, we have conducted an exploratory scaling study using two-dimensional
$\phi^4$ with up to $20^2$ lattice sites. Although the scope of our study is
limited to a particular model architecture and training algorithm, initial
results paint an interesting picture in which training costs grow very quickly
indeed. We describe a candidate explanation for the poor scaling, and outline
our intentions to clarify the situation in future work.</span>

                    <span>Large-scale datasets are important for the development of deep learning
models. Such datasets usually require a heavy workload of annotations, which
are extremely time-consuming and expensive. To accelerate the annotation
procedure, multiple annotators may be employed to label different subsets of
the data. However, the inconsistency and bias among different annotators are
harmful to the model training, especially for qualitative and subjective
tasks.To address this challenge, in this paper, we propose a novel contrastive
regression framework to address the disjoint annotations problem, where each
sample is labeled by only one annotator and multiple annotators work on
disjoint subsets of the data. To take account of both the intra-annotator
consistency and inter-annotator inconsistency, two strategies are
employed.Firstly, a contrastive-based loss is applied to learn the relative
ranking among different samples of the same annotator, with the assumption that
the ranking of samples from the same annotator is unanimous. Secondly, we apply
the gradient reversal layer to learn robust representations that are invariant
to different annotators. Experiments on the facial expression prediction task,
as well as the image quality assessment task, verify the effectiveness of our
proposed framework.</span>

                    <span>A long standing problem in the modeling of non-Newtonian hydrodynamics is the
availability of reliable and interpretable hydrodynamic models that faithfully
encode the underlying micro-scale polymer dynamics. The main complication
arises from the long polymer relaxation time, the complex molecular structure,
and heterogeneous interaction. DeePN$^2$, a deep learning-based non-Newtonian
hydrodynamic model, has been proposed and has shown some success in
systematically passing the micro-scale structural mechanics information to the
macro-scale hydrodynamics for suspensions with simple polymer conformation and
bond potential. The model retains a multi-scaled nature by mapping the polymer
configurations into a set of symmetry-preserving macro-scale features. The
extended constitutive laws for these macro-scale features can be directly
learned from the kinetics of their micro-scale counterparts. In this paper, we
carry out further study of DeePN$^2$ using more complex micro-structural
models. We show that DeePN$^2$ can faithfully capture the broadly overlooked
viscoelastic differences arising from the specific molecular structural
mechanics without human intervention.</span>

                    <span>Graph neural network (GNN) has shown convincing performance in learning
powerful node representations that preserve both node attributes and graph
structural information. However, many GNNs encounter problems in effectiveness
and efficiency when they are designed with a deeper network structure or handle
large-sized graphs. Several sampling algorithms have been proposed for
improving and accelerating the training of GNNs, yet they ignore understanding
the source of GNN performance gain. The measurement of information within graph
data can help the sampling algorithms to keep high-value information while
removing redundant information and even noise. In this paper, we propose a
Metric-Guided (MeGuide) subgraph learning framework for GNNs. MeGuide employs
two novel metrics: Feature Smoothness and Connection Failure Distance to guide
the subgraph sampling and mini-batch based training. Feature Smoothness is
designed for analyzing the feature of nodes in order to retain the most
valuable information, while Connection Failure Distance can measure the
structural information to control the size of subgraphs. We demonstrate the
effectiveness and efficiency of MeGuide in training various GNNs on multiple
datasets.</span>

                    <span>One of the reasons that many neural networks are capable of replicating
complicated tasks or functions is their universality property. The past few
decades have seen many attempts in providing constructive proofs for single or
class of neural networks. This paper is an effort to provide a unified and
constructive framework for the universality of a large class of activations
including most of existing activations and beyond. At the heart of the
framework is the concept of neural network approximate identity. It turns out
that most of existing activations are neural network approximate identity, and
thus universal in the space of continuous of functions on compacta. The
framework induces several advantages. First, it is constructive with elementary
means from functional analysis, probability theory, and numerical analysis.
Second, it is the first unified attempt that is valid for most of existing
activations. Third, as a by product, the framework provides the first
university proof for some of the existing activation functions including Mish,
SiLU, ELU, GELU, and etc. Fourth, it discovers new activations with guaranteed
universality property. Indeed, any activation\textemdash whose $\k$th
derivative, with $\k$ being an integer, is integrable and essentially
bounded\textemdash is universal. Fifth, for a given activation and error
tolerance, the framework provides precisely the architecture of the
corresponding one-hidden neural network with predetermined number of neuron,
and the values of weights/biases.</span>

                    <span>For strongly convex objectives that are smooth, the classical theory of
gradient descent ensures linear convergence relative to the number of gradient
evaluations. An analogous nonsmooth theory is challenging: even when the
objective is smooth at every iterate, the corresponding local models are
unstable, and traditional remedies need unpredictably many cutting planes. We
instead propose a multipoint generalization of the gradient descent iteration
for local optimization. While designed with general objectives in mind, we are
motivated by a &quot;max-of-smooth&quot; model that captures subdifferential dimension at
optimality. We prove linear convergence when the objective is itself
max-of-smooth, and experiments suggest a more general phenomenon.</span>

                    <span>Reinforcement learning has recently shown promise in learning quality
solutions in many combinatorial optimization problems. In particular, the
attention-based encoder-decoder models show high effectiveness on various
routing problems, including the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP).
Unfortunately, they perform poorly for the TSP with Drone (TSP-D), requiring
routing a heterogeneous fleet of vehicles in coordination -- a truck and a
drone. In TSP-D, the two vehicles are moving in tandem and may need to wait at
a node for the other vehicle to join. State-less attention-based decoder fails
to make such coordination between vehicles. We propose an attention
encoder-LSTM decoder hybrid model, in which the decoder&#x27;s hidden state can
represent the sequence of actions made. We empirically demonstrate that such a
hybrid model improves upon a purely attention-based model for both solution
quality and computational efficiency. Our experiments on the min-max
Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (mmCVRP) also confirm that the hybrid model
is more suitable for coordinated routing of multiple vehicles than the
attention-based model.</span>

                    <span>Unified understanding of neuro networks (NNs) gets the users into great
trouble because they have been puzzled by what kind of rules should be obeyed
to optimize the internal structure of NNs. Considering the potential capability
of random graphs to alter how computation is performed, we demonstrate that
they can serve as architecture generators to optimize the internal structure of
NNs. To transform the random graph theory into an NN model with practical
meaning and based on clarifying the input-output relationship of each neuron,
we complete data feature mapping by calculating Fourier Random Features (FRFs).
Under the usage of this low-operation cost approach, neurons are assigned to
several groups of which connection relationships can be regarded as uniform
representations of random graphs they belong to, and random arrangement fuses
those neurons to establish the pattern matrix, markedly reducing manual
participation and computational cost without the fixed and deep architecture.
Leveraging this single neuromorphic learning model termed random graph-based
neuro network (RGNN) we develop a joint classification mechanism involving
information interaction between multiple RGNNs and realize significant
performance improvements in supervised learning for three benchmark tasks,
whereby they effectively avoid the adverse impact of the interpretability of
NNs on the structure design and engineering practice.</span>

                    <span>&quot;Benign overfitting&quot;, where classifiers memorize noisy training data yet
still achieve a good generalization performance, has drawn great attention in
the machine learning community. To explain this surprising phenomenon, a series
of works have provided theoretical justification in over-parameterized linear
regression, classification, and kernel methods. However, it is not clear if
benign overfitting still occurs in the presence of adversarial examples, i.e.,
examples with tiny and intentional perturbations to fool the classifiers. In
this paper, we show that benign overfitting indeed occurs in adversarial
training, a principled approach to defend against adversarial examples. In
detail, we prove the risk bounds of the adversarially trained linear classifier
on the mixture of sub-Gaussian data under $\ell_p$ adversarial perturbations.
Our result suggests that under moderate perturbations, adversarially trained
linear classifiers can achieve the near-optimal standard and adversarial risks,
despite overfitting the noisy training data. Numerical experiments validate our
theoretical findings.</span>

technique to improve the generalization of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). Our
method leverages the recent advances in Mixup regularizer for vision and text,
where random sample pairs and their labels are interpolated to create synthetic
samples for training. Unlike images or natural sentences, graphs have arbitrary
structure and topology, and even simply deleting or adding one edge from a
graph can dramatically change its semantic meanings. This makes interpolating
graph inputs very challenging because mixing graph pairs may naturally create
graphs with identical structure but with conflict labels, causing the manifold
intrusion issue. To cope with this obstacle, we propose a simple input mixing
schema for Mixup on graph, coined ifMixup. We theoretically prove that, with a
mild assumption, ifMixup guarantees that the mixed graphs are manifold
intrusion free. We also empirically verify that ifMixup can effectively
regularize the graph classification learning, resulting in superior predictive
accuracy over popular graph augmentation baselines.</span>

                    <span>Realistically -- and equitably -- modeling the dynamics of group-level
disparities in machine learning remains an open problem. In particular, we
desire models that do not suppose inherent differences between artificial
groups of people -- but rather endogenize disparities by appeal to unequal
initial conditions of insular subpopulations. In this paper, agents each have a
real-valued feature $X$ (e.g., credit score) informed by a &quot;true&quot; binary label
$Y$ representing qualification (e.g., for a loan). Each agent alternately (1)
receives a binary classification label $\hat{Y}$ (e.g., loan approval) from a
Bayes-optimal machine learning classifier observing $X$ and (2) may update
their qualification $Y$ by imitating successful strategies (e.g., seek a raise)
within an isolated group $G$ of agents to which they belong. We consider the
disparity of qualification rates $\Pr(Y&#x3D;1)$ between different groups and how
this disparity changes subject to a sequence of Bayes-optimal classifiers
repeatedly retrained on the global population. We model the evolving
qualification rates of each subpopulation (group) using the replicator
equation, which derives from a class of imitation processes. We show that
differences in qualification rates between subpopulations can persist
indefinitely for a set of non-trivial equilibrium states due to uniformed
classifier deployments, even when groups are identical in all aspects except
initial qualification densities. We next simulate the effects of commonly
proposed fairness interventions on this dynamical system along with a new
feedback control mechanism capable of permanently eliminating group-level
qualification rate disparities. We conclude by discussing the limitations of
our model and findings and by outlining potential future work.</span>

                    <span>Identifying anomalies refers to detecting samples that do not resemble the
training data distribution. Many generative models have been used to find
anomalies, and among them, generative adversarial network (GAN)-based
approaches are currently very popular. GANs mainly rely on the rich contextual
information of these models to identify the actual training distribution.
Following this analogy, we suggested a new unsupervised model based on GANs --a
combination of an autoencoder and a GAN. Further, a new scoring function was
introduced to target anomalies where a linear combination of the internal
representation of the discriminator and the generator&#x27;s visual representation,
plus the encoded representation of the autoencoder, come together to define the
proposed anomaly score. The model was further evaluated on benchmark datasets
such as SVHN, CIFAR10, and MNIST, as well as a public medical dataset of
leukemia images. In all the experiments, our model outperformed its existing
counterparts while slightly improving the inference time.</span>

                    <span>We study the model-based reward-free reinforcement learning with linear
function approximation for episodic Markov decision processes (MDPs). In this
setting, the agent works in two phases. In the exploration phase, the agent
interacts with the environment and collects samples without the reward. In the
planning phase, the agent is given a specific reward function and uses samples
collected from the exploration phase to learn a good policy. We propose a new
provably efficient algorithm, called UCRL-RFE under the Linear Mixture MDP
assumption, where the transition probability kernel of the MDP can be
parameterized by a linear function over certain feature mappings defined on the
triplet of state, action, and next state. We show that to obtain an
$\epsilon$-optimal policy for arbitrary reward function, UCRL-RFE needs to
sample at most $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(H^5d^2\epsilon^{-2})$ episodes during the
exploration phase. Here, $H$ is the length of the episode, $d$ is the dimension
of the feature mapping. We also propose a variant of UCRL-RFE using
Bernstein-type bonus and show that it needs to sample at most
$\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(H^4d(H + d)\epsilon^{-2})$ to achieve an
$\epsilon$-optimal policy. By constructing a special class of linear Mixture
MDPs, we also prove that for any reward-free algorithm, it needs to sample at
least $\tilde \Omega(H^2d\epsilon^{-2})$ episodes to obtain an
$\epsilon$-optimal policy. Our upper bound matches the lower bound in terms of
the dependence on $\epsilon$ and the dependence on $d$ if $H \ge d$.</span>

                    <span>Current models on Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) have shown an
evident and quantified lack of reliability for measuring feature-relevance when
statistically entangled features are proposed for training deep classifiers.
There has been an increase in the application of Deep Learning in clinical
trials to predict early diagnosis of neuro-developmental disorders, such as
Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). However, the inclusion of more reliable
saliency-maps to obtain more trustworthy and interpretable metrics using neural
activity features is still insufficiently mature for practical applications in
diagnostics or clinical trials. Moreover, in ASD research the inclusion of deep
classifiers that use neural measures to predict viewed facial emotions is
relatively unexplored. Therefore, in this study we propose the evaluation of a
Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for electroencephalography (EEG)-based
facial emotion recognition decoding complemented with a novel
RemOve-And-Retrain (ROAR) methodology to recover highly relevant features used
in the classifier. Specifically, we compare well-known relevance maps such as
Layer-Wise Relevance Propagation (LRP), PatternNet, Pattern-Attribution, and
Smooth-Grad Squared. This study is the first to consolidate a more transparent
feature-relevance calculation for a successful EEG-based facial emotion
recognition using a within-subject-trained CNN in typically-developed and ASD

                    <span>Bayesian optimization has proven to be an efficient method to optimize
expensive-to-evaluate systems. However, depending on the cost of single
observations, multi-dimensional optimizations of one or more objectives may
still be prohibitively expensive. Multi-fidelity optimization remedies this
issue by including multiple, cheaper information sources such as low-resolution
approximations in numerical simulations. Acquisition functions for
multi-fidelity optimization are typically based on exploration-heavy algorithms
that are difficult to combine with optimization towards multiple objectives.

Here we show that the expected hypervolume improvement policy can act in many
situations as a suitable substitute. We incorporate the evaluation cost either
via a two-step evaluation or within a single acquisition function with an
additional fidelity-related objective. This permits simultaneous
multi-objective and multi-fidelity optimization, which allows to accurately
establish the Pareto set and front at fractional cost. Benchmarks show a cost
reduction of an order of magnitude or more. Our method thus allows for Pareto
optimization of extremely expansive black-box functions.

The presented methods are simple and straightforward to implement in
existing, optimized Bayesian optimization frameworks and can immediately be
extended to batch optimization. The techniques can also be used to combine
different continuous and/or discrete fidelity dimensions, which makes them
particularly relevant for simulation problems in plasma physics, fluid dynamics
and many other branches of scientific computing.</span>

                    <span>Scene Graph Generation (SGG) remains a challenging visual understanding task
due to its complex compositional property. Most previous works adopt a
bottom-up two-stage or a point-based one-stage approach, which often suffers
from overhead time complexity or sub-optimal design assumption. In this work,
we propose a novel SGG method to address the aforementioned issues, which
formulates the task as a bipartite graph construction problem. To solve the
problem, we develop a transformer-based end-to-end framework that first
generates the entity and predicate proposal set, followed by inferring directed
edges to form the relation triplets. In particular, we develop a new
entity-aware predicate representation based on a structural predicate generator
to leverage the compositional property of relationships. Moreover, we design a
graph assembling module to infer the connectivity of the bipartite scene graph
based on our entity-aware structure, enabling us to generate the scene graph in
an end-to-end manner. Extensive experimental results show that our design is
able to achieve the state-of-the-art or comparable performance on two
challenging benchmarks, surpassing most of the existing approaches and enjoying
higher efficiency in inference. We hope our model can serve as a strong
baseline for the Transformer-based scene graph generation.</span>

                    <span>Thompson Sampling (TS) is one of the most effective algorithms for solving
contextual multi-armed bandit problems. In this paper, we propose a new
algorithm, called Neural Thompson Sampling, which adapts deep neural networks
for both exploration and exploitation. At the core of our algorithm is a novel
posterior distribution of the reward, where its mean is the neural network
approximator, and its variance is built upon the neural tangent features of the
corresponding neural network. We prove that, provided the underlying reward
function is bounded, the proposed algorithm is guaranteed to achieve a
cumulative regret of $\mathcal{O}(T^{1/2})$, which matches the regret of other
contextual bandit algorithms in terms of total round number $T$. Experimental
comparisons with other benchmark bandit algorithms on various data sets
corroborate our theory.</span>

transform (DWT) and Machine learning classifiers. Here DWT has been used for
feature extraction as it provides a better decomposition of the signals in
different frequency bands. At first, DWT has been applied to the EEG signal to
extract the detail and approximate coefficients or different sub-bands. After
the extraction of the coefficients, principal component analysis (PCA) has been
applied on different sub-bands and then a feature level fusion technique is
used to extract the important features in low dimensional feature space. Three

                    <span>Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have achieved remarkable success in
automatically segmenting organs or lesions on 3D medical images. Recently,
vision transformer networks have exhibited exceptional performance in 2D image
classification tasks. Compared with CNNs, transformer networks have an
appealing advantage of extracting long-range features due to their

                    <span>Deep Reinforcement Learning (RL) is a powerful framework for solving complex
real-world problems. Large neural networks employed in the framework are
traditionally associated with better generalization capabilities, but their
increased size entails the drawbacks of extensive training duration,
substantial hardware resources, and longer inference times. One way to tackle
this problem is to prune neural networks leaving only the necessary parameters.
State-of-the-art concurrent pruning techniques for imposing sparsity perform
demonstrably well in applications where data distributions are fixed. However,
they have not yet been substantially explored in the context of RL. We close
the gap between RL and single-shot pruning techniques and present a general
pruning approach to the Offline RL. We leverage a fixed dataset to prune neural
networks before the start of RL training. We then run experiments varying the
network sparsity level and evaluating the validity of pruning at initialization
techniques in continuous control tasks. Our results show that with 95% of the
network weights pruned, Offline-RL algorithms can still retain performance in
the majority of our experiments. To the best of our knowledge, no prior work
utilizing pruning in RL retained performance at such high levels of sparsity.

Moreover, pruning at initialization techniques can be easily integrated into
any existing Offline-RL algorithms without changing the learning objective.</span>

                    <span>Sampling from an unnormalized probability distribution is a fundamental
problem in machine learning with applications including Bayesian modeling,
latent factor inference, and energy-based model training. After decades of
research, variations of MCMC remain the default approach to sampling despite
slow convergence. Auxiliary neural models can learn to speed up MCMC, but the
overhead for training the extra model can be prohibitive. We propose a
fundamentally different approach to this problem via a new Hamiltonian dynamics
with a non-Newtonian momentum. In contrast to MCMC approaches like Hamiltonian
Monte Carlo, no stochastic step is required. Instead, the proposed
deterministic dynamics in an extended state space exactly sample the target
distribution, specified by an energy function, under an assumption of
ergodicity. Alternatively, the dynamics can be interpreted as a normalizing
flow that samples a specified energy model without training. The proposed
Energy Sampling Hamiltonian (ESH) dynamics have a simple form that can be
solved with existing ODE solvers, but we derive a specialized solver that
exhibits much better performance. ESH dynamics converge faster than their MCMC
competitors enabling faster, more stable training of neural network energy
models.</span>

contrastive learning from a clustering perspective, CARL learns unsupervised
representations by learning a set of general prototypes that serve as energy
anchors to enforce different views of a given image to be assigned to the same
prototype. Unlike contemporary work on contrastive learning with deep
clustering, CARL proposes to learn the set of general prototypes in an online
fashion, using gradient descent without the necessity of using

                    <span>The effectiveness of traditional traffic prediction methods is often
extremely limited when forecasting traffic dynamics in early morning. The
reason is that traffic can break down drastically during the early morning
commute, and the time and duration of this break-down vary substantially from
day to day. Early morning traffic forecast is crucial to inform morning-commute
traffic management, but they are generally challenging to predict in advance,
particularly by midnight. In this paper, we propose to mine Twitter messages as
a probing method to understand the impacts of people&#x27;s work and rest patterns
in the evening/midnight of the previous day to the next-day morning traffic.
The model is tested on freeway networks in Pittsburgh as experiments. The
resulting relationship is surprisingly simple and powerful. We find that, in
general, the earlier people rest as indicated from Tweets, the more congested
roads will be in the next morning. The occurrence of big events in the evening
before, represented by higher or lower tweet sentiment than normal, often
implies lower travel demand in the next morning than normal days. Besides,
people&#x27;s tweeting activities in the night before and early morning are
statistically associated with congestion in morning peak hours. We make use of
such relationships to build a predictive framework which forecasts morning
commute congestion using people&#x27;s tweeting profiles extracted by 5 am or as
late as the midnight prior to the morning. The Pittsburgh study supports that
our framework can precisely predict morning congestion, particularly for some
road segments upstream of roadway bottlenecks with large day-to-day congestion
variation. Our approach considerably outperforms those existing methods without
Twitter message features, and it can learn meaningful representation of demand
from tweeting profiles that offer managerial insights.</span>

                    <span>In this paper we introduce a new problem within the growing literature of
interpretability for convolution neural networks (CNNs). While previous work
has focused on the question of how to visually interpret CNNs, we ask what it
is that we care to interpret, that is, which layers and neurons are worth our
attention? Due to the vast size of modern deep learning network architectures,
automated, quantitative methods are needed to rank the relative importance of
neurons so as to provide an answer to this question. We present a new
statistical method for ranking the hidden neurons in any convolutional layer of
a network. We define importance as the maximal correlation between the
activation maps and the class score. We provide different ways in which this
method can be used for visualization purposes with MNIST and ImageNet, and show
a real-world application of our method to air pollution prediction with
street-level images.</span>

                    <span>Globally, there is a substantial unmet need to diagnose various diseases
effectively. The complexity of the different disease mechanisms and underlying
symptoms of the patient population presents massive challenges to developing
the early diagnosis tool and effective treatment. Machine Learning (ML), an
area of Artificial Intelligence (AI), enables researchers, physicians, and
patients to solve some of these issues. Based on relevant research, this review
explains how Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) are being used to
help in the early identification of numerous diseases. To begin, a bibliometric
study of the publication is given using data from the Scopus and Web of Science
(WOS) databases. The bibliometric study of 1216 publications was undertaken to
determine the most prolific authors, nations, organizations, and most cited
articles. The review then summarizes the most recent trends and approaches in
Machine Learning-based Disease Diagnosis (MLBDD), considering the following
factors: algorithm, disease types, data type, application, and evaluation
metrics. Finally, the paper highlights key results and provides insight into
future trends and opportunities in the MLBDD area.</span>

                    <span>We introduce BERTphone, a Transformer encoder trained on large speech corpora
that outputs phonetically-aware contextual representation vectors that can be
used for both speaker and language recognition. This is accomplished by
training on two objectives: the first, inspired by adapting BERT to the
continuous domain, involves masking spans of input frames and reconstructing
the whole sequence for acoustic representation learning; the second, inspired
by the success of bottleneck features from ASR, is a sequence-level CTC loss
applied to phoneme labels for phonetic representation learning. We pretrain two
BERTphone models (one on Fisher and one on TED-LIUM) and use them as feature
extractors into x-vector-style DNNs for both tasks. We attain a
state-of-the-art $C_{\text{avg}}$ of 6.16 on the challenging LRE07 3sec
closed-set language recognition task. On Fisher and VoxCeleb speaker
recognition tasks, we see an 18% relative reduction in speaker EER when
training on BERTphone vectors instead of MFCCs. In general, BERTphone
outperforms previous phonetic pretraining approaches on the same data. We

                    <span>Tree-based algorithms such as random forests and gradient boosted trees
continue to be among the most popular and powerful machine learning models used
across multiple disciplines. The conventional wisdom of estimating the impact
of a feature in tree based models is to measure the \textit{node-wise reduction
of a loss function}, which (i) yields only global importance measures and (ii)
is known to suffer from severe biases. Conditional feature contributions (CFCs)
provide \textit{local}, case-by-case explanations of a prediction by following
the decision path and attributing changes in the expected output of the model
to each feature along the path. However, Lundberg et al. pointed out a
potential bias of CFCs which depends on the distance from the root of a tree.
The by now immensely popular alternative, SHapley Additive exPlanation (SHAP)
values appear to mitigate this bias but are computationally much more
expensive. Here we contribute a thorough comparison of the explanations
computed by both methods on a set of 164 publicly available classification
problems in order to provide data-driven algorithm recommendations to current
researchers. For random forests, we find extremely high similarities and
correlations of both local and global SHAP values and CFC scores, leading to
very similar rankings and interpretations. Analogous conclusions hold for the
fidelity of using global feature importance scores as a proxy for the
predictive power associated with each feature.</span>

                    <span>Alternating gradient-descent-ascent (AltGDA) is an optimization algorithm
that has been widely used for model training in various machine learning
applications, which aim to solve a nonconvex minimax optimization problem.
However, the existing studies show that it suffers from a high computation
complexity in nonconvex minimax optimization. In this paper, we develop a
single-loop and fast AltGDA-type algorithm that leverages proximal gradient
updates and momentum acceleration to solve regularized nonconvex minimax
optimization problems. By identifying the intrinsic Lyapunov function of this
algorithm, we prove that it converges to a critical point of the nonconvex
minimax optimization problem and achieves a computation complexity
$\mathcal{O}(\kappa^{1.5}\epsilon^{-2})$, where $\epsilon$ is the desired level
of accuracy and $\kappa$ is the problem&#x27;s condition number. Such a computation
complexity improves the state-of-the-art complexities of single-loop GDA and
AltGDA algorithms (see the summary of comparison in Table 1). We demonstrate
the effectiveness of our algorithm via an experiment on adversarial deep
learning.</span>

                    <span>Learning continually and online from a continuous stream of data is
challenging, especially for a reinforcement learning agent with sequential
data. When the environment only provides observations giving partial
information about the state of the environment, the agent must learn the agent
state based on the data stream of experience. We refer to the state learned
directly from the data stream of experience as the agent state. Recurrent
neural networks can learn the agent state, but the training methods are
computationally expensive and sensitive to the hyper-parameters, making them
unideal for online learning. This work introduces methods based on the
generate-and-test approach to learn the agent state. A generate-and-test
algorithm searches for state features by generating features and testing their
usefulness. In this process, features useful for the agent&#x27;s performance on the
task are preserved, and the least useful features get replaced with newly
generated features. We study the effectiveness of our methods on two online
multi-step prediction problems. The first problem, trace conditioning, focuses
on the agent&#x27;s ability to remember a cue for a prediction multiple steps into
the future. In the second problem, trace patterning, the agent needs to learn
patterns in the observation signals and remember them for future predictions.
We show that our proposed methods can effectively learn the agent state online
and produce accurate predictions.</span>

                    <span>Improvements in computational and experimental capabilities are rapidly
increasing the amount of scientific data that is routinely generated. In
applications that are constrained by memory and computational intensity,
excessively large datasets may hinder scientific discovery, making data
reduction a critical component of data-driven methods. Datasets are growing in
two directions: the number of data points and their dimensionality. Whereas
data compression techniques are concerned with reducing dimensionality, the
focus here is on reducing the number of data points. A strategy is proposed to
select data points such that they uniformly span the phase-space of the data.
The algorithm proposed relies on estimating the probability map of the data and
using it to construct an acceptance probability. An iterative method is used to
accurately estimate the probability of the rare data points when only a small
subset of the dataset is used to construct the probability map. Instead of
binning the phase-space to estimate the probability map, its functional form is
approximated with a normalizing flow. Therefore, the method naturally extends
to high-dimensional datasets. The proposed framework is demonstrated as a
viable pathway to enable data-efficient machine learning when abundant data is
available. An implementation of the method is available in a companion
repository (https://github.com/NREL/Phase-space-sampling).</span>

                    <span>Triangular flows, also known as Kn\&quot;{o}the-Rosenblatt measure couplings,
comprise an important building block of normalizing flow models for generative
modeling and density estimation, including popular autoregressive flow models
such as real-valued non-volume preserving transformation models (Real NVP). We
present statistical guarantees and sample complexity bounds for triangular flow
statistical models. In particular, we establish the statistical consistency and
the finite sample convergence rates of the Kullback-Leibler estimator of the
Kn\&quot;{o}the-Rosenblatt measure coupling using tools from empirical process
theory. Our results highlight the anisotropic geometry of function classes at
play in triangular flows, shed light on optimal coordinate ordering, and lead
to statistical guarantees for Jacobian flows. We conduct numerical experiments

findings.</span>

strategies which are robust to domain shifts. Several experiments yield a
couple of critical observations which we believe are of general interest for
any future work on WILDS. Our study focuses on two datasets: iWildCam and FMoW.
We show that (1) Conducting separate cross-validation for each evaluation
metric is crucial for both datasets, (2) A weak correlation between validation
and test performance might make model development difficult for iWildCam, (3)
Minor changes in the training of hyper-parameters improve the baseline by a
relatively large margin (mainly on FMoW), (4) There is a strong correlation
between certain domains and certain target labels (mainly on iWildCam). To the
best of our knowledge, no prior work on these datasets has reported these
observations despite their obvious importance. Our code is public.</span>

                    <span>Kidney DCE-MRI aims at both qualitative assessment of kidney anatomy and
quantitative assessment of kidney function by estimating the tracer kinetic
(TK) model parameters. Accurate estimation of TK model parameters requires an
accurate measurement of the arterial input function (AIF) with high temporal
resolution. Accelerated imaging is used to achieve high temporal resolution,
which yields under-sampling artifacts in the reconstructed images. Compressed
sensing (CS) methods offer a variety of reconstruction options. Most commonly,
sparsity of temporal differences is encouraged for regularization to reduce
artifacts. Increasing regularization in CS methods removes the ambient
artifacts but also over-smooths the signal temporally which reduces the
parameter estimation accuracy. In this work, we propose a single image trained
deep neural network to reduce MRI under-sampling artifacts without reducing the
accuracy of functional imaging markers. Instead of regularizing with a penalty
term in optimization, we promote regularization by generating images from a
lower dimensional representation. In this manuscript we motivate and explain
the lower dimensional input design. We compare our approach to CS
reconstructions with multiple regularization weights. Proposed approach results
in kidney biomarkers that are highly correlated with the ground truth markers
estimated using the CS reconstruction which was optimized for functional
analysis. At the same time, the proposed approach reduces the artifacts in the
reconstructed images.</span>

contribution is substantially more efficient than k-means as it does not
require an all to all comparison of data points and clusters. We show that the
optimal solutions of our approximation are the same as in the exact solution.
However, our approach is considerably more efficient at extracting these
clusters compared to the state-of-the-art. We compare our approximation with
the exact k-means and alternative approximation approaches on a series of
standardised clustering tasks. For the evaluation, we consider the algorithmic
complexity, including number of operations to convergence, and the stability of

                    <span>We propose a novel and effective purification based adversarial defense
method against pre-processor blind white- and black-box attacks. Our method is
computationally efficient and trained only with self-supervised learning on
general images, without requiring any adversarial training or retraining of the
classification model. We first show an empirical analysis on the adversarial
noise, defined to be the residual between an original image and its adversarial
example, has almost zero mean, symmetric distribution. Based on this
observation, we propose a very simple iterative Gaussian Smoothing (GS) which
can effectively smooth out adversarial noise and achieve substantially high
robust accuracy. To further improve it, we propose Neural Contextual Iterative
Smoothing (NCIS), which trains a blind-spot network (BSN) in a self-supervised
manner to reconstruct the discriminative features of the original image that is
also smoothed out by GS. From our extensive experiments on the large-scale
ImageNet using four classification models, we show that our method achieves
both competitive standard accuracy and state-of-the-art robust accuracy against
most strong purifier-blind white- and black-box attacks. Also, we propose a new
benchmark for evaluating a purification method based on commercial image
classification APIs, such as AWS, Azure, Clarifai and Google. We generate
adversarial examples by ensemble transfer-based black-box attack, which can
induce complete misclassification of APIs, and demonstrate that our method can
be used to increase adversarial robustness of APIs.</span>

of partially ordered data that preserves the partial order. That is, if $x \le
y$, and if $[x]$ and $[y]$ are the respective clusters of $x$ and $y$, then
there is an order relation $\le&#x27;$ on the clusters for which $[x] \le&#x27; |y]$. The
theory distinguishes itself from existing theories for clustering of ordered
data in that the order relation and the similarity are combined into a
bi-objective optimisation problem to obtain a hierarchical clustering seeking
to satisfy both. In particular, the order relation is weighted in the range
$[0,1]$, and if the similarity and the order relation are not aligned, then
order preservation may have to yield in favor of clustering. Finding an optimal
solution is NP-hard, so we provide a polynomial time approximation algorithm,
with a relative performance guarantee of $O\!\left(\log^{3/2} \!\!\, n
\right)$, based on successive applications of directed sparsest cut. We provide
a demonstration on a benchmark dataset, showing that our method outperforms
existing methods for order preserving hierarchical clustering with significant

hierarchical clustering.</span>

                    <span>A recent line of research on deep learning focuses on the extremely
over-parameterized setting, and shows that when the network width is larger
than a high degree polynomial of the training sample size $n$ and the inverse
of the target error $\epsilon^{-1}$, deep neural networks learned by
(stochastic) gradient descent enjoy nice optimization and generalization
guarantees. Very recently, it is shown that under certain margin assumptions on
the training data, a polylogarithmic width condition suffices for two-layer
ReLU networks to converge and generalize (Ji and Telgarsky, 2019). However,
whether deep neural networks can be learned with such a mild
over-parameterization is still an open question. In this work, we answer this
question affirmatively and establish sharper learning guarantees for deep ReLU
networks trained by (stochastic) gradient descent. In specific, under certain
assumptions made in previous work, our optimization and generalization
guarantees hold with network width polylogarithmic in $n$ and $\epsilon^{-1}$.
Our results push the study of over-parameterized deep neural networks towards
more practical settings.</span>

                    <span>Hierarchical forecasting with intermittent time series is a challenge in both
research and empirical studies. Extensive research focuses on improving the
accuracy of each hierarchy, especially the intermittent time series at bottom
levels. Then hierarchical reconciliation could be used to improve the overall
performance further. In this paper, we present a
\emph{hierarchical-forecasting-with-alignment} approach that treats the bottom
level forecasts as mutable to ensure higher forecasting accuracy on the upper
levels of the hierarchy. We employ a pure deep learning forecasting approach
N-BEATS for continuous time series at the top levels and a widely used
tree-based algorithm LightGBM for the intermittent time series at the bottom
level. The \emph{hierarchical-forecasting-with-alignment} approach is a simple
yet effective variant of the bottom-up method, accounting for biases that are
difficult to observe at the bottom level. It allows suboptimal forecasts at the
lower level to retain a higher overall performance. The approach in this
empirical study was developed by the first author during the M5 Forecasting
Accuracy competition, ranking second place. The method is also business
orientated and could benefit for business strategic planning.</span>

                    <span>This paper analyzes a two-timescale stochastic algorithm framework for
bilevel optimization. Bilevel optimization is a class of problems which exhibit
a two-level structure, and its goal is to minimize an outer objective function
with variables which are constrained to be the optimal solution to an (inner)
optimization problem. We consider the case when the inner problem is
unconstrained and strongly convex, while the outer problem is constrained and
has a smooth objective function. We propose a two-timescale stochastic
approximation (TTSA) algorithm for tackling such a bilevel problem. In the
algorithm, a stochastic gradient update with a larger step size is used for the
inner problem, while a projected stochastic gradient update with a smaller step
size is used for the outer problem. We analyze the convergence rates for the
TTSA algorithm under various settings: when the outer problem is strongly
convex (resp.~weakly convex), the TTSA algorithm finds an
$\mathcal{O}(K^{-2/3})$-optimal (resp.~$\mathcal{O}(K^{-2/5})$-stationary)
solution, where $K$ is the total iteration number. As an application, we show
that a two-timescale natural actor-critic proximal policy optimization
algorithm can be viewed as a special case of our TTSA framework. Importantly,
the natural actor-critic algorithm is shown to converge at a rate of
$\mathcal{O}(K^{-1/4})$ in terms of the gap in expected discounted reward
compared to a global optimal policy.</span>

                    <span>Adversarial training is so far the most effective strategy in defending
against adversarial examples. However, it suffers from high computational costs
due to the iterative adversarial attacks in each training step. Recent studies
show that it is possible to achieve fast Adversarial Training by performing a
single-step attack with random initialization. However, such an approach still
lags behind state-of-the-art adversarial training algorithms on both stability
and model robustness. In this work, we develop a new understanding towards Fast
Adversarial Training, by viewing random initialization as performing randomized
smoothing for better optimization of the inner maximization problem. Following
this new perspective, we also propose a new initialization strategy, backward
smoothing, to further improve the stability and model robustness over
single-step robust training methods. Experiments on multiple benchmarks
demonstrate that our method achieves similar model robustness as the original
TRADES method while using much less training time ($\sim$3x improvement with
the same training schedule).</span>

                    <span>Pre-trained language models have been successful on text classification
tasks, but are prone to learning spurious correlations from biased datasets,
and are thus vulnerable when making inferences in a new domain. Prior work
reveals such spurious patterns via post-hoc explanation algorithms which
compute the importance of input features. Further, the model is regularized to
align the importance scores with human knowledge, so that the unintended model
behaviors are eliminated. However, such a regularization technique lacks
flexibility and coverage, since only importance scores towards a pre-defined
list of features are adjusted, while more complex human knowledge such as
feature interaction and pattern generalization can hardly be incorporated. In
this work, we propose to refine a learned language model for a target domain by
collecting human-provided compositional explanations regarding observed biases.
By parsing these explanations into executable logic rules, the human-specified
refinement advice from a small set of explanations can be generalized to more
training examples. We additionally introduce a regularization term allowing
adjustments for both importance and interaction of features to better rectify
model behavior. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach on
two text classification tasks by showing improved performance in target domain
as well as improved model fairness after refinement.</span>

                    <span>Deep neural networks (DNNs) are powerful tools for compressing and distilling
information. Due to their scale and complexity, often involving billions of
inter-dependent internal degrees of freedom, exact analysis approaches often
fall short. A common strategy in such cases is to identify slow degrees of
freedom that average out the erratic behavior of the underlying fast
microscopic variables. Here, we identify such a separation of scales occurring
in over-parameterized deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) at the end of
training. It implies that neuron pre-activations fluctuate in a nearly Gaussian
manner with a deterministic latent kernel. While for CNNs with infinitely many
channels these kernels are inert, for finite CNNs they adapt and learn from
data in an analytically tractable manner. The resulting thermodynamic theory of
deep learning yields accurate predictions on several deep non-linear CNN toy
models. In addition, it provides new ways of analyzing and understanding CNNs.</span>

domain discriminative feature module to encourage the domain invariant feature
module to learn more domain invariant features. The proposed architecture can
be applied to any model that utilizes domain invariant features for
unsupervised domain adaptation to improve its ability to extract domain
invariant features. We conduct experiments with the Domain-Adversarial Training
of Neural Networks (DANN) model as a representative algorithm. In the training
process, we supply the same input to the two modules and then extract their
feature distribution and prediction results respectively. We propose a
discrepancy loss to find the discrepancy of the prediction results and the
feature distribution between the two modules. Through the adversarial training
by maximizing the loss of their feature distribution and minimizing the
discrepancy of their prediction results, the two modules are encouraged to
learn more domain discriminative and domain invariant features respectively.
Extensive comparative evaluations are conducted and the proposed approach
outperforms the state-of-the-art in most unsupervised domain adaptation tasks.</span>

of their underlying mechanisms continues to be an obstacle in adoption. To
instill confidence and trust in artificial intelligence systems, Explainable
Artificial Intelligence has emerged as a response to improving modern machine
learning algorithms&#x27; explainability. Inductive Logic Programming (ILP), a
subfield of symbolic artificial intelligence, plays a promising role in
generating interpretable explanations because of its intuitive logic-driven
framework. ILP effectively leverages abductive reasoning to generate
explainable first-order clausal theories from examples and background
knowledge. However, several challenges in developing methods inspired by ILP
need to be addressed for their successful application in practice. For example,
existing ILP systems often have a vast solution space, and the induced
solutions are very sensitive to noises and disturbances. This survey paper
summarizes the recent advances in ILP and a discussion of statistical
relational learning and neural-symbolic algorithms, which offer synergistic
views to ILP. Following a critical review of the recent advances, we delineate
observed challenges and highlight potential avenues of further ILP-motivated
research toward developing self-explanatory artificial intelligence systems.</span>

                    <span>Before researchers rush to reason across all available data or try complex
methods, perhaps it is prudent to first check for simpler alternatives.
Specifically, if the historical data has the most information in some small
region, then perhaps a model learned from that region would suffice for the
rest of the project.

To support this claim, we offer a case study with 240 GitHub projects, where
we find that the information in those projects &quot;clumped&quot; towards the earliest
parts of the project. A defect prediction model learned from just the first 150
commits works as well, or better than state-of-the-art alternatives. Using just
this early life cycle data, we can build models very quickly, very early in the
software project life cycle. Moreover, using this method, we have shown that a
simple model (with just two features) generalizes to hundreds of software
projects.

Based on this experience, we doubt that prior work on generalizing software
engineering defect prediction models may have needlessly complicated an
inherently simple process. Further, prior work that focused on later-life cycle
data needs to be revisited since their conclusions were drawn from relatively
uninformative regions.

                    <span>Extrapolating beyond-demonstrator (BD) performance through the imitation
learning (IL) algorithm aims to learn from and outperform the demonstrator.
Most existing BDIL algorithms are performed in two stages by first inferring a
reward function before learning a policy via reinforcement learning (RL).
However, such two-stage BDIL algorithms suffer from high computational
complexity, weak robustness, and large performance variations. In particular, a
poor reward function derived in the first stage will inevitably incur severe
performance loss in the second stage. In this work, we propose a hybrid
adversarial imitation learning (HAIL) algorithm that is one-stage, model-free,
generative-adversarial (GA) fashion and curiosity-driven. Thanks to the
one-stage design, the HAIL can integrate both the reward function learning and
the policy optimization into one procedure, which leads to many advantages such
as low computational complexity, high robustness, and strong adaptability. More
specifically, HAIL simultaneously imitates the demonstrator and explores BD
performance by utilizing hybrid rewards. Extensive simulation results confirm
that HAIL can achieve higher performance as compared to other similar BDIL
algorithms.</span>

                    <span>Multinomial Logit (MNL) is one of the most popular discrete choice models and
has been widely used to model ranking data. However, there is a long-standing
technical challenge of learning MNL from many real-world ranking data: exact
calculation of the MNL likelihood of \emph{partial rankings} is generally
intractable. In this work, we develop a scalable method for approximating the
MNL likelihood of general partial rankings in polynomial time complexity. We
also extend the proposed method to learn mixture of MNL. We demonstrate that
the proposed methods are particularly helpful for applications to choice-based
network formation modeling, where the formation of new edges in a network is
viewed as individuals making choices of their friends over a candidate set. The
problem of learning mixture of MNL models from partial rankings naturally
arises in such applications. And the proposed methods can be used to learn MNL
models from network data without the strong assumption that temporal orders of
all the edge formation are available. We conduct experiments on both synthetic
and real-world network data to demonstrate that the proposed methods achieve
more accurate parameter estimation and better fitness of data compared to
conventional methods.</span>

and the theoretical convergence and generalization bounds for DFL. As such, our
proposed overlay networks accelerate convergence, improve generalization, and
enhance robustness to clients failures in DFL with theoretical guarantees.
Also, we present an efficient algorithm to convert a given graph to a practical

new toolkit is mainly based on vaulted Transformer (Vaswani et al., 2017) along
with many other improvements detailed below, in order to create a
self-contained, simple to use, consistent and comprehensive framework for
Machine Translation tasks of various domains. It is tooled to support both

                    <span>A time series represents a set of observations collected over time.
Typically, these observations are captured with a uniform sampling frequency
(e.g. daily). When data points are observed in uneven time intervals the time
series is referred to as irregular or intermittent. In such scenarios, the most
common solution is to reconstruct the time series to make it regular, thus
removing its intermittency. We hypothesise that, in irregular time series, the
time at which each observation is collected may be helpful to summarise the
dynamics of the data and improve forecasting performance. We study this idea by
developing a novel automatic feature engineering framework, which focuses on
extracting information from this point of view, i.e., when each instance is
collected. We study how valuable this information is by integrating it in a
time series forecasting workflow and investigate how it compares to or
complements state-of-the-art methods for regular time series forecasting. In
the end, we contribute by providing a novel framework that tackles feature
engineering for time series from an angle previously vastly ignored. We show
that our approach has the potential to further extract more information about
time series that significantly improves forecasting performance.</span>

                    <span>Predicting human motion from historical pose sequence is crucial for a
machine to succeed in intelligent interactions with humans. One aspect that has
been obviated so far, is the fact that how we represent the skeletal pose has a
critical impact on the prediction results. Yet there is no effort that
investigates across different pose representation schemes. We conduct an
indepth study on various pose representations with a focus on their effects on
the motion prediction task. Moreover, recent approaches build upon
off-the-shelf RNN units for motion prediction. These approaches process input
pose sequence sequentially and inherently have difficulties in capturing
long-term dependencies. In this paper, we propose a novel RNN architecture
termed AHMR (Attentive Hierarchical Motion Recurrent network) for motion
prediction which simultaneously models local motion contexts and a global
context. We further explore a geodesic loss and a forward kinematics loss for
the motion prediction task, which have more geometric significance than the
widely employed L2 loss. Interestingly, we applied our method to a range of
articulate objects including human, fish, and mouse. Empirical results show
that our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in short-term
prediction and achieves much enhanced long-term prediction proficiency, such as
retaining natural human-like motions over 50 seconds predictions. Our codes are
released.</span>

                    <span>To approach different business objectives, online traffic shaping algorithms
aim at improving exposures of a target set of items, such as boosting the
growth of new commodities. Generally, these algorithms assume that the utility
of each user-item pair can be accessed via a well-trained conversion rate
prediction model. However, for real E-Commerce platforms, there are unavoidable
factors preventing us from learning such an accurate model. In order to break
the heavy dependence on accurate inputs of the utility, we propose a general
online traffic shaping protocol for online E-Commerce applications. In our
framework, we approximate the function mapping the bonus scores, which
generally are the only method to influence the ranking result in the traffic
shaping problem, to the numbers of exposures and purchases. Concretely, we
approximate the above function by a class of the piece-wise linear function
constructed on the convex hull of the explored data points. Moreover, we
reformulate the online traffic shaping problem as linear programming where
these piece-wise linear functions are embedded into both the objective and
constraints. Our algorithm can straightforwardly optimize the linear
programming in the prime space, and its solution can be simply applied by a
stochastic strategy to fulfill the optimized objective and the constraints in
expectation. Finally, the online A/B test shows our proposed algorithm steadily
outperforms the previous industrial level traffic shaping algorithm.</span>

                    <span>Objective: The paper focuses on development of robust and accurate processing
solutions for continuous and cuff-less blood pressure (BP) monitoring. In this
regard, a robust deep learning-based framework is proposed for computation of
low latency, continuous, and calibration-free upper and lower bounds on the
systolic and diastolic BP. Method: Referred to as the BP-Net, the proposed
framework is a novel convolutional architecture that provides longer effective
memory while achieving superior performance due to incorporation of casual
dialated convolutions and residual connections. To utilize the real potential
of deep learning in extraction of intrinsic features (deep features) and
enhance the long-term robustness, the BP-Net uses raw Electrocardiograph (ECG)
and Photoplethysmograph (PPG) signals without extraction of any form of
hand-crafted features as it is common in existing solutions. Results: By
capitalizing on the fact that datasets used in recent literature are not
unified and properly defined, a benchmark dataset is constructed from the
MIMIC-I and MIMIC-III databases obtained from PhysioNet. The proposed BP-Net is
evaluated based on this benchmark dataset demonstrating promising performance
and shows superior generalizable capacity. Conclusion: The proposed BP-Net
architecture is more accurate than canonical recurrent networks and enhances
the long-term robustness of the BP estimation task. Significance: The proposed
BP-Net architecture addresses key drawbacks of existing BP estimation
solutions, i.e., relying heavily on extraction of hand-crafted features, such
as pulse arrival time (PAT), and; Lack of robustness. Finally, the constructed
BP-Net dataset provides a unified base for evaluation and comparison of deep
learning-based BP estimation algorithms.</span>

                    <span>Recently, hyperspectral imaging (HSI) has attracted increasing research
attention, especially for the ones based on a coded aperture snapshot spectral
imaging (CASSI) system. Existing deep HSI reconstruction models are generally
trained on paired data to retrieve original signals upon 2D compressed
measurements given by a particular optical hardware mask in CASSI, during which
the mask largely impacts the reconstruction performance and could work as a
&quot;model hyperparameter&quot; governing on data augmentations. This mask-specific
training style will lead to a hardware miscalibration issue, which sets up
barriers to deploying deep HSI models among different hardware and noisy
environments. To address this challenge, we introduce mask uncertainty for HSI
with a complete variational Bayesian learning treatment and explicitly model it
through a mask decomposition inspired by real hardware. Specifically, we
propose a novel Graph-based Self-Tuning (GST) network to reason uncertainties
adapting to varying spatial structures of masks among different hardware.
Moreover, we develop a bilevel optimization framework to balance HSI
reconstruction and uncertainty estimation, accounting for the hyperparameter
property of masks. Extensive experimental results and model discussions
validate the effectiveness (over 33/30 dB) of the proposed GST method under two
miscalibration scenarios and demonstrate a highly competitive performance
compared with the state-of-the-art well-calibrated methods. Our code and
pre-trained model are available at https://github.com/Jiamian

                    <span>Distributed Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) algorithms has
attracted a surge of interest lately mainly due to the recent advancements of
Deep Neural Networks (DNNs). Conventional Model-Based (MB) or Model-Free (MF)
RL algorithms are not directly applicable to the MARL problems due to
utilization of a fixed reward model for learning the underlying value function.
While DNN-based solutions perform utterly well when a single agent is involved,
such methods fail to fully generalize to the complexities of MARL problems. In
other words, although recently developed approaches based on DNNs for
multi-agent environments have achieved superior performance, they are still
prone to overfiting, high sensitivity to parameter selection, and sample
inefficiency. The paper proposes the Multi-Agent Adaptive Kalman Temporal
Difference (MAK-TD) framework and its Successor Representation-based variant,
referred to as the MAK-SR. Intuitively speaking, the main objective is to
capitalize on unique characteristics of Kalman Filtering (KF) such as
uncertainty modeling and online second order learning. The proposed MAK-TD/SR
frameworks consider the continuous nature of the action-space that is
associated with high dimensional multi-agent environments and exploit Kalman
Temporal Difference (KTD) to address the parameter uncertainty. By leveraging
the KTD framework, SR learning procedure is modeled into a filtering problem,
where Radial Basis Function (RBF) estimators are used to encode the continuous
space into feature vectors. On the other hand, for learning localized reward
functions, we resort to Multiple Model Adaptive Estimation (MMAE), to deal with
the lack of prior knowledge on the observation noise covariance and observation
mapping function. The proposed MAK-TD/SR frameworks are evaluated via several
experiments, which are implemented through the OpenAI Gym MARL benchmarks.</span>

                    <span>In dynamic programming (DP) and reinforcement learning (RL), an agent learns
to act optimally in terms of expected long-term return by sequentially
interacting with its environment modeled by a Markov decision process (MDP).
More generally in distributional reinforcement learning (DRL), the focus is on
the whole distribution of the return, not just its expectation. Although
DRL-based methods produced state-of-the-art performance in RL with function
approximation, they involve additional quantities (compared to the
non-distributional setting) that are still not well understood. As a first
contribution, we introduce a new class of distributional operators, together
with a practical DP algorithm for policy evaluation, that come with a robust
MDP interpretation. Indeed, our approach reformulates through an augmented
state space where each state is split into a worst-case substate and a
best-case substate, whose values are maximized by safe and risky policies
respectively. Finally, we derive distributional operators and DP algorithms
solving a new control task: How to distinguish safe from risky optimal actions
in order to break ties in the space of optimal policies?</span>

agents, each possessing a local cost function, collaboratively minimize the
average of the local cost functions over a connected network. To solve the
problem, we propose a distributed random reshuffling (D-RR) algorithm that
combines the classical distributed gradient descent (DGD) method and Random
Reshuffling (RR). We show that D-RR inherits the superiority of RR for both
smooth strongly convex and smooth nonconvex objective functions. In particular,
for smooth strongly convex objective functions, D-RR achieves
$\mathcal{O}(1/T^2)$ rate of convergence (here, $T$ counts the total number of
iterations) in terms of the squared distance between the iterate and the unique
minimizer. When the objective function is assumed to be smooth nonconvex and
has Lipschitz continuous component functions, we show that D-RR drives the
squared norm of gradient to $0$ at a rate of $\mathcal{O}(1/T^{2/3})$. These
convergence results match those of centralized RR (up to constant factors).</span>

                    <span>Web-based interactions can be frequently represented by an attributed graph,
and node clustering in such graphs has received much attention lately. Multiple
efforts have successfully applied Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN), though
with some limits on accuracy as GCNs have been shown to suffer from
over-smoothing issues. Though other methods (particularly those based on
Laplacian Smoothing) have reported better accuracy, a fundamental limitation of
all the work is a lack of scalability. This paper addresses this open problem
by relating the Laplacian smoothing to the Generalized PageRank and applying a
random-walk based algorithm as a scalable graph filter. This forms the basis
for our scalable deep clustering algorithm, RwSL, where through a
self-supervised mini-batch training mechanism, we simultaneously optimize a
deep neural network for sample-cluster assignment distribution and an
autoencoder for a clustering-oriented embedding. Using 6 real-world datasets
and 6 clustering metrics, we show that RwSL achieved improved results over
several recent baselines. Most notably, we show that RwSL, unlike all other
deep clustering frameworks, can continue to scale beyond graphs with more than
one million nodes, i.e., handle web-scale. We also demonstrate how RwSL could
perform node clustering on a graph with 1.8 billion edges using only a single
GPU.</span>

                    <span>Hyperdimensional Computing (HDC), also known as Vector-Symbolic Architectures
(VSA), is a promising framework for the development of cognitive architectures
and artificial intelligence systems, as well as for technical applications and
emerging neuromorphic and nanoscale hardware. HDC/VSA operate with
hypervectors, i.e., distributed vector representations of large fixed dimension
(usually &gt; 1000). One of the key ingredients of HDC/VSA are the methods for
encoding data of various types (from numeric scalars and vectors to graphs)
into hypervectors. In this paper, we propose an approach for the formation of
hypervectors of sequences that provides both an equivariance with respect to
the shift of sequences and preserves the similarity of sequences with identical
elements at nearby positions. Our methods represent the sequence elements by
compositional hypervectors and exploit permutations of hypervectors for
representing the order of sequence elements. We experimentally explored the
proposed representations using a diverse set of tasks with data in the form of
symbolic strings. Although our approach is feature-free as it forms the
hypervector of a sequence from the hypervectors of its symbols at their
positions, it demonstrated the performance on a par with the methods that apply
various features, such as subsequences. The proposed techniques were designed
for the HDC/VSA model known as Sparse Binary Distributed Representations.
However, they can be adapted to hypervectors in formats of other HDC/VSA
models, as well as for representing sequences of types other than symbolic
strings.</span>

                    <span>Human mobility data accumulated from Point-of-Interest (POI) check-ins
provides great opportunity for user behavior understanding. However, data
quality issues (e.g., geolocation information missing, unreal check-ins, data
sparsity) in real-life mobility data limit the effectiveness of existing
POI-oriented studies, e.g., POI recommendation and location prediction, when
applied to real applications. To this end, in this paper, we develop a model,
named Bi-STDDP, which can integrate bi-directional spatio-temporal dependence
and users&#x27; dynamic preferences, to identify the missing POI check-in where a
user has visited at a specific time. Specifically, we first utilize
bi-directional global spatial and local temporal information of POIs to capture
the complex dependence relationships. Then, target temporal pattern in
combination with user and POI information are fed into a multi-layer network to
capture users&#x27; dynamic preferences. Moreover, the dynamic preferences are
transformed into the same space as the dependence relationships to form the
final model. Finally, the proposed model is evaluated on three large-scale
real-world datasets and the results demonstrate significant improvements of our
model compared with state-of-the-art methods. Also, it is worth noting that the
proposed model can be naturally extended to address POI recommendation and
location prediction tasks with competitive performances.</span>

perceived by the children could contribute to such early intervention of
autism. In this regard, the paper implements in identifying basic facial
expression and exploring their emotions upon a time variant factor. The
emotions are analyzed by incorporating the facial expression identified through
CNN using 68 landmark points plotted on the frontal face with a prediction
network formed by RNN known as RCNN-FER system. The paper adopts R-CNN to take
the advantage of increased accuracy and performance with decreased time
complexity in predicting emotion as a textual network analysis. The papers
proves better accuracy in identifying the emotion in autistic children when
compared over simple machine learning models built for such identifications
contributing to autistic society.</span>

                    <span>Direct policy search serves as one of the workhorses in modern reinforcement
learning (RL), and its applications in continuous control tasks have recently
attracted increasing attention. In this work, we investigate the convergence
theory of policy gradient (PG) methods for learning the linear risk-sensitive
and robust controller. In particular, we develop PG methods that can be
implemented in a derivative-free fashion by sampling system trajectories, and
establish both global convergence and sample complexity results in the
solutions of two fundamental settings in risk-sensitive and robust control: the
finite-horizon linear exponential quadratic Gaussian, and the finite-horizon
linear-quadratic disturbance attenuation problems. As a by-product, our results
also provide the first sample complexity for the global convergence of PG
methods on solving zero-sum linear-quadratic dynamic games, a
nonconvex-nonconcave minimax optimization problem that serves as a baseline
setting in multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) with continuous spaces.
One feature of our algorithms is that during the learning phase, a certain
level of robustness/risk-sensitivity of the controller is preserved, which we
termed as the implicit regularization property, and is an essential requirement
in safety-critical control systems.</span>

                    <span>The analysis of long sequence data remains challenging in many real-world
applications. We propose a novel architecture, ChunkFormer, that improves the
existing Transformer framework to handle the challenges while dealing with long
time series. Original Transformer-based models adopt an attention mechanism to
discover global information along a sequence to leverage the contextual data.
Long sequential data traps local information such as seasonality and
fluctuations in short data sequences. In addition, the original Transformer
consumes more resources by carrying the entire attention matrix during the
training course. To overcome these challenges, ChunkFormer splits the long
sequences into smaller sequence chunks for the attention calculation,
progressively applying different chunk sizes in each stage. In this way, the
proposed model gradually learns both local and global information without
changing the total length of the input sequences. We have extensively tested
the effectiveness of this new architecture on different business domains and
have proved the advantage of such a model over the existing Transformer-based
models.</span>

                    <span>A/B testing, or online experiment is a standard business strategy to compare
a new product with an old one in pharmaceutical, technological, and traditional
industries. Major challenges arise in online experiments of two-sided
marketplace platforms (e.g., Uber) where there is only one unit that receives a
sequence of treatments over time. In those experiments, the treatment at a
given time impacts current outcome as well as future outcomes. The aim of this
paper is to introduce a reinforcement learning framework for carrying A/B
testing in these experiments, while characterizing the long-term treatment
effects. Our proposed testing procedure allows for sequential monitoring and
online updating. It is generally applicable to a variety of treatment designs
in different industries. In addition, we systematically investigate the
theoretical properties (e.g., size and power) of our testing procedure.
Finally, we apply our framework to both simulated data and a real-world data
example obtained from a technological company to illustrate its advantage over
the current practice. A Python implementation of our test is available at

                    <span>Many payment platforms hold large-scale marketing campaigns, which allocate
incentives to encourage users to pay through their applications. To maximize
the return on investment, incentive allocations are commonly solved in a
two-stage procedure. After training a response estimation model to estimate the
users&#x27; mobile payment probabilities (MPP), a linear programming process is
applied to obtain the optimal incentive allocation. However, the large amount
of biased data in the training set, generated by the previous biased allocation
policy, causes a biased estimation. This bias deteriorates the performance of
the response model and misleads the linear programming process, dramatically
degrading the performance of the resulting allocation policy. To overcome this
obstacle, we propose a bias correction adversarial network. Our method
leverages the small set of unbiased data obtained under a full-randomized
allocation policy to train an unbiased model and then uses it to reduce the
bias with adversarial learning. Offline and online experimental results
demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches and
significantly improves the performance of the resulting allocation policy in a
real-world marketing campaign.</span>

                    <span>Information-theoretic measures have been widely adopted in the design of
features for learning and decision problems. Inspired by this, we look at the
relationship between i) a weak form of information loss in the Shannon sense
and ii) the operation loss in the minimum probability of error (MPE) sense when
considering a family of lossy continuous representations (features) of a
continuous observation. We present several results that shed light on this
interplay. Our first result offers a lower bound on a weak form of information
loss as a function of its respective operation loss when adopting a discrete
lossy representation (quantization) instead of the original raw observation.
From this, our main result shows that a specific form of vanishing information
loss (a weak notion of asymptotic informational sufficiency) implies a
vanishing MPE loss (or asymptotic operational sufficiency) when considering a
general family of lossy continuous representations. Our theoretical findings
support the observation that the selection of feature representations that
attempt to capture informational sufficiency is appropriate for learning, but
this selection is a rather conservative design principle if the intended goal
is achieving MPE in classification. Supporting this last point, and under some
structural conditions, we show that it is possible to adopt an alternative
notion of informational sufficiency (strictly weaker than pure sufficiency in
the mutual information sense) to achieve operational sufficiency in learning.</span>

                    <span>The displacement of two immiscible fluids is a common problem in fluid flow
in porous media. Such a problem can be posed as a partial differential equation
(PDE) in what is commonly referred to as a Buckley-Leverett (B-L) problem. The
B-L problem is a non-linear hyperbolic conservation law that is known to be
notoriously difficult to solve using traditional numerical methods. Here, we
address the forward hyperbolic B-L problem with a nonconvex flux function using
physics-informed neural networks (PINNs). The contributions of this paper are
twofold. First, we present a PINN approach to solve the hyperbolic B-L problem
by embedding the Oleinik entropy condition into the neural network residual. We
do not use a diffusion term (artificial viscosity) in the residual-loss, but we
rely on the strong form of the PDE. Second, we use the Adam optimizer with
residual-based adaptive refinement (RAR) algorithm to achieve an ultra-low loss
without weighting. Our solution method can accurately capture the shock-front
and produce an accurate overall solution. We report a L2 validation error of 2
x 10-2 and a L2 loss of 1x 10-6. The proposed method does not require any
additional regularization or weighting of losses to obtain such accurate
solution.</span>

                    <span>The recent success of deep learning applications has coincided with those
widely available powerful computational resources for training sophisticated
machine learning models with huge datasets. Nonetheless, training large models
such as convolutional neural networks using model parallelism (as opposed to
data parallelism) is challenging because the complex nature of communication
between model shards makes it difficult to partition the computation
efficiently across multiple machines with an acceptable trade-off. This paper
presents SplitBrain, a high performance distributed deep learning framework
supporting hybrid data and model parallelism. Specifically, SplitBrain provides
layer-specific partitioning that co-locates compute intensive convolutional
layers while sharding memory demanding layers. A novel scalable group
communication is proposed to further improve the training throughput with
reduced communication overhead. The results show that SplitBrain can achieve
nearly linear speedup while saving up to 67\% of memory consumption for data
and model parallel VGG over CIFAR-10.</span>

                    <span>Learning powerful representations is one central theme of graph neural
networks (GNNs). It requires refining the critical information from the input
graph, instead of the trivial patterns, to enrich the representations. Towards
this end, graph attention and pooling methods prevail. They mostly follow the
paradigm of &quot;learning to attend&quot;. It maximizes the mutual information between
the attended subgraph and the ground-truth label. However, this training
paradigm is prone to capture the spurious correlations between the trivial
subgraph and the label. Such spurious correlations are beneficial to
in-distribution (ID) test evaluations, but cause poor generalization in the
out-of-distribution (OOD) test data. In this work, we revisit the GNN modeling
from the causal perspective. On the top of our causal assumption, the trivial
information serves as a confounder between the critical information and the
label, which opens a backdoor path between them and makes them spuriously
correlated. Hence, we present a new paradigm of deconfounded training (DTP)
that better mitigates the confounding effect and latches on the critical
information, to enhance the representation and generalization ability.
Specifically, we adopt the attention modules to disentangle the critical
subgraph and trivial subgraph. Then we make each critical subgraph fairly
interact with diverse trivial subgraphs to achieve a stable prediction. It
allows GNNs to capture a more reliable subgraph whose relation with the label
is robust across different distributions. We conduct extensive experiments on
synthetic and real-world datasets to demonstrate the effectiveness.</span>

                    <span>Dance choreography for a piece of music is a challenging task, having to be
creative in presenting distinctive stylistic dance elements while taking into
account the musical theme and rhythm. It has been tackled by different
approaches such as similarity retrieval, sequence-to-sequence modeling and
generative adversarial networks, but their generated dance sequences are often
short of motion realism, diversity and music consistency. In this paper, we
propose a Music-to-Dance with Optimal Transport Network (MDOT-Net) for learning
to generate 3D dance choreographs from music. We introduce an optimal transport
distance for evaluating the authenticity of the generated dance distribution
and a Gromov-Wasserstein distance to measure the correspondence between the
dance distribution and the input music. This gives a well defined and
non-divergent training objective that mitigates the limitation of standard GAN
training which is frequently plagued with instability and divergent generator
loss issues. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our MDOT-Net can synthesize
realistic and diverse dances which achieve an organic unity with the input
music, reflecting the shared intentionality and matching the rhythmic
articulation.</span>

developing ML-based applications and the current industry practices. Moreover,
it is unclear where software engineering researchers should focus their efforts

application development. We synthesize the results obtained from 80

                    <span>Multi-class classification is one of the most common tasks in machine
learning applications, where data is labeled by one of many class labels. Many
loss functions have been proposed for multi-class classification including two
well-known ones, namely the cross-entropy (CE) loss and the crammer-singer (CS)
loss (aka. the SVM loss). While CS loss has been used widely for traditional
machine learning tasks, CE loss is usually a default choice for multi-class
deep learning tasks. There are also top-$k$ variants of CS loss and CE loss
that are proposed to promote the learning of a classifier for achieving better
top-$k$ accuracy. Nevertheless, it still remains unclear the relationship
between these different losses, which hinders our understanding of their
expectations in different scenarios. In this paper, we present a unified view
of the CS/CE losses and their smoothed top-$k$ variants by proposing a new
family of loss functions, which are arguably better than the CS/CE losses when
the given label information is incomplete and noisy. The new family of smooth
loss functions named {label-distributionally robust (LDR) loss} is defined by
leveraging the distributionally robust optimization (DRO) framework to model
the uncertainty in the given label information, where the uncertainty over true
class labels is captured by using distributional weights for each label
regularized by a function.</span>

                    <span>Accurate decoding of surface electromyography (sEMG) is pivotal for
muscle-to-machine-interfaces (MMI) and their application for e.g.
rehabilitation therapy. sEMG signals have high inter-subject variability, due
to various factors, including skin thickness, body fat percentage, and
electrode placement. Therefore, obtaining high generalization quality of a
trained sEMG decoder is quite challenging. Usually, machine learning based sEMG
decoders are either trained on subject-specific data, or at least recalibrated
for each user, individually. Even though, deep learning algorithms produced
several state of the art results for sEMG decoding,however, due to the limited
amount of availability of sEMG data, the deep learning models are prone to
overfitting. Recently, transfer learning for domain adaptation improved
generalization quality with reduced training time on various machine learning
tasks. In this study, we investigate the effectiveness of transfer learning
using weight initialization for recalibration of two different pretrained deep
learning models on a new subjects data, and compare their performance to
subject-specific models. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study
that thoroughly investigated weight-initialization based transfer learning for
sEMG classification and compared transfer learning to subject-specific
modeling. We tested our models on three publicly available databases under
various settings. On average over all settings, our transfer learning approach
improves 5~\%-points on the pretrained models without fine-tuning and
12~\%-points on the subject-specific models, while being trained on average
22~\% fewer epochs. Our results indicate that transfer learning enables faster
training on fewer samples than user-specific models, and improves the
performance of pretrained models as long as enough data is available.</span>

                    <span>Many prediction tasks of real-world applications need to model multi-order
feature interactions in user&#x27;s event sequence for better detection performance.
However, existing popular solutions usually suffer two key issues: 1) only
focusing on feature interactions and failing to capture the sequence influence;
2) only focusing on sequence information, but ignoring internal feature
relations of each event, thus failing to extract a better event representation.
In this paper, we consider a two-level structure for capturing the hierarchical
information over user&#x27;s event sequence: 1) learning effective feature
interactions based event representation; 2) modeling the sequence
representation of user&#x27;s historical events. Experimental results on both
industrial and public datasets clearly demonstrate that our model achieves
significantly better performance compared with state-of-the-art baselines.</span>

                    <span>Illegal vehicle parking is a common urban problem faced by major cities in
the world, as it incurs traffic jams, which lead to air pollution and traffic
accidents. The government highly relies on active human efforts to detect
illegal parking events. However, such an approach is extremely ineffective to
cover a large city since the police have to patrol over the entire city roads.

The massive and high-quality sharing bike trajectories from Mobike offer us a
unique opportunity to design a ubiquitous illegal parking detection approach,
as most of the illegal parking events happen at curbsides and have significant
impact on the bike users. The detection result can guide the patrol schedule,
i.e. send the patrol policemen to the region with higher illegal parking risks,
and further improve the patrol efficiency. Inspired by this idea, three main
components are employed in the proposed framework: 1)~{\em trajectory
pre-processing}, which filters outlier GPS points, performs map-matching, and
builds trajectory indexes; 2)~{\em illegal parking detection}, which models the
normal trajectories, extracts features from the evaluation trajectories, and
utilizes a distribution test-based method to discover the illegal parking
events; and 3)~{\em patrol scheduling}, which leverages the detection result as
reference context, and models the scheduling task as a multi-agent
reinforcement learning problem to guide the patrol police. Finally, extensive
experiments are presented to validate the effectiveness of illegal parking
detection, as well as the improvement of patrol efficiency.</span>

                    <span>We introduce several new datasets namely ImageNet-A/O and ImageNet-R as well
as a synthetic environment and testing suite we called CAOS. ImageNet-A/O allow
researchers to focus in on the blind spots remaining in ImageNet. ImageNet-R
was specifically created with the intention of tracking robust representation
as the representations are no longer simply natural but include artistic, and
other renditions. The CAOS suite is built off of CARLA simulator which allows
for the inclusion of anomalous objects and can create reproducible synthetic
environment and scenes for testing robustness. All of the datasets were created
for testing robustness and measuring progress in robustness. The datasets have
been used in various other works to measure their own progress in robustness
and allowing for tangential progress that does not focus exclusively on natural
accuracy.

Given these datasets, we created several novel methods that aim to advance
robustness research. We build off of simple baselines in the form of Maximum
Logit, and Typicality Score as well as create a novel data augmentation method
in the form of DeepAugment that improves on the aforementioned benchmarks.
Maximum Logit considers the logit values instead of the values after the
softmax operation, while a small change produces noticeable improvements. The
Typicality Score compares the output distribution to a posterior distribution
over classes. We show that this improves performance over the baseline in all
but the segmentation task. Speculating that perhaps at the pixel level the
semantic information of a pixel is less meaningful than that of class level
information. Finally the new augmentation technique of DeepAugment utilizes
neural networks to create augmentations on images that are radically different
than the traditional geometric and camera based transformations used
previously.</span>

                    <span>Recent advances in machine learning have largely benefited from the massive
accessible training data. However, large-scale data sharing has raised great
privacy concerns. In this work, we propose a novel privacy-preserving data
Generative model based on the PATE framework (G-PATE), aiming to train a
scalable differentially private data generator that preserves high generated
data utility. Our approach leverages generative adversarial nets to generate
data, combined with private aggregation among different discriminators to
ensure strong privacy guarantees. Compared to existing approaches, G-PATE
significantly improves the use of privacy budgets. In particular, we train a
student data generator with an ensemble of teacher discriminators and propose a
novel private gradient aggregation mechanism to ensure differential privacy on
all information that flows from teacher discriminators to the student
generator. In addition, with random projection and gradient discretization, the
proposed gradient aggregation mechanism is able to effectively deal with
high-dimensional gradient vectors. Theoretically, we prove that G-PATE ensures
differential privacy for the data generator. Empirically, we demonstrate the
superiority of G-PATE over prior work through extensive experiments. We show
that G-PATE is the first work being able to generate high-dimensional image
data with high data utility under limited privacy budgets ($\epsilon \le 1$).

                    <span>This work is focused on the pruning of some convolutional neural networks
(CNNs) and improving theirs efficiency on graphic processing units (GPU) by
using a direct sparse algorithm. The Nvidia deep neural network (cuDnn) library
is the most effective implementations of deep learning (DL) algorithms for
GPUs. GPUs are the most commonly used accelerators for deep learning
computations. One of the most common techniques for improving the efficiency of
CNN models is weight pruning and quantization. There are two main types of
pruning: structural and non-structural. The first enables much easier
acceleration on many type of accelerators, but with this type it is difficult
to achieve a sparsity level and accuracy as high as that obtained with the
second type. Non-structural pruning with retraining can generate a weight
tensors up to 90% or more of sparsity in some deep CNN models. In this article
the pruning algorithm is presented which makes it possible to achieve high
sparsity levels without accuracy drop. In the next stage the linear and
non-linear quantization is adapted for further time and footprint reduction.
This paper is an extended of previously published paper concerning effective
pruning techniques and present real models pruned with high sparsities and
reduced precision which can achieve better performance than the CuDnn library.</span>

                    <span>Approximate message passing (AMP) is a low-cost iterative
parameter-estimation technique for certain high-dimensional linear systems with
non-Gaussian distributions. However, AMP only applies to independent
identically distributed (IID) transform matrices, but may become unreliable
(e.g., perform poorly or even diverge) for other matrix ensembles, especially
for ill-conditioned ones. Orthogonal/vector AMP (OAMP/VAMP) was proposed for
general right-unitarily-invariant matrices to handle this difficulty. However,
the Bayes-optimal OAMP/VAMP (BO-OAMP/VAMP) requires a high-complexity linear
minimum mean square error (MMSE) estimator. This limits the application of
OAMP/VAMP to large-scale systems.

To solve the disadvantages of AMP and BO-OAMP/VAMP, this paper proposes a
memory AMP (MAMP) framework under an orthogonality principle, which guarantees
the asymptotic IID Gaussianity of estimation errors in MAMP. We present an
orthogonalization procedure for the local memory estimators to realize the
required orthogonality for MAMP. Furthermore, we propose a Bayes-optimal MAMP
(BO-MAMP), in which a long-memory matched filter is proposed for interference
suppression. The complexity of BO-MAMP is comparable to AMP. A state evolution
is derived to asymptotically characterize the performance of BO-MAMP. Based on
state evolution, the relaxation parameters and damping vector in BO-MAMP are
optimized. For all right-unitarily-invariant matrices, the state evolution of
the optimized BO-MAMP converges to the same fixed point as that of the
high-complexity BO-OAMP/VAMP and is Bayes-optimal if its state evolution has a
unique fixed point. Finally, simulations are provided to verify the validity
and accuracy of the theoretical results.</span>

                    <span>We study reinforcement learning (RL) with linear function approximation.
Existing algorithms for this problem only have high-probability regret and/or
Probably Approximately Correct (PAC) sample complexity guarantees, which cannot
guarantee the convergence to the optimal policy. In this paper, in order to
overcome the limitation of existing algorithms, we propose a new algorithm
called FLUTE, which enjoys uniform-PAC convergence to the optimal policy with
high probability. The uniform-PAC guarantee is the strongest possible guarantee
for reinforcement learning in the literature, which can directly imply both PAC
and high probability regret bounds, making our algorithm superior to all
existing algorithms with linear function approximation. At the core of our
algorithm is a novel minimax value function estimator and a multi-level
partition scheme to select the training samples from historical observations.
Both of these techniques are new and of independent interest.</span>

                    <span>Long ties, the social ties that bridge different communities, are widely
believed to play crucial roles in spreading novel information in social
networks. However, some existing network theories and prediction models
indicate that long ties might dissolve quickly or eventually become redundant,
thus putting into question the long-term value of long ties. Our empirical
analysis of real-world dynamic networks shows that contrary to such reasoning,
long ties are more likely to persist than other social ties, and that many of
them constantly function as social bridges without being embedded in local
networks. Using a novel cost-benefit analysis model combined with machine
learning, we show that long ties are highly beneficial, which instinctively
motivates people to expend extra effort to maintain them. This partly explains
why long ties are more persistent than what has been suggested by many existing
theories and models. Overall, our study suggests the need for social
interventions that can promote the formation of long ties, such as mixing
people with diverse backgrounds.</span>

                    <span>In this work, we develop practical user scheduling algorithms for downlink
bursty traffic with emphasis on user fairness. In contrast to the conventional
scheduling algorithms that either equally divides the transmission time slots
among users or maximizing some ratios without physcial meanings, we propose to
use the 5%-tile user data rate (5TUDR) as the metric to evaluate user fairness.
Since it is difficult to directly optimize 5TUDR, we first cast the problem
into the stochastic game framework and subsequently propose a Multi-Agent
Reinforcement Learning (MARL)-based algorithm to perform distributed
optimization on the resource block group (RBG) allocation. Furthermore, each
MARL agent is designed to take information measured by network counters from
multiple network layers (e.g. Channel Quality Indicator, Buffer size) as the
input states while the RBG allocation as action with a proposed reward function
designed to maximize 5TUDR. Extensive simulation is performed to show that the
proposed MARL-based scheduler can achieve fair scheduling while maintaining
good average network throughput as compared to conventional schedulers.</span>

                    <span>Graphs can model complicated interactions between entities, which naturally
emerge in many important applications. These applications can often be cast
into standard graph learning tasks, in which a crucial step is to learn
low-dimensional graph representations. Graph neural networks (GNNs) are
currently the most popular model in graph embedding approaches. However,
standard GNNs in the neighborhood aggregation paradigm suffer from limited
discriminative power in distinguishing \emph{high-order} graph structures as
opposed to \emph{low-order} structures. To capture high-order structures,
researchers have resorted to motifs and developed motif-based GNNs. However,
existing motif-based GNNs still often suffer from less discriminative power on
high-order structures. To overcome the above limitations, we propose Motif
Graph Neural Network (MGNN), a novel framework to better capture high-order
structures, hinging on our proposed motif redundancy minimization operator and
injective motif combination. First, MGNN produces a set of node representations
w.r.t. each motif. The next phase is our proposed redundancy minimization among
motifs which compares the motifs with each other and distills the features
unique to each motif. Finally, MGNN performs the updating of node
representations by combining multiple representations from different motifs. In
particular, to enhance the discriminative power, MGNN utilizes an injective
function to combine the representations w.r.t. different motifs. We further
show that our proposed architecture increases the expressive power of GNNs with
a theoretical analysis. We demonstrate that MGNN outperforms state-of-the-art
methods on seven public benchmarks on both node classification and graph
classification tasks.</span>

                    <span>Recently, Vision Transformer (ViT) has continuously established new
milestones in the computer vision field, while the high computation and memory
cost makes its propagation in industrial production difficult. Pruning, a
traditional model compression paradigm for hardware efficiency, has been widely
applied in various DNN structures. Nevertheless, it stays ambiguous on how to
perform exclusive pruning on the ViT structure. Considering three key points:
the structural characteristics, the internal data pattern of ViTs, and the
related edge device deployment, we leverage the input token sparsity and
propose a computation-aware soft pruning framework, which can be set up on
vanilla Transformers of both flatten and CNN-type structures, such as
Pooling-based ViT (PiT). More concretely, we design a dynamic attention-based
multi-head token selector, which is a lightweight module for adaptive
instance-wise token selection. We further introduce a soft pruning technique,
which integrates the less informative tokens generated by the selector module
into a package token that will participate in subsequent calculations rather
than being completely discarded. Our framework is bound to the trade-off
between accuracy and computation constraints of specific edge devices through
our proposed computation-aware training strategy. Experimental results show
that our framework significantly reduces the computation cost of ViTs while
maintaining comparable performance on image classification. Moreover, our
framework can guarantee the identified model to meet resource specifications of
mobile devices and FPGA, and even achieve the real-time execution of DeiT-T on
mobile platforms. For example, our method reduces the latency of DeiT-T to 26
ms (26%$\sim $41% superior to existing works) on the mobile device with
0.25%$\sim $4% higher top-1 accuracy on ImageNet. Our code will be released
soon.</span>

                    <span>Large scale datasets created from crowdsourced labels or openly available
data have become crucial to provide training data for large scale learning
algorithms. While these datasets are easier to acquire, the data are frequently
noisy and unreliable, which is motivating research on weakly supervised
learning techniques. In this paper we propose original ideas that help us to
leverage such datasets in the context of change detection. First, we propose
the guided anisotropic diffusion (GAD) algorithm, which improves semantic
segmentation results using the input images as guides to perform edge
preserving filtering. We then show its potential in two weakly-supervised
learning strategies tailored for change detection. The first strategy is an
iterative learning method that combines model optimisation and data cleansing
using GAD to extract the useful information from a large scale change detection
dataset generated from open vector data. The second one incorporates GAD within
a novel spatial attention layer that increases the accuracy of weakly
supervised networks trained to perform pixel-level predictions from image-level
labels. Improvements with respect to state-of-the-art are demonstrated on 4
different public datasets.</span>

in the thermal management of electronics. However, they come with some
limitations. To increase the effectiveness of traditional numerical approaches

                    <span>K-core decomposition is a commonly used metric to analyze graph structure or
study the relative importance of nodes in complex graphs. Recent years have
seen rapid growth in the scale of the graph, especially in industrial settings.
For example, our industrial partner runs popular social applications with
billions of users and is able to gather a rich set of user data. As a result,
applying K-core decomposition on large graphs has attracted more and more
attention from academics and the industry. A simple but effective method to
deal with large graphs is to train them in the distributed settings, and some
distributed K-core decomposition algorithms are also proposed. Despite their
effectiveness, we experimentally and theoretically observe that these
algorithms consume too many resources and become unstable on super-large-scale
graphs, especially when the given resources are limited. In this paper, we deal
with those super-large-scale graphs and propose a divide-and-conquer strategy
on top of the distributed K-core decomposition algorithm. We evaluate our
approach on three large graphs. The experimental results show that the
consumption of resources can be significantly reduced, and the calculation on
large-scale graphs becomes more stable than the existing methods. For example,
the distributed K-core decomposition algorithm can scale to a large graph with
136 billion edges without losing correctness with our divide-and-conquer
technique.</span>

                    <span>One of the main challenges of Topological Data Analysis (TDA) is to extract
features from persistent diagrams directly usable by machine learning
algorithms. Indeed, persistence diagrams are intrinsically (multi-)sets of
points in R2 and cannot be seen in a straightforward manner as vectors. In this
article, we introduce Persformer, the first Transformer neural network
architecture that accepts persistence diagrams as input. The Persformer
architecture significantly outperforms previous topological neural network
architectures on classical synthetic benchmark datasets. Moreover, it satisfies
a universal approximation theorem. This allows us to introduce the first
interpretability method for topological machine learning, which we explore in
two examples.</span>

                    <span>Could we automatically derive the score of a piano accompaniment based on the
audio of a pop song? This is the audio-to-symbolic arrangement problem we
tackle in this paper. A good arrangement model should not only consider the
audio content but also have prior knowledge of piano composition (so that the
generation &quot;sounds like&quot; the audio and meanwhile maintains musicality.) To this
end, we contribute a cross-modal representation-learning model, which 1)
extracts chord and melodic information from the audio, and 2) learns texture
representation from both audio and a corrupted ground truth arrangement. We
further introduce a tailored training strategy that gradually shifts the source
of texture information from corrupted score to audio. In the end, the
score-based texture posterior is reduced to a standard normal distribution, and
only audio is needed for inference. Experiments show that our model captures
major audio information and outperforms baselines in generation quality.</span>

                    <span>Objective: To determine if a realistic, but computationally efficient model
of the electrocardiogram can be used to pre-train a deep neural network (DNN)
with a wide range of morphologies and abnormalities specific to a given
condition - T-wave Alternans (TWA) as a result of Post-Traumatic Stress
Disorder, or PTSD - and significantly boost performance on a small database of
rare individuals.

Approach: Using a previously validated artificial ECG model, we generated
180,000 artificial ECGs with or without significant TWA, with varying heart
rate, breathing rate, TWA amplitude, and ECG morphology. A DNN, trained on over
70,000 patients to classify 25 different rhythms, was modified the output layer
to a binary class (TWA or no-TWA, or equivalently, PTSD or no-PTSD), and
transfer learning was performed on the artificial ECG. In a final transfer
learning step, the DNN was trained and cross-validated on ECG from 12 PTSD and
24 controls for all combinations of using the three databases.

Main results: The best performing approach (AUROC &#x3D; 0.77, Accuracy &#x3D; 0.72,
F1-score &#x3D; 0.64) was found by performing both transfer learning steps, using
the pre-trained arrhythmia DNN, the artificial data and the real PTSD-related
ECG data. Removing the artificial data from training led to the largest drop in
performance. Removing the arrhythmia data from training provided a modest, but
significant, drop in performance. The final model showed no significant drop in
performance on the artificial data, indicating no overfitting.

Significance: In healthcare, it is common to only have a small collection of
high-quality data and labels, or a larger database with much lower quality (and
less relevant) labels. The paradigm presented here, involving model-based
performance boosting, provides a solution through transfer learning on a large
realistic artificial database, and a partially relevant real database.</span>

                    <span>Designing manufacturing processes with high yield and strong reliability
relies on effective methods for rare event estimation. Genealogical importance
splitting reduces the variance of rare event probability estimators by
iteratively selecting and replicating realizations that are headed towards a
rare event. The replication step is difficult when applied to deterministic
systems where the initial conditions of the offspring realizations need to be
modified. Typically, a random perturbation is applied to the offspring to
differentiate their trajectory from the parent realization. However, this
random perturbation strategy may be effective for some systems while failing
for others, preventing variance reduction in the probability estimate. This
work seeks to address this limitation using a generative model such as a
Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) to generate perturbations that are
consistent with the attractor of the dynamical system. The proposed
GAN-assisted Importance SPlitting method (GANISP) improves the variance
reduction for the system targeted. An implementation of the method is available
in a companion repository (https://github.com/NREL/GANISP).</span>

                    <span>In the last decade, many deep learning models have been well trained and made
a great success in various fields of machine intelligence, especially for
computer vision and natural language processing. To better leverage the
potential of these well-trained models in intra-domain or cross-domain transfer
learning situations, knowledge distillation (KD) and domain adaptation (DA) are
proposed and become research highlights. They both aim to transfer useful
information from a well-trained model with original training data. However, the
original data is not always available in many cases due to privacy, copyright
or confidentiality. Recently, the data-free knowledge transfer paradigm has
attracted appealing attention as it deals with distilling valuable knowledge
from well-trained models without requiring to access to the training data. In
particular, it mainly consists of the data-free knowledge distillation (DFKD)
and source data-free domain adaptation (SFDA). On the one hand, DFKD aims to
transfer the intra-domain knowledge of original data from a cumbersome teacher
network to a compact student network for model compression and efficient
inference. On the other hand, the goal of SFDA is to reuse the cross-domain
knowledge stored in a well-trained source model and adapt it to a target
domain. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive survey on data-free knowledge
transfer from the perspectives of knowledge distillation and unsupervised
domain adaptation, to help readers have a better understanding of the current
research status and ideas. Applications and challenges of the two areas are
briefly reviewed, respectively. Furthermore, we provide some insights to the
subject of future research.</span>

                    <span>6G will move mobile networks towards increasing levels of complexity. To deal
with this complexity, optimization of network parameters is key to ensure high
performance and timely adaptivity to dynamic network environments. The
optimization of the antenna tilt provides a practical and cost-efficient method
to improve coverage and capacity in the network. Previous methods based on
Reinforcement Learning (RL) have shown great promise for tilt optimization by
learning adaptive policies outperforming traditional tilt optimization methods.
However, most existing RL methods are based on single-cell features
representation, which fails to fully characterize the agent state, resulting in
suboptimal performance. Also, most of such methods lack scalability, due to
state-action explosion, and generalization ability. In this paper, we propose a
Graph Attention Q-learning (GAQ) algorithm for tilt optimization. GAQ relies on
a graph attention mechanism to select relevant neighbors information, improve
the agent state representation, and update the tilt control policy based on a
history of observations using a Deep Q-Network (DQN). We show that GAQ
efficiently captures important network information and outperforms standard DQN
with local information by a large margin. In addition, we demonstrate its
ability to generalize to network deployments of different sizes and densities.</span>

                    <span>Generative models can be trained to emulate complex empirical data, but are
they useful to make predictions in the context of previously unobserved
environments? An intuitive idea to promote such extrapolation capabilities is
to have the architecture of such model reflect a causal graph of the true data
generating process, such that one can intervene on each node independently of
the others. However, the nodes of this graph are usually unobserved, leading to
overparameterization and lack of identifiability of the causal structure. We
develop a theoretical framework to address this challenging situation by
defining a weaker form of identifiability, based on the principle of
independence of mechanisms. We demonstrate on toy examples that classical
stochastic gradient descent can hinder the model&#x27;s extrapolation capabilities,
suggesting independence of mechanisms should be enforced explicitly during
training. Experiments on deep generative models trained on real world data
support these insights and illustrate how the extrapolation capabilities of
such models can be leveraged.</span>

                    <span>We consider Bayesian optimization of the output of a network of functions,
where each function takes as input the output of its parent nodes, and where
the network takes significant time to evaluate. Such problems arise, for
example, in reinforcement learning, engineering design, and manufacturing.
While the standard Bayesian optimization approach observes only the final
output, our approach delivers greater query efficiency by leveraging
information that the former ignores: intermediate output within the network.
This is achieved by modeling the nodes of the network using Gaussian processes
and choosing the points to evaluate using, as our acquisition function, the
expected improvement computed with respect to the implied posterior on the
objective. Although the non-Gaussian nature of this posterior prevents
computing our acquisition function in closed form, we show that it can be
efficiently maximized via sample average approximation. In addition, we prove
that our method is asymptotically consistent, meaning that it finds a globally
optimal solution as the number of evaluations grows to infinity, thus
generalizing previously known convergence results for the expected improvement.
Notably, this holds even though our method might not evaluate the domain
densely, instead leveraging problem structure to leave regions unexplored.
Finally, we show that our approach dramatically outperforms standard Bayesian
optimization methods in several synthetic and real-world problems.</span>

                    <span>In recent years, gradient based Meta-RL (GMRL) methods have achieved
remarkable successes in either discovering effective online hyperparameter for
one single task (Xu et al., 2018) or learning good initialisation for
multi-task transfer learning (Finn et al., 2017). Despite the empirical
successes, it is often neglected that computing meta gradients via vanilla
backpropagation is ill-defined. In this paper, we argue that the stochastic
meta-gradient estimation adopted by many existing MGRL methods are in fact
biased; the bias comes from two sources: 1) the compositional bias that is
inborn in the structure of compositional optimisation problems and 2) the bias
of multi-step Hessian estimation caused by direct automatic differentiation. To
better understand the meta gradient biases, we perform the first of its kind
study to quantify the amount for each of them. We start by providing a unifying
derivation for existing GMRL algorithms, and then theoretically analyse both
the bias and the variance of existing gradient estimation methods. On
understanding the underlying principles of bias, we propose two mitigation
solutions based on off-policy correction and multi-step Hessian estimation
techniques. Comprehensive ablation studies have been conducted and results
reveals: (1) The existence of these two biases and how they influence the
meta-gradient estimation when combined with different estimator/sample
size/step and learning rate. (2) The effectiveness of these mitigation
approaches for meta-gradient estimation and thereby the final return on two
practical Meta-RL algorithms: LOLA-DiCE and Meta-gradient Reinforcement
Learning.</span>

classification that are transferable to new, unseen classes. Recent results in
the literature show that representations learned by a single classifier over
many classes are competitive on few-shot learning problems with representations
learned by special-purpose algorithms designed for such problems. In this paper
we provide an explanation for this behavior based on the recently observed
phenomenon that the features learned by overparameterized classification
networks show an interesting clustering property, called neural collapse. We
demonstrate both theoretically and empirically that neural collapse generalizes
to new samples from the training classes, and -- more importantly -- to new
classes as well, allowing foundation models to provide feature maps that work
well in transfer learning and, specifically, in the few-shot setting.</span>

                    <span>In this work, we review and evaluate a body of deep learning knowledge
tracing (DLKT) models with openly available and widely-used data sets, and with
a novel data set of students learning to program. The evaluated DLKT models
have been reimplemented for assessing reproducibility and replicability of
previously reported results. We test different input and output layer
variations found in the compared models that are independent of the main
architectures of the models, and different maximum attempt count options that
have been implicitly and explicitly used in some studies. Several metrics are
used to reflect on the quality of the evaluated knowledge tracing models. The
evaluated knowledge tracing models include Vanilla-DKT, two Long Short-Term
Memory Deep Knowledge Tracing (LSTM-DKT) variants, two Dynamic Key-Value Memory
Network (DKVMN) variants, and Self-Attentive Knowledge Tracing (SAKT). We
evaluate logistic regression, Bayesian Knowledge Tracing (BKT) and simple
non-learning models as baselines. Our results suggest that the DLKT models in
general outperform non-DLKT models, and the relative differences between the
DLKT models are subtle and often vary between datasets. Our results also show
that naive models such as mean prediction can yield better performance than
more sophisticated knowledge tracing models, especially in terms of accuracy.
Further, our metric and hyperparameter analysis shows that the metric used to
select the best model hyperparameters has a noticeable effect on the
performance of the models, and that metric choice can affect model ranking. We
also study the impact of input and output layer variations, filtering out long
attempt sequences, and non-model properties such as randomness and hardware.
Finally, we discuss model performance replicability and related issues. Our
model implementations, evaluation code, and data are published as a part of

aimed to maximize the expected reward, which are thus useful in searching the
optimized candidate with the highest reward (function value) for diverse
applications (e.g., AlphaGo). However, in some typical application scenaios
such as drug discovery, the aim is to search a diverse set of candidates with
high reward. Here we propose a reversible upper confidence bound (rUCB)
algorithm for such a purpose, and demonstrate its application in virtual
screening upon intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs). It is shown that rUCB
greatly reduces the query times while achieving both high accuracy and low
performance loss.The rUCB may have potential application in multipoint

                    <span>Turbulence simulation with classical numerical solvers requires very
high-resolution grids to accurately resolve dynamics. Here we train learned
simulators at low spatial and temporal resolutions to capture turbulent
dynamics generated at high resolution. We show that our proposed model can
simulate turbulent dynamics more accurately than classical numerical solvers at
the same low resolutions across various scientifically relevant metrics. Our
model is trained end-to-end from data and is capable of learning a range of
challenging chaotic and turbulent dynamics at low resolution, including
trajectories generated by the state-of-the-art Athena++ engine. We show that
our simpler, general-purpose architecture outperforms various more specialized,
turbulence-specific architectures from the learned turbulence simulation
literature. In general, we see that learned simulators yield unstable
trajectories; however, we show that tuning training noise and temporal
downsampling solves this problem. We also find that while generalization beyond
the training distribution is a challenge for learned models, training noise,
convolutional architectures, and added loss constraints can help. Broadly, we
conclude that our learned simulator outperforms traditional solvers run on
coarser grids, and emphasize that simple design choices can offer stability and
robust generalization.</span>

                    <span>Deep graph clustering, which aims to reveal the underlying graph structure
and divide the nodes into different groups, has attracted intensive attention
in recent years. However, we observe that, in the process of node encoding,
existing methods suffer from representation collapse which tends to map all
data into the same representation. Consequently, the discriminative capability
of the node representation is limited, leading to unsatisfied clustering
performance. To address this issue, we propose a novel self-supervised deep
graph clustering method termed Dual Correlation Reduction Network (DCRN) by
reducing information correlation in a dual manner. Specifically, in our method,
we first design a siamese network to encode samples. Then by forcing the
cross-view sample correlation matrix and cross-view feature correlation matrix
to approximate two identity matrices, respectively, we reduce the information
correlation in the dual-level, thus improving the discriminative capability of
the resulting features. Moreover, in order to alleviate representation collapse
caused by over-smoothing in GCN, we introduce a propagation regularization term
to enable the network to gain long-distance information with the shallow
network structure. Extensive experimental results on six benchmark datasets
demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed DCRN against the existing
state-of-the-art methods.</span>

                    <span>Active learning (AL) is a machine learning algorithm that can achieve greater
accuracy with fewer labeled training instances, for having the ability to ask
oracles to label the most valuable unlabeled data chosen iteratively and
heuristically by query strategies. Scientific experiments nowadays, though
becoming increasingly automated, are still suffering from human involvement in
the designing process and the exhaustive search in the experimental space. This
article performs a retrospective study on a drug response dataset using the
proposed AL scheme comprised of the matrix factorization method of alternating
least square (ALS) and deep neural networks (DNN). This article also proposes
an AL query strategy based on expected loss minimization. As a result, the
retrospective study demonstrates that scientific experimental design, instead
of being manually set, can be optimized by AL, and the proposed query strategy
ELM sampling shows better experimental performance than other ones such as
random sampling and uncertainty sampling.</span>

                    <span>Each grid block in a 3D geological model requires a rock type that represents
all physical and chemical properties of that block. The properties that
classify rock types are lithology, permeability, and capillary pressure.
Scientists and engineers determined these properties using conventional
laboratory measurements, which embedded destructive methods to the sample or
altered some of its properties (i.e., wettability, permeability, and porosity)
because the measurements process includes sample crushing, fluid flow, or fluid
saturation. Lately, Digital Rock Physics (DRT) has emerged to quantify these
properties from micro-Computerized Tomography (uCT) and Magnetic Resonance
Imaging (MRI) images. However, the literature did not attempt rock typing in a
wholly digital context. We propose performing Digital Rock Typing (DRT) by: (1)
integrating the latest DRP advances in a novel process that honors digital rock
properties determination, while; (2) digitalizing the latest rock typing
approaches in carbonate, and (3) introducing a novel carbonate rock typing
process that utilizes computer vision capabilities to provide more insight
about the heterogeneous carbonate rock texture.</span>

                    <span>Suppose we have a black-box function (e.g., deep neural network) that takes
an image as input and outputs a value that indicates preference. How can we
retrieve optimal images with respect to this function from an external database
on the Internet? Standard retrieval problems in the literature (e.g., item
recommendations) assume that an algorithm has full access to the set of items.
In other words, such algorithms are designed for service providers. In this
paper, we consider the retrieval problem under different assumptions.
Specifically, we consider how users with limited access to an image database
can retrieve images using their own black-box functions. This formulation
enables a flexible and finer-grained image search defined by each user. We
assume the user can access the database through a search query with tight API
limits. Therefore, a user needs to efficiently retrieve optimal images in terms
of the number of queries. We propose an efficient retrieval algorithm Tiara for
this problem. In the experiments, we confirm that our proposed method performs
better than several baselines under various settings.</span>

                    <span>Rhetorical Frames in AI can be thought of as expressions that describe AI
development as a competition between two or more actors, such as governments or
companies. Examples of such Frames include robotic arms race, AI rivalry,
technological supremacy, cyberwarfare dominance and 5G race. Detection of
Rhetorical Frames from open sources can help us track the attitudes of
governments or companies towards AI, specifically whether attitudes are
becoming more cooperative or competitive over time. Given the rapidly
increasing volumes of open sources (online news media, twitter, blogs), it is
difficult for subject matter experts to identify Rhetorical Frames in (near)
real-time. Moreover, these sources are in general unstructured (noisy) and
therefore, detecting Frames from these sources will require state-of-the-art
text classification techniques. In this paper, we develop RheFrameDetect, a
text classification system for (near) real-time capture of Rhetorical Frames
from open sources. Given an input document, RheFrameDetect employs text
classification techniques at multiple levels (document level and paragraph
level) to identify all occurrences of Frames used in the discussion of AI. We
performed extensive evaluation of the text classification techniques used in
RheFrameDetect against human annotated Frames from multiple news sources. To
further demonstrate the effectiveness of RheFrameDetect, we show multiple case
studies depicting the Frames identified by RheFrameDetect compared against
human annotated Frames.</span>

                    <span>During the SARS-Cov-2 pandemic, mask-wearing became an effective tool to
prevent spreading and contracting the virus. The ability to monitor the
mask-wearing rate in the population would be useful for determining public
health strategies against the virus. However, artificial intelligence
technologies for detecting face masks have not been deployed at a large scale
in real-life to measure the mask-wearing rate in public. In this paper, we
present a two-step face mask detection approach consisting of two separate
modules: 1) face detection and alignment and 2) face mask classification. This
approach allowed us to experiment with different combinations of face detection
and face mask classification modules. More specifically, we experimented with
PyramidKey and RetinaFace as face detectors while maintaining a lightweight
backbone for the face mask classification module. Moreover, we also provide a
relabeled annotation of the test set of the AIZOO dataset, where we rectified
the incorrect labels for some face images. The evaluation results on the AIZOO
and Moxa 3K datasets showed that the proposed face mask detection pipeline
surpassed the state-of-the-art methods. The proposed pipeline also yielded a
higher mAP on the relabeled test set of the AIZOO dataset than the original
test set. Since we trained the proposed model using in-the-wild face images, we
can successfully deploy our model to monitor the mask-wearing rate using public
CCTV images.</span>

                    <span>Domain adaptation tasks such as cross-domain sentiment classification aim to
utilize existing labeled data in the source domain and unlabeled or few labeled
data in the target domain to improve the performance in the target domain via
reducing the shift between the data distributions. Existing cross-domain
sentiment classification methods need to distinguish pivots, i.e., the
domain-shared sentiment words, and non-pivots, i.e., the domain-specific
sentiment words, for excellent adaptation performance. In this paper, we first
design a Category Attention Network (CAN), and then propose a model named
CAN-CNN to integrate CAN and a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). On the one
hand, the model regards pivots and non-pivots as unified category attribute
words and can automatically capture them to improve the domain adaptation
performance; on the other hand, the model makes an attempt at interpretability
to learn the transferred category attribute words. Specifically, the
optimization objective of our model has three different components: 1) the
supervised classification loss; 2) the distributions loss of category feature
weights; 3) the domain invariance loss. Finally, the proposed model is
evaluated on three public sentiment analysis datasets and the results
demonstrate that CAN-CNN can outperform other various baseline methods.</span>

fields where data is fundamentally represented as graphs (e.g., chemistry,
biology, recommendation systems). In this vein, communication networks comprise
many fundamental components that are naturally represented in a
graph-structured manner (e.g., topology, configurations, traffic flows). This
position article presents GNNs as a fundamental tool for modeling, control and
management of communication networks. GNNs represent a new generation of
data-driven models that can accurately learn and reproduce the complex
behaviors behind real networks. As a result, such models can be applied to a
wide variety of networking use cases, such as planning, online optimization, or
troubleshooting. The main advantage of GNNs over traditional neural networks
lies in its unprecedented generalization capabilities when applied to other
networks and configurations unseen during training, which is a critical feature
for achieving practical data-driven solutions for networking. This article
comprises a brief tutorial on GNNs and their possible applications to
communication networks. To showcase the potential of this technology, we

                    <span>The transformation of conventional power networks into smart grids with the
heavy penetration level of renewable energy resources, particularly
grid-connected Photovoltaic (PV) systems, has increased the need for efficient
fault identification systems. Malfunctioning any single component in
grid-connected PV systems may lead to grid instability and other serious
consequences, showing that a reliable fault identification system is the utmost
requirement for ensuring operational integrity. Therefore, this paper presents
a novel fault identification approach based on statistical signatures of PV
operational states. These signatures are unique because each fault has a
different nature and distinctive impact on the electrical system. Thus, the
Random Forest Classifier trained on these extracted signatures showed 100%
accuracy in identifying all types of faults. Furthermore, the performance
comparison of the proposed framework with other Machine Learning classifiers
depicts its credibility. Moreover, to elevate user trust in the predicted
outcomes, SHAP (Shapley Additive Explanation) was utilized during the training
phase to extract a complete model response (global explanation). This extracted
global explanation can help in the assessment of predicted outcomes credibility
by decoding each prediction in terms of features contribution. Hence, the
proposed explainable signature-based fault identification technique is highly
credible and fulfills all the requirements of smart grids.</span>

                    <span>Stochastic and soft optimal policies resulting from entropy-regularized
Markov decision processes (ER-MDP) are desirable for exploration and imitation
learning applications. Motivated by the fact that such policies are sensitive
with respect to the state transition probabilities, and the estimation of these
probabilities may be inaccurate, we study a robust version of the ER-MDP model,
where the stochastic optimal policies are required to be robust with respect to
the ambiguity in the underlying transition probabilities. Our work is at the
crossroads of two important schemes in reinforcement learning (RL), namely,
robust MDP and entropy regularized MDP. We show that essential properties that
hold for the non-robust ER-MDP and robust unregularized MDP models also hold in
our settings, making the robust ER-MDP problem tractable. We show how our
framework and results can be integrated into different algorithmic schemes
including value or (modified) policy iteration, which would lead to new robust
RL and inverse RL algorithms to handle uncertainties. Analyses on computational
complexity and error propagation under conventional uncertainty settings are

TD-learning is a linear stochastic iterative algorithm to estimate the value
function of a given policy for a Markov decision process, which is one of the
most popular and fundamental reinforcement learning algorithms. While there has
been a series of successful works in theoretical analysis of TD-learning, it
was not until recently that researchers found some guarantees on its
statistical efficiency. In this paper, we propose a control theoretic

                    <span>We study the problem of learning a good set of policies, so that when
combined together, they can solve a wide variety of unseen reinforcement
learning tasks with no or very little new data. Specifically, we consider the
framework of generalized policy evaluation and improvement, in which the
rewards for all tasks of interest are assumed to be expressible as a linear
combination of a fixed set of features. We show theoretically that, under
certain assumptions, having access to a specific set of diverse policies, which
we call a set of independent policies, can allow for instantaneously achieving
high-level performance on all possible downstream tasks which are typically
more complex than the ones on which the agent was trained. Based on this
theoretical analysis, we propose a simple algorithm that iteratively constructs
this set of policies. In addition to empirically validating our theoretical
results, we compare our approach with recently proposed diverse policy set
construction methods and show that, while others fail, our approach is able to
build a behavior basis that enables instantaneous transfer to all possible
downstream tasks. We also show empirically that having access to a set of
independent policies can better bootstrap the learning process on downstream
tasks where the new reward function cannot be described as a linear combination
of the features. Finally, we demonstrate that this policy set can be useful in
a realistic lifelong reinforcement learning setting.</span>

                    <span>Support vector machine (SVM) is a powerful classification method that has
achieved great success in many fields. Since its performance can be seriously
impaired by redundant covariates, model selection techniques are widely used
for SVM with high dimensional covariates. As an alternative to model selection,
significant progress has been made in the area of model averaging in the past
decades. Yet no frequentist model averaging method was considered for SVM. This
work aims to fill the gap and to propose a frequentist model averaging
procedure for SVM which selects the optimal weight by cross validation. Even
when the number of covariates diverges at an exponential rate of the sample
size, we show asymptotic optimality of the proposed method in the sense that
the ratio of its hinge loss to the lowest possible loss converges to one. We
also derive the convergence rate which provides more insights to model
averaging. Compared to model selection methods of SVM which require a tedious
but critical task of tuning parameter selection, the model averaging method
avoids the task and shows promising performances in the empirical studies.</span>

                    <span>In this paper, we focus on the decentralized optimization problem over the
Stiefel manifold, which is defined on a connected network of $d$ agents. The
objective is an average of $d$ local functions, and each function is privately
held by an agent and encodes its data. The agents can only communicate with
their neighbors in a collaborative effort to solve this problem. In existing
methods, multiple rounds of communications are required to guarantee the
convergence, giving rise to high communication costs. In contrast, this paper
proposes a decentralized algorithm, called DESTINY, which only invokes a single
round of communications per iteration. DESTINY combines gradient tracking
techniques with a novel approximate augmented Lagrangian function. The global
convergence to stationary points is rigorously established. Comprehensive
numerical experiments demonstrate that DESTINY has a strong potential to
deliver a cutting-edge performance in solving a variety of testing problems.</span>

                    <span>The current work intends to study the performance of the Hierarchical
Temporal Memory(HTM) theory for automated classification of text as well as
documents. HTM is a biologically inspired theory based on the working
principles of the human neocortex. The current study intends to provide an
alternative framework for document categorization using the Spatial Pooler
learning algorithm in the HTM Theory. As HTM accepts only a stream of binary
data as input, Latent Semantic Indexing(LSI) technique is used for extracting
the top features from the input and converting them into binary format. The
Spatial Pooler algorithm converts the binary input into sparse patterns with
similar input text having overlapping spatial patterns making it easy for
classifying the patterns into categories. The results obtained prove that HTM
theory, although is in its nascent stages, performs at par with most of the
popular machine learning based classifiers.</span>

                    <span>Classification predictive modeling involves the accurate assignment of
observations in a dataset to target classes or categories. There is an
increasing growth of real-world classification problems with severely
imbalanced class distributions. In this case, minority classes have much fewer
observations to learn from than those from majority classes. Despite this
sparsity, a minority class is often considered the more interesting class yet
developing a scientific learning algorithm suitable for the observations
presents countless challenges. In this article, we suggest a novel multi-class
classification algorithm specialized to handle severely imbalanced classes
based on the method we refer to as SAMME.C2. It blends the flexible mechanics
of the boosting techniques from SAMME algorithm, a multi-class classifier, and
Ada.C2 algorithm, a cost-sensitive binary classifier designed to address highly
class imbalances. Not only do we provide the resulting algorithm but we also
establish scientific and statistical formulation of our proposed SAMME.C2
algorithm. Through numerical experiments examining various degrees of
classifier difficulty, we demonstrate consistent superior performance of our
proposed model.</span>

                    <span>Various applications of farm animal imaging are based on the estimation of
weights of certain body parts and cuts from the CT images of animals. In many
cases, the complexity of the problem is increased by the enormous variability
of postures in CT images due to the scanning of non-sedated, living animals. In
this paper, we propose a general and robust approach for the estimation of the
weights of cuts and body parts from the CT images of (possibly) living animals.
We adapt multi-atlas based segmentation driven by elastic registration and
joint feature and model selection for the regression component to cape with the
large number of features and low number of samples. The proposed technique is
evaluated and illustrated through real applications in rabbit breeding
programs, showing r^2 scores 12% higher than previous techniques and methods
that used to drive the selection so far. The proposed technique is easily
adaptable to similar problems, consequently, it is shared in an open source
software package for the benefit of the community.</span>

                    <span>Heterogeneous graph neural networks (HGNNs) have been blossoming in recent
years, but the unique data processing and evaluation setups used by each work
obstruct a full understanding of their advancements. In this work, we present a
systematical reproduction of 12 recent HGNNs by using their official codes,
datasets, settings, and hyperparameters, revealing surprising findings about
the progress of HGNNs. We find that the simple homogeneous GNNs, e.g., GCN and
GAT, are largely underestimated due to improper settings. GAT with proper
inputs can generally match or outperform all existing HGNNs across various
scenarios. To facilitate robust and reproducible HGNN research, we construct
the Heterogeneous Graph Benchmark (HGB), consisting of 11 diverse datasets with
three tasks. HGB standardizes the process of heterogeneous graph data splits,
feature processing, and performance evaluation. Finally, we introduce a simple
but very strong baseline Simple-HGN--which significantly outperforms all
previous models on HGB--to accelerate the advancement of HGNNs in the future.</span>

                    <span>Quantizing deep neural networks (DNNs) has been a promising solution for
deploying deep neural networks on embedded devices. However, most of the
existing methods do not quantize gradients, and the process of quantizing DNNs
still has a lot of floating-point operations, which hinders the further
applications of quantized DNNs. To solve this problem, we propose a new
heuristic method based on cooperative coevolution for quantizing DNNs. Under
the framework of cooperative coevolution, we use the estimation of distribution
algorithm to search for the low-bits weights. Specifically, we first construct
an initial quantized network from a pre-trained network instead of random
initialization and then start searching from it by restricting the search
space. So far, the problem is the largest discrete problem known to be solved
by evolutionary algorithms. Experiments show that our method can train 4 bit

than text. However, in order for content creators to produce videos with a high
click-through rate, much editing is needed to match the footage to the music.
This posts additional challenges for more amateur video makers. Therefore, we
propose a novel attention-based model VMT (Video-Music Transformer) that
automatically generates piano scores from video frames. Using music generated
from models also prevent potential copyright infringements that often come with
using existing music. To the best of our knowledge, there is no work besides
the proposed VMT that aims to compose music for video. Additionally, there
lacks a dataset with aligned video and symbolic music. We release a new dataset
composed of over 7 hours of piano scores with fine alignment between pop music
videos and MIDI files. We conduct experiments with human evaluation on VMT,
SeqSeq model (our baseline), and the original piano version soundtrack. VMT
achieves consistent improvements over the baseline on music smoothness and
video relevance. In particular, with the relevance scores and our case study,
our model has shown the capability of multimodality on frame-level actors&#x27;
movement for music generation. Our VMT model, along with the new dataset,

                    <span>Image synthesis and image recognition have witnessed remarkable progress, but
often at the expense of computationally expensive training and inference.
Learning lightweight yet expressive deep model has emerged as an important and
interesting direction. Inspired by the well-known split-transform-aggregate
design heuristic in the Inception building block, this paper proposes a
Skip-Layer Inception Module (SLIM) that facilitates efficient learning of image
synthesis models, and a same-layer variant (dubbed as SLIM too) as a stronger
alternative to the well-known ResNeXts for image recognition. In SLIM, the
input feature map is first split into a number of groups (e.g., 4).Each group
is then transformed to a latent style vector(via channel-wise attention) and a
latent spatial mask (via spatial attention). The learned latent masks and
latent style vectors are aggregated to modulate the target feature map. For
generative learning, SLIM is built on a recently proposed lightweight
Generative Adversarial Networks (i.e., FastGANs) which present a skip-layer
excitation(SLE) module. For few-shot image synthesis tasks, the proposed SLIM
achieves better performance than the SLE work and other related methods. For
one-shot image synthesis tasks, it shows stronger capability of preserving
images structures than prior arts such as the SinGANs. For image classification
tasks, the proposed SLIM is used as a drop-in replacement for convolution
layers in ResNets (resulting in ResNeXt-like models) and achieves better
accuracy in theImageNet-1000 dataset, with significantly smaller model
complexity</span>

                    <span>Deep learning is pervasive in our daily life, including self-driving cars,
virtual assistants, social network services, healthcare services, face
recognition, etc. However, deep neural networks demand substantial compute
resources during training and inference. The machine learning community has
mainly focused on model-level optimizations such as architectural compression
of deep learning models, while the system community has focused on
implementation-level optimization. In between, various arithmetic-level
optimization techniques have been proposed in the arithmetic community. This
article provides a survey on resource-efficient deep learning techniques in
terms of model-, arithmetic-, and implementation-level techniques and
identifies the research gaps for resource-efficient deep learning techniques
across the three different level techniques. Our survey clarifies the influence
from higher to lower-level techniques based on our resource-efficiency metric
definition and discusses the future trend for resource-efficient deep learning
research.</span>

distinguish them from standard adversarial perturbations. Specifically, we show
that targeted UAPs generated by projected gradient descent exhibit two

standard targeted adversarial perturbations lack. We also demonstrate that UAPs
contain significantly less signal for generalization than standard adversarial
perturbations -- that is, UAPs leverage non-robust features to a smaller extent

                    <span>In this thesis, we address the problem of estimating the 6D pose of rigid
objects from a single RGB or RGB-D input image, assuming that 3D models of the
objects are available. This problem is of great importance to many application
fields such as robotic manipulation, augmented reality, and autonomous driving.
First, we propose EPOS, a method for 6D object pose estimation from an RGB
image. The key idea is to represent an object by compact surface fragments and
predict the probability distribution of corresponding fragments at each pixel
of the input image by a neural network. Each pixel is linked with a
data-dependent number of fragments, which allows systematic handling of
symmetries, and the 6D poses are estimated from the links by a RANSAC-based
fitting method. EPOS outperformed all RGB and most RGB-D and D methods on
several standard datasets. Second, we present HashMatch, an RGB-D method that
slides a window over the input image and searches for a match against
templates, which are pre-generated by rendering 3D object models in different
orientations. The method applies a cascade of evaluation stages to each window
location, which avoids exhaustive matching against all templates. Third, we
propose ObjectSynth, an approach to synthesize photorealistic images of 3D
object models for training methods based on neural networks. The images yield
substantial improvements compared to commonly used images of objects rendered
on top of random photographs. Fourth, we introduce T-LESS, the first dataset
for 6D object pose estimation that includes 3D models and RGB-D images of
industry-relevant objects. Fifth, we define BOP, a benchmark that captures the
status quo in the field. BOP comprises eleven datasets in a unified format, an
evaluation methodology, an online evaluation system, and public challenges held
at international workshops organized at the ICCV and ECCV conferences.</span>

                    <span>Branch prediction is an architectural feature that speeds up the execution of
branch instruction on pipeline processors and reduces the cost of branching.
Recent advancements of Deep Learning (DL) in the post Moore&#x27;s Law era is
accelerating areas of automated chip design, low-power computer architectures,
and much more. Traditional computer architecture design and algorithms could
benefit from dynamic predictors based on deep learning algorithms which learns
from experience by optimizing its parameters on large number of data. In this
survey paper, we focus on traditional branch prediction algorithms, analyzes
its limitations, and presents a literature survey of how deep learning
techniques can be applied to create dynamic branch predictors capable of
predicting conditional branch instructions. Prior surveys in this field focus
on dynamic branch prediction techniques based on neural network perceptrons. We
plan to improve the survey based on latest research in DL and advanced Machine
Learning (ML) based branch predictors.</span>

                    <span>Linear dynamical systems are canonical models for learning-based control of
plants with uncertain dynamics. The setting consists of a stochastic
differential equation that captures the state evolution of the plant
understudy, while the true dynamics matrices are unknown and need to be learned
from the observed data of state trajectory. An important issue is to ensure
that the system is stabilized and destabilizing control actions due to model
uncertainties are precluded as soon as possible. A reliable stabilization
procedure for this purpose that can effectively learn from unstable data to
stabilize the system in a finite time is not currently available. In this work,
we propose a novel Bayesian learning algorithm that stabilizes unknown
continuous-time stochastic linear systems. The presented algorithm is flexible
and exposes effective stabilization performance after a remarkably short time
period of interacting with the system.</span>

                    <span>We study reinforcement learning (RL) with linear function approximation.
Existing algorithms for this problem only have high-probability regret and/or
Probably Approximately Correct (PAC) sample complexity guarantees, which cannot
guarantee the convergence to the optimal policy. In this paper, in order to
overcome the limitation of existing algorithms, we propose a new algorithm
called FLUTE, which enjoys uniform-PAC convergence to the optimal policy with
high probability. The uniform-PAC guarantee is the strongest possible guarantee
for reinforcement learning in the literature, which can directly imply both PAC
and high probability regret bounds, making our algorithm superior to all
existing algorithms with linear function approximation. At the core of our
algorithm is a novel minimax value function estimator and a multi-level
partition scheme to select the training samples from historical observations.
Both of these techniques are new and of independent interest.</span>

                    <span>Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) provides asymptotically consistent estimates
of intractable posterior expectations as the number of iterations tends to
infinity. However, in large data applications, MCMC can be computationally
expensive per iteration. This has catalyzed interest in sampling methods such
as approximate MCMC, which trade off asymptotic consistency for improved
computational speed. In this article, we propose estimators based on couplings
of Markov chains to assess the quality of such asymptotically biased sampling
methods. The estimators give empirical upper bounds of the Wassertein distance
between the limiting distribution of the asymptotically biased sampling method
and the original target distribution of interest. We establish theoretical
guarantees for our upper bounds and show that our estimators can remain
effective in high dimensions. We apply our quality measures to stochastic
gradient MCMC, variational Bayes, and Laplace approximations for tall data and
to approximate MCMC for Bayesian logistic regression in 4500 dimensions and
Bayesian linear regression in 50000 dimensions.</span>

                    <span>We consider a high-dimensional model in which variables are observed over
time and space. The model consists of a spatio-temporal regression containing a
time lag and a spatial lag of the dependent variable. Unlike classical spatial
autoregressive models, we do not rely on a predetermined spatial interaction
matrix, but infer all spatial interactions from the data. Assuming sparsity, we
estimate the spatial and temporal dependence fully data-driven by penalizing a
set of Yule-Walker equations. This regularization can be left unstructured, but
we also propose customized shrinkage procedures when observations originate
from spatial grids (e.g. satellite images). Finite sample error bounds are
derived and estimation consistency is established in an asymptotic framework
wherein the sample size and the number of spatial units diverge jointly.
Exogenous variables can be included as well. A simulation exercise shows strong
finite sample performance compared to competing procedures. As an empirical
application, we model satellite measured NO2 concentrations in London. Our
approach delivers forecast improvements over a competitive benchmark and we
discover evidence for strong spatial interactions.</span>

                    <span>Generative models can be trained to emulate complex empirical data, but are
they useful to make predictions in the context of previously unobserved
environments? An intuitive idea to promote such extrapolation capabilities is
to have the architecture of such model reflect a causal graph of the true data
generating process, such that one can intervene on each node independently of
the others. However, the nodes of this graph are usually unobserved, leading to
overparameterization and lack of identifiability of the causal structure. We
develop a theoretical framework to address this challenging situation by
defining a weaker form of identifiability, based on the principle of
independence of mechanisms. We demonstrate on toy examples that classical
stochastic gradient descent can hinder the model&#x27;s extrapolation capabilities,
suggesting independence of mechanisms should be enforced explicitly during
training. Experiments on deep generative models trained on real world data
support these insights and illustrate how the extrapolation capabilities of
such models can be leveraged.</span>

                    <span>Score-based generative models (SGMs) have demonstrated remarkable synthesis
quality. SGMs rely on a diffusion process that gradually perturbs the data
towards a tractable distribution, while the generative model learns to denoise.
The complexity of this denoising task is, apart from the data distribution
itself, uniquely determined by the diffusion process. We argue that current
SGMs employ overly simplistic diffusions, leading to unnecessarily complex
denoising processes, which limit generative modeling performance. Based on
connections to statistical mechanics, we propose a novel critically-damped
Langevin diffusion (CLD) and show that CLD-based SGMs achieve superior
performance. CLD can be interpreted as running a joint diffusion in an extended
space, where the auxiliary variables can be considered &quot;velocities&quot; that are
coupled to the data variables as in Hamiltonian dynamics. We derive a novel
score matching objective for CLD and show that the model only needs to learn
the score function of the conditional distribution of the velocity given data,
an easier task than learning scores of the data directly. We also derive a new
sampling scheme for efficient synthesis from CLD-based diffusion models. We
find that CLD outperforms previous SGMs in synthesis quality for similar
network architectures and sampling compute budgets. We show that our novel
sampler for CLD significantly outperforms solvers such as Euler--Maruyama. Our
framework provides new insights into score-based denoising diffusion models and
can be readily used for high-resolution image synthesis. Project page and code:

have achieved scalable Gaussian process inference with highly accurate point

struggle with numerical instabilities in learning kernel hyperparameters, and
poor test likelihoods. By investigating CG tolerance, preconditioner rank, and
Lanczos decomposition rank, we provide a particularly simple prescription to
correct these issues: we recommend that one should use a small CG tolerance
($\epsilon \leq 0.01$) and a large root decomposition size ($r \geq 5000$).
Moreover, we show that L-BFGS-B is a compelling optimizer for Iterative GPs,

focus on methods suited for high dimensional optimization. We build intuition
on quadratic models to figure out which methods are suited for non-convex
optimization, and develop convergence proofs on convex functions for this
selection of methods. With this theoretical foundation for stochastic gradient
descent and momentum methods, we try to explain why the methods used commonly
in the machine learning field are so successful. Besides explaining successful
heuristics, the last chapter also provides a less extensive review of more
theoretical methods, which are not quite as popular in practice. So in some

                    <span>We study the model-based reward-free reinforcement learning with linear
function approximation for episodic Markov decision processes (MDPs). In this
setting, the agent works in two phases. In the exploration phase, the agent
interacts with the environment and collects samples without the reward. In the
planning phase, the agent is given a specific reward function and uses samples
collected from the exploration phase to learn a good policy. We propose a new
provably efficient algorithm, called UCRL-RFE under the Linear Mixture MDP
assumption, where the transition probability kernel of the MDP can be
parameterized by a linear function over certain feature mappings defined on the
triplet of state, action, and next state. We show that to obtain an
$\epsilon$-optimal policy for arbitrary reward function, UCRL-RFE needs to
sample at most $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(H^5d^2\epsilon^{-2})$ episodes during the
exploration phase. Here, $H$ is the length of the episode, $d$ is the dimension
of the feature mapping. We also propose a variant of UCRL-RFE using
Bernstein-type bonus and show that it needs to sample at most
$\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(H^4d(H + d)\epsilon^{-2})$ to achieve an
$\epsilon$-optimal policy. By constructing a special class of linear Mixture
MDPs, we also prove that for any reward-free algorithm, it needs to sample at
least $\tilde \Omega(H^2d\epsilon^{-2})$ episodes to obtain an
$\epsilon$-optimal policy. Our upper bound matches the lower bound in terms of
the dependence on $\epsilon$ and the dependence on $d$ if $H \ge d$.</span>

                    <span>A/B testing, or online experiment is a standard business strategy to compare
a new product with an old one in pharmaceutical, technological, and traditional
industries. Major challenges arise in online experiments of two-sided
marketplace platforms (e.g., Uber) where there is only one unit that receives a
sequence of treatments over time. In those experiments, the treatment at a
given time impacts current outcome as well as future outcomes. The aim of this
paper is to introduce a reinforcement learning framework for carrying A/B
testing in these experiments, while characterizing the long-term treatment
effects. Our proposed testing procedure allows for sequential monitoring and
online updating. It is generally applicable to a variety of treatment designs
in different industries. In addition, we systematically investigate the
theoretical properties (e.g., size and power) of our testing procedure.
Finally, we apply our framework to both simulated data and a real-world data
example obtained from a technological company to illustrate its advantage over
the current practice. A Python implementation of our test is available at

                    <span>Recent advances in machine learning have largely benefited from the massive
accessible training data. However, large-scale data sharing has raised great
privacy concerns. In this work, we propose a novel privacy-preserving data
Generative model based on the PATE framework (G-PATE), aiming to train a
scalable differentially private data generator that preserves high generated
data utility. Our approach leverages generative adversarial nets to generate
data, combined with private aggregation among different discriminators to
ensure strong privacy guarantees. Compared to existing approaches, G-PATE
significantly improves the use of privacy budgets. In particular, we train a
student data generator with an ensemble of teacher discriminators and propose a
novel private gradient aggregation mechanism to ensure differential privacy on
all information that flows from teacher discriminators to the student
generator. In addition, with random projection and gradient discretization, the
proposed gradient aggregation mechanism is able to effectively deal with
high-dimensional gradient vectors. Theoretically, we prove that G-PATE ensures
differential privacy for the data generator. Empirically, we demonstrate the
superiority of G-PATE over prior work through extensive experiments. We show
that G-PATE is the first work being able to generate high-dimensional image
data with high data utility under limited privacy budgets ($\epsilon \le 1$).

                    <span>We propose to model matrix time series based on a tensor CP-decomposition.
Instead of using an iterative algorithm which is the standard practice for
estimating CP-decompositions, we propose a new and one-pass estimation
procedure based on a generalized eigenanalysis constructed from the serial
dependence structure of the underlying process. A key idea of the new procedure
is to project a generalized eigenequation defined in terms of rank-reduced
matrices to a lower-dimensional one with full-ranked matrices, to avoid the
intricacy of the former of which the number of eigenvalues can be zero, finite
and infinity. The asymptotic theory has been established under a general
setting without the stationarity. It shows, for example, that all the component
coefficient vectors in the CP-decomposition are estimated consistently with the
different error rates, depending on the relative sizes between the dimensions
of time series and the sample size. The proposed model and the estimation
method are further illustrated with both simulated and real data; showing
effective dimension-reduction in modelling and forecasting matrix time series.</span>

                    <span>Adversarial training is so far the most effective strategy in defending
against adversarial examples. However, it suffers from high computational costs
due to the iterative adversarial attacks in each training step. Recent studies
show that it is possible to achieve fast Adversarial Training by performing a
single-step attack with random initialization. However, such an approach still
lags behind state-of-the-art adversarial training algorithms on both stability
and model robustness. In this work, we develop a new understanding towards Fast
Adversarial Training, by viewing random initialization as performing randomized
smoothing for better optimization of the inner maximization problem. Following
this new perspective, we also propose a new initialization strategy, backward
smoothing, to further improve the stability and model robustness over
single-step robust training methods. Experiments on multiple benchmarks
demonstrate that our method achieves similar model robustness as the original
TRADES method while using much less training time ($\sim$3x improvement with
the same training schedule).</span>

                    <span>Linear dynamical systems are canonical models for learning-based control of
plants with uncertain dynamics. The setting consists of a stochastic
differential equation that captures the state evolution of the plant
understudy, while the true dynamics matrices are unknown and need to be learned
from the observed data of state trajectory. An important issue is to ensure
that the system is stabilized and destabilizing control actions due to model
uncertainties are precluded as soon as possible. A reliable stabilization
procedure for this purpose that can effectively learn from unstable data to
stabilize the system in a finite time is not currently available. In this work,
we propose a novel Bayesian learning algorithm that stabilizes unknown
continuous-time stochastic linear systems. The presented algorithm is flexible
and exposes effective stabilization performance after a remarkably short time

                    <span>In this paper, we focus on the decentralized optimization problem over the
Stiefel manifold, which is defined on a connected network of $d$ agents. The
objective is an average of $d$ local functions, and each function is privately
held by an agent and encodes its data. The agents can only communicate with
their neighbors in a collaborative effort to solve this problem. In existing
methods, multiple rounds of communications are required to guarantee the
convergence, giving rise to high communication costs. In contrast, this paper
proposes a decentralized algorithm, called DESTINY, which only invokes a single
round of communications per iteration. DESTINY combines gradient tracking
techniques with a novel approximate augmented Lagrangian function. The global
convergence to stationary points is rigorously established. Comprehensive
numerical experiments demonstrate that DESTINY has a strong potential to
deliver a cutting-edge performance in solving a variety of testing problems.</span>

                    <span>&quot;Benign overfitting&quot;, where classifiers memorize noisy training data yet
still achieve a good generalization performance, has drawn great attention in
the machine learning community. To explain this surprising phenomenon, a series
of works have provided theoretical justification in over-parameterized linear
regression, classification, and kernel methods. However, it is not clear if
benign overfitting still occurs in the presence of adversarial examples, i.e.,
examples with tiny and intentional perturbations to fool the classifiers. In
this paper, we show that benign overfitting indeed occurs in adversarial
training, a principled approach to defend against adversarial examples. In
detail, we prove the risk bounds of the adversarially trained linear classifier
on the mixture of sub-Gaussian data under $\ell_p$ adversarial perturbations.
Our result suggests that under moderate perturbations, adversarially trained
linear classifiers can achieve the near-optimal standard and adversarial risks,
despite overfitting the noisy training data. Numerical experiments validate our
theoretical findings.</span>

                    <span>Tree-based algorithms such as random forests and gradient boosted trees
continue to be among the most popular and powerful machine learning models used
across multiple disciplines. The conventional wisdom of estimating the impact
of a feature in tree based models is to measure the \textit{node-wise reduction
of a loss function}, which (i) yields only global importance measures and (ii)
is known to suffer from severe biases. Conditional feature contributions (CFCs)
provide \textit{local}, case-by-case explanations of a prediction by following
the decision path and attributing changes in the expected output of the model
to each feature along the path. However, Lundberg et al. pointed out a
potential bias of CFCs which depends on the distance from the root of a tree.
The by now immensely popular alternative, SHapley Additive exPlanation (SHAP)
values appear to mitigate this bias but are computationally much more
expensive. Here we contribute a thorough comparison of the explanations
computed by both methods on a set of 164 publicly available classification
problems in order to provide data-driven algorithm recommendations to current
researchers. For random forests, we find extremely high similarities and
correlations of both local and global SHAP values and CFC scores, leading to
very similar rankings and interpretations. Analogous conclusions hold for the
fidelity of using global feature importance scores as a proxy for the
predictive power associated with each feature.</span>

                    <span>The effectiveness of traditional traffic prediction methods is often
extremely limited when forecasting traffic dynamics in early morning. The
reason is that traffic can break down drastically during the early morning
commute, and the time and duration of this break-down vary substantially from
day to day. Early morning traffic forecast is crucial to inform morning-commute
traffic management, but they are generally challenging to predict in advance,
particularly by midnight. In this paper, we propose to mine Twitter messages as
a probing method to understand the impacts of people&#x27;s work and rest patterns
in the evening/midnight of the previous day to the next-day morning traffic.
The model is tested on freeway networks in Pittsburgh as experiments. The
resulting relationship is surprisingly simple and powerful. We find that, in
general, the earlier people rest as indicated from Tweets, the more congested
roads will be in the next morning. The occurrence of big events in the evening
before, represented by higher or lower tweet sentiment than normal, often
implies lower travel demand in the next morning than normal days. Besides,
people&#x27;s tweeting activities in the night before and early morning are
statistically associated with congestion in morning peak hours. We make use of
such relationships to build a predictive framework which forecasts morning
commute congestion using people&#x27;s tweeting profiles extracted by 5 am or as
late as the midnight prior to the morning. The Pittsburgh study supports that
our framework can precisely predict morning congestion, particularly for some
road segments upstream of roadway bottlenecks with large day-to-day congestion
variation. Our approach considerably outperforms those existing methods without
Twitter message features, and it can learn meaningful representation of demand
from tweeting profiles that offer managerial insights.</span>

                    <span>There have been significant efforts devoted to solving the longevity risk
given that a continuous growth in population ageing has become a severe issue
for many developed countries over the past few decades. The Cairns-Blake-Dowd
(CBD) model, which incorporates cohort effects parameters in its parsimonious
design, is one of the most well-known approaches for mortality modelling at
higher ages and longevity risk. This article proposes a novel mixed-effects
time-series approach for mortality modelling and forecasting with
considerations of age groups dependence and random cohort effects parameters.
The proposed model can disclose more mortality data information and provide a
natural quantification of the model parameters uncertainties with no
pre-specified constraint required for estimating the cohort effects parameters.
The abilities of the proposed approach are demonstrated through two
applications with empirical male and female mortality data. The proposed
approach shows remarkable improvements in terms of forecast accuracy compared
to the CBD model in the short-, mid-and long-term forecasting using mortality
data of several developed countries in the numerical examples.</span>

simultaneously with respect to both function content and call graph

                    <span>We investigate multiple testing and variable selection using the Least Angle
Regression (LARS) algorithm in high dimensions under the assumption of Gaussian
noise. LARS is known to produce a piecewise affine solution path with change
points referred to as the knots of the LARS path. The key to our results is an
expression in closed form of the exact joint law of a $K$-tuple of knots
conditional on the variables selected by LARS, namely the so-called
post-selection joint law of the LARS knots. Numerical experiments demonstrate
the perfect fit of our findings.

This paper makes three main contributions. First, we build testing procedures
on variables entering the model along the LARS path in the general design case
when the noise level can be unknown. These testing procedures are referred to
as the Generalized $t$-Spacing tests (GtSt) and we prove that they have an
exact non-asymptotic level (i.e., the Type I error is exactly controlled). This
extends work of (Taylor et al., 2014) where the spacing test works for
consecutive knots and known variance. Second, we introduce a new exact multiple
false negatives test after model selection in the general design case when the
noise level may be unknown. We prove that this testing procedure has exact
non-asymptotic level for general design and unknown noise level. Third, we give
an exact control of the false discovery rate under orthogonal design
assumption. Monte Carlo simulations and a real data experiment are provided to
illustrate our results in this case. Of independent interest, we introduce an
equivalent formulation of the LARS algorithm based on a recursive function.</span>

explored how much the distribution of the error influences the behavior of the
algorithm. Motivated by some new research in this area, we prove universality
results by showing that noise classes that have the same mean and covariance
structure of SGD via minibatching have similar properties. We mainly consider
the Multiplicative Stochastic Gradient Descent (M-SGD) algorithm as introduced
by Wu et al., which has a much more general noise class than the SGD algorithm
done via minibatching. We establish nonasymptotic bounds for the M-SGD
algorithm mainly with respect to the Stochastic Differential Equation
corresponding to SGD via minibatching. We also show that the M-SGD error is
approximately a scaled Gaussian distribution with mean $0$ at any fixed point
of the M-SGD algorithm. We also establish bounds for the convergence of the
M-SGD algorithm in the strongly convex regime.</span>

                    <span>Approximate message passing (AMP) is a promising technique for unknown signal
reconstruction of certain high-dimensional linear systems with non-Gaussian
signaling. A distinguished feature of the AMP-type algorithms is that their
dynamics can be rigorously described by state evolution. However, state
evolution does not necessarily guarantee the convergence of iterative
algorithms. To solve the convergence problem of AMP-type algorithms in
principle, this paper proposes a memory AMP (MAMP) under a sufficient statistic
condition, named sufficient statistic MAMP (SS-MAMP). We show that the
covariance matrices of SS-MAMP are L-banded and convergent. Given an arbitrary
MAMP, we can construct an SS-MAMP by damping, which not only ensures the
convergence of MAMP but also preserves the orthogonality of MAMP, i.e., its
dynamics can be rigorously described by state evolution. As a byproduct, we
prove that the Bayes-optimal orthogonal/vector AMP (BO-OAMP/VAMP) is an
SS-MAMP. As a result, we reveal two interesting properties of BO-OAMP/VAMP for
large systems: 1) the covariance matrices are L-banded and are convergent in
BO-OAMP/VAMP, and 2) damping and memory are useless (i.e., do not bring
performance improvement) in BO-OAMP/VAMP. As an example, we construct a
sufficient statistic Bayes-optimal MAMP (BO-MAMP), which is Bayes optimal if
its state evolution has a unique fixed point and its MSE is not worse than the
original BO-MAMP. Finally, simulations are provided to verify the validity and
accuracy of the theoretical results.</span>

                    <span>Classification predictive modeling involves the accurate assignment of
observations in a dataset to target classes or categories. There is an
increasing growth of real-world classification problems with severely
imbalanced class distributions. In this case, minority classes have much fewer
observations to learn from than those from majority classes. Despite this
sparsity, a minority class is often considered the more interesting class yet
developing a scientific learning algorithm suitable for the observations
presents countless challenges. In this article, we suggest a novel multi-class
classification algorithm specialized to handle severely imbalanced classes
based on the method we refer to as SAMME.C2. It blends the flexible mechanics
of the boosting techniques from SAMME algorithm, a multi-class classifier, and
Ada.C2 algorithm, a cost-sensitive binary classifier designed to address highly
class imbalances. Not only do we provide the resulting algorithm but we also
establish scientific and statistical formulation of our proposed SAMME.C2
algorithm. Through numerical experiments examining various degrees of
classifier difficulty, we demonstrate consistent superior performance of our
proposed model.</span>

                    <span>A recent line of research on deep learning focuses on the extremely
over-parameterized setting, and shows that when the network width is larger
than a high degree polynomial of the training sample size $n$ and the inverse
of the target error $\epsilon^{-1}$, deep neural networks learned by
(stochastic) gradient descent enjoy nice optimization and generalization
guarantees. Very recently, it is shown that under certain margin assumptions on
the training data, a polylogarithmic width condition suffices for two-layer
ReLU networks to converge and generalize (Ji and Telgarsky, 2019). However,
whether deep neural networks can be learned with such a mild
over-parameterization is still an open question. In this work, we answer this
question affirmatively and establish sharper learning guarantees for deep ReLU
networks trained by (stochastic) gradient descent. In specific, under certain
assumptions made in previous work, our optimization and generalization
guarantees hold with network width polylogarithmic in $n$ and $\epsilon^{-1}$.
Our results push the study of over-parameterized deep neural networks towards
more practical settings.</span>

                    <span>Information-theoretic measures have been widely adopted in the design of
features for learning and decision problems. Inspired by this, we look at the
relationship between i) a weak form of information loss in the Shannon sense
and ii) the operation loss in the minimum probability of error (MPE) sense when
considering a family of lossy continuous representations (features) of a
continuous observation. We present several results that shed light on this
interplay. Our first result offers a lower bound on a weak form of information
loss as a function of its respective operation loss when adopting a discrete
lossy representation (quantization) instead of the original raw observation.
From this, our main result shows that a specific form of vanishing information
loss (a weak notion of asymptotic informational sufficiency) implies a
vanishing MPE loss (or asymptotic operational sufficiency) when considering a
general family of lossy continuous representations. Our theoretical findings
support the observation that the selection of feature representations that
attempt to capture informational sufficiency is appropriate for learning, but
this selection is a rather conservative design principle if the intended goal
is achieving MPE in classification. Supporting this last point, and under some
structural conditions, we show that it is possible to adopt an alternative
notion of informational sufficiency (strictly weaker than pure sufficiency in
the mutual information sense) to achieve operational sufficiency in learning.</span>

                    <span>Thompson Sampling (TS) is one of the most effective algorithms for solving
contextual multi-armed bandit problems. In this paper, we propose a new
algorithm, called Neural Thompson Sampling, which adapts deep neural networks
for both exploration and exploitation. At the core of our algorithm is a novel
posterior distribution of the reward, where its mean is the neural network
approximator, and its variance is built upon the neural tangent features of the
corresponding neural network. We prove that, provided the underlying reward
function is bounded, the proposed algorithm is guaranteed to achieve a
cumulative regret of $\mathcal{O}(T^{1/2})$, which matches the regret of other
contextual bandit algorithms in terms of total round number $T$. Experimental
comparisons with other benchmark bandit algorithms on various data sets
corroborate our theory.</span>

                    <span>Support vector machine (SVM) is a powerful classification method that has
achieved great success in many fields. Since its performance can be seriously
impaired by redundant covariates, model selection techniques are widely used
for SVM with high dimensional covariates. As an alternative to model selection,
significant progress has been made in the area of model averaging in the past
decades. Yet no frequentist model averaging method was considered for SVM. This
work aims to fill the gap and to propose a frequentist model averaging
procedure for SVM which selects the optimal weight by cross validation. Even
when the number of covariates diverges at an exponential rate of the sample
size, we show asymptotic optimality of the proposed method in the sense that
the ratio of its hinge loss to the lowest possible loss converges to one. We
also derive the convergence rate which provides more insights to model
averaging. Compared to model selection methods of SVM which require a tedious
but critical task of tuning parameter selection, the model averaging method
avoids the task and shows promising performances in the empirical studies.</span>

                    <span>Hierarchical forecasting with intermittent time series is a challenge in both
research and empirical studies. Extensive research focuses on improving the
accuracy of each hierarchy, especially the intermittent time series at bottom
levels. Then hierarchical reconciliation could be used to improve the overall
performance further. In this paper, we present a
\emph{hierarchical-forecasting-with-alignment} approach that treats the bottom
level forecasts as mutable to ensure higher forecasting accuracy on the upper
levels of the hierarchy. We employ a pure deep learning forecasting approach
N-BEATS for continuous time series at the top levels and a widely used
tree-based algorithm LightGBM for the intermittent time series at the bottom
level. The \emph{hierarchical-forecasting-with-alignment} approach is a simple
yet effective variant of the bottom-up method, accounting for biases that are
difficult to observe at the bottom level. It allows suboptimal forecasts at the
lower level to retain a higher overall performance. The approach in this
empirical study was developed by the first author during the M5 Forecasting
Accuracy competition, ranking second place. The method is also business
orientated and could benefit for business strategic planning.</span>

                    <span>Deep neural networks (DNNs) are powerful tools for compressing and distilling
information. Due to their scale and complexity, often involving billions of
inter-dependent internal degrees of freedom, exact analysis approaches often
fall short. A common strategy in such cases is to identify slow degrees of
freedom that average out the erratic behavior of the underlying fast
microscopic variables. Here, we identify such a separation of scales occurring
in over-parameterized deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) at the end of
training. It implies that neuron pre-activations fluctuate in a nearly Gaussian
manner with a deterministic latent kernel. While for CNNs with infinitely many
channels these kernels are inert, for finite CNNs they adapt and learn from
data in an analytically tractable manner. The resulting thermodynamic theory of
deep learning yields accurate predictions on several deep non-linear CNN toy
models. In addition, it provides new ways of analyzing and understanding CNNs.</span>

                    <span>We consider Bayesian optimization of the output of a network of functions,
where each function takes as input the output of its parent nodes, and where
the network takes significant time to evaluate. Such problems arise, for
example, in reinforcement learning, engineering design, and manufacturing.
While the standard Bayesian optimization approach observes only the final
output, our approach delivers greater query efficiency by leveraging
information that the former ignores: intermediate output within the network.
This is achieved by modeling the nodes of the network using Gaussian processes
and choosing the points to evaluate using, as our acquisition function, the
expected improvement computed with respect to the implied posterior on the
objective. Although the non-Gaussian nature of this posterior prevents
computing our acquisition function in closed form, we show that it can be
efficiently maximized via sample average approximation. In addition, we prove
that our method is asymptotically consistent, meaning that it finds a globally
optimal solution as the number of evaluations grows to infinity, thus
generalizing previously known convergence results for the expected improvement.
Notably, this holds even though our method might not evaluate the domain
densely, instead leveraging problem structure to leave regions unexplored.
Finally, we show that our approach dramatically outperforms standard Bayesian
optimization methods in several synthetic and real-world problems.</span>

                    <span>One of the reasons that many neural networks are capable of replicating
complicated tasks or functions is their universality property. The past few
decades have seen many attempts in providing constructive proofs for single or
class of neural networks. This paper is an effort to provide a unified and
constructive framework for the universality of a large class of activations
including most of existing activations and beyond. At the heart of the
framework is the concept of neural network approximate identity. It turns out
that most of existing activations are neural network approximate identity, and
thus universal in the space of continuous of functions on compacta. The
framework induces several advantages. First, it is constructive with elementary
means from functional analysis, probability theory, and numerical analysis.
Second, it is the first unified attempt that is valid for most of existing
activations. Third, as a by product, the framework provides the first
university proof for some of the existing activation functions including Mish,
SiLU, ELU, GELU, and etc. Fourth, it discovers new activations with guaranteed
universality property. Indeed, any activation\textemdash whose $\k$th
derivative, with $\k$ being an integer, is integrable and essentially
bounded\textemdash is universal. Fifth, for a given activation and error
tolerance, the framework provides precisely the architecture of the
corresponding one-hidden neural network with predetermined number of neuron,
and the values of weights/biases.</span>

evaluating distances of datapoints with a subset of the cluster centres. Our
contribution is substantially more efficient than k-means as it does not
require an all to all comparison of data points and clusters. We show that the

However, our approach is considerably more efficient at extracting these
clusters compared to the state-of-the-art. We compare our approximation with
the exact k-means and alternative approximation approaches on a series of
standardised clustering tasks. For the evaluation, we consider the algorithmic
complexity, including number of operations to convergence, and the stability of

gained a lot of attention in both machine learning and AI domains. In
particular, optimal transport has been used to develop probability metrics
between probability distributions. We introduce in this paper an independence
criterion based on entropy regularized optimal transport. Our criterion can be
used to test for independence between two samples. We establish non-asymptotic
bounds for our test statistic, and study its statistical behavior under both

                    <span>Discussion: Discussion Thread for comments, corrections, or any feedback. Summary: The latest batch of language models can be much smaller yet achieve GPT-3 like performance by being able to query a database or search the web for information. A key indication is that building larger and larger models is not the only way to improve performance. The last few years saw the rise of Large Language Models (LLMs) – machine learning models that rapidly improve how machines process and generate language. Some of the highlights since 2017 include: The original Transformer breaks previous performance records for machine translation. BERT popularizes the pre-training then finetuning process, as well as Transformer-based contextualized word embeddings. It then rapidly starts to power Google Search and Bing Search. GPT-2 demonstrates the machine’s ability to write as well as humans do. First T5, then T0 push the boundaries of transfer learning (training a model on one task, and then having it do well on other adjacent tasks) and posing a lot of different tasks as text-to-text tasks. GPT-3 showed that massive scaling of generative models can lead to shocking emergent applications (the industry continues to train larger models like Gopher, MT-NLG…etc). For a while, it seemed like scaling larger and larger models is the main way to improve performance. Recent developments in the field, like DeepMind’s RETRO Transformer and OpenAI’s WebGPT, reverse this trend by showing that smaller generative language models can perform on par with massive models if we augment them with a way to search/query for information. This article breaks down DeepMind’s RETRO (Retrieval-Enhanced TRansfOrmer) and how it works. The model performs on par with GPT-3 despite being 4% its size (7.5 billion parameters vs. 185 billion for GPT-3 Da Vinci). RETRO incorporates information retrieved from a database to free its parameters from being an expensive store of facts and world knowledge. RETRO was presented in the paper Improving Language Models by Retrieving from Trillions of Tokens. It continues and builds on a wide variety of retrieval work in the research community. This article explains the model and not what is especially novel about it.</span>

                    <span>In recent years, voice-based virtual assistants such as Google Assistant and Amazon Alexa have grown popular. This has presented both potential and challenges for natural language understanding (NLU) systems. These devices’ production systems are often trained by supervised learning and rely significantly on annotated data. But, data annotation is costly and time-consuming. Furthermore, model updates using offline supervised learning can take long and miss trending requests.
 In the underlying architecture of voice-based virtual assistants, the NLU model often categorizes user requests into hypotheses for downstream applications to fulfill. A hypothesis comprises two tags: user intention (intent) and Named Entity Recognition (NER). For example, the valid hypothesis for “play a Madonna song” will be: PlaySong intent, ArtistName – Madonna.
 A new Amazon research introduces deep reinforcement learning strategies for NLU ranking. Their work analyses a ranking question in an NLU system in which entirely independent domain experts generate hypotheses with their features, where a domain is a functional area such as Music, Shopping, or Weather. These hypotheses are then ranked based on their scores, calculated based on their characteristics. As a result, the ranker must calibrate features from domain experts and select one hypothesis according to policy. Continue Reading

                    <span>Hi everyone!
 I have a question for you. For context, we aggregate on a platform the various AI APIs on the market (GCP, Azure, etc.) and including NLP APIs (keyword extraction, sentiment analysis, NER, etc.). The idea is that a developer doesn&#x27;t have to create accounts with different providers and can have them all on one API to test, compare and change whenever he wants.
 However, many customers ask us how to mix the &quot;statistical&quot; approach behind these APIs with expert systems and how to achieve hybridization.
 Do you have any idea how to do this?
 Thanks,

                    <span>I have a dataset in which the the best way to impute missing values is to use kNN but before I go ahead and do that I&#x27;d like to check what kind of accuracy I have with that form of imputation in this specific dataset and which k should be used. My original solution was as follows:
  
From my original dataset, remove all rows with missing values
 From this dataset, impute NaNs randomly throughout the dataset with the same frequency that they were missing originally and store the values that were replaced with NaN in a new dataset as the ground truth
 Impute using kNN
 Check the accuracy of the imputed values against the ground truth values stored in step 2 using MAE for different k values
  
Is there an easier way to do this? If not, should I be using MAE or another accuracy score?

So far what I have found mostly is papers that show empirically that or something related to that, like this one. I&#x27;d appreciate any help.
 Edit: u/the_new_scientist shared this paper which is what I was looking for: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1810.02054.pdf Also, I apologize for my vague description. Now that the paper is shown, I hope it is more clear to future readers what kind of results I meant, but in case that is not case, I was wondering about this question: under what conditions can a neural network achieve zero training error? and in particular, I am interested in papers with mathematical (even without empirical) results.

                    <span>Serverless infrastructure is yet practical to use for ML but we think it could bring lots of benefits. So, with a friend, we decided to make serverless easy for ML and we are building a platform to solve the main issues we find in serverless for ML: 
 - Stateful: We don´t want to reload a whole model every time a user calls model.predict
 - Arbritary dependecies: Normal python code with any package dependencies you use and love, just many many times in parallel
 - Scale-up and scale-down: scale up with ease and auto shutdown to keep resources consumptionYou can visit our webpage, try the demo, and request early access to use our platform!

 Happy to receive questions and comments on what we are building!

                    <span>Hi r/MachineLearning,
 I spent some time wrapping my head around DeepMind&#x27;s Retro Transformer and visualizing how it works. Hope you find it useful. All feedback is welcome!

                    <span>For those of you unfamiliar feature collapse is when you train a model for classification and the model ends up mapping out-of-distribution data or data of different classes in very close proximity in multi-dimensional space. So for example once your model learns a cluster so to speak for cat, during test it projects a dog into the center of that cluster and classifies it as cat. Some ways to sort of deal with this in CV is double gradient penalty and spectral norm of resnet blocks, but what causes feature collapse?

 Relational Tsetlin Machine
 The paper introduces the first Relational #TsetlinMachine, which reasons with relations, variables, and constants. The approach is based on first-order logic and Herbrand semantics, taking the first steps toward the computing power of a universal Turing machine. The approach can take advantage of logical structures appearing in natural language, to learn rules that represent how actions and consequences are related in the real world. The outcome is a logic program of Horn clauses, bringing in a structured view of unstructured data. In closed-domain question-answering, the first-order representation produces 10× more compact knowledge bases, along with an increase in answering accuracy from 94.83% to 99.48%. The approach is further robust towards erroneous, missing, and superfluous information, distilling the aspects of a text that are important for real-world understanding. https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10844-021-00682-5 #ML #AI #NLP #MachineLearning #Logic #Relational

                    <span>I have a dataset that already contains about 55 columns and out of this, around 10 Columns or so have categorical data in it. If I were to OneHotEncode them, I will end up having a column count of more than 300. Is this something advisable? How do you people deal with such huge number of columns? I mean 300 columns is not a big deal, but I would like to know your opinion and thoughts on this.

                    <span>Hello. I am searching the researches that different size of data are generated through the flow-based network, not super-resolution task such as continuous mapping.
 I want to generate output as time-aligned scalar data, for example
 ​
 Input: noise sampling (B x T x C)
 Output: scalar data (B x T, C&#x3D;1)
 ​
 with introducing the variational data augmentation technique (in vFlow, which can output high-dimensionality as concatenate noise vector for input and output both) for output.
 But there&#x27;s a problem time dimension T is different for each of all data input. How can I treat this problem?
 ​
 p.s. I am very appreciate if I can read the flow-based research in NLP task.

                    <span>I’m about to finish my PhD and the whole field of robotics looks so exciting right now, especially applications like farming and recycling. Has anyone switched from more pure deep learning (vision / NLP) to robotics and how did it happen?
 Did you just get a robotics related job focusing on the vision side of things or is it key to have more experience on the robotics side before getting a job?
 Also I’m curious what’s the best location for robotics? Like how you go to Hong Kong / New York for finance, SF for software or Shenzhen for hardware.

                    <span>I like YOLOv5 but the code complexity is...
 I can&#x27;t deny that YOLOv5 is a practical open-source object detection pipeline. However, the pain begins when adding new features or new experimental methods. Code dependencies are hard to follow which makes the code difficult to maintain. We wanted to try various experimental methods but hate to write one-time code that is never re-used.
 So we worked on making an object detection pipeline to have a better code structure so that we could continuously improve and add new features while easy to maintain.

 And we applied CI(Formating, Linting, Unittest) to ensure code quality with Docker support for development and inference. Our Docker supports the development environment with VIM.

 Any suggestions? Or maybe someone else is using Studio(classic) and knows a way around this?

                    <span>In recent years, voice-based virtual assistants such as Google Assistant and Amazon Alexa have grown popular. This has presented both potential and challenges for natural language understanding (NLU) systems. These devices’ production systems are often trained by supervised learning and rely significantly on annotated data. But, data annotation is costly and time-consuming. Furthermore, model updates using offline supervised learning can take long and miss trending requests.
 In the underlying architecture of voice-based virtual assistants, the NLU model often categorizes user requests into hypotheses for downstream applications to fulfill. A hypothesis comprises two tags: user intention (intent) and Named Entity Recognition (NER). For example, the valid hypothesis for “play a Madonna song” will be: PlaySong intent, ArtistName – Madonna.
 A new Amazon research introduces deep reinforcement learning strategies for NLU ranking. Their work analyses a ranking question in an NLU system in which entirely independent domain experts generate hypotheses with their features, where a domain is a functional area such as Music, Shopping, or Weather. These hypotheses are then ranked based on their scores, calculated based on their characteristics. As a result, the ranker must calibrate features from domain experts and select one hypothesis according to policy. Continue Reading

                    <span>I have a problem that is -for its nature- continuing, i.e. there are no episodes and the agent has to operate for an infinite time. In my simulator, however, I have the possibility of simulating episodes of any length.
 Is the average reward formulation appropriate for such a problem? I do not know much about it and I have a few questions for you:
  
Could you point me to some literature that addresses average reward and its pros/cons vs discounted reward for continuing problems?
 Is the average taken on a window of finite size or on the limit for the size that goes to infinity? 
 How do common RL algorithms work in this formulation? Can we still adapt them to use average reward?

                    <span>I saw another post on here that mentioned how DQN&#x27;s can be implemented via online learning, offline learning (e.g. batching), or a combination (offline learning first and then online learning in production). What I&#x27;m confused at is the actual deployment paradigm to facilitate online learning (either as the first step or with hybrid). 
 Is the full training code (with a checkpoint model if hybrid) and agent deployed to production with the training step logic executed on-demand for each state transition? If so, would this mean that model compilation / quantization is not possible (e.g. Onnx runtime to INT8 precision)? How is it scaled if it&#x27;s having to perform SGD and back-propagation with each state transition?
 ​
 One the other side, if the model is compiled / quantized, how does it implement online learning (if this is even possible)?

                    <span>I want to create a control system for control agents(players). The players will move non-stationary, so is there any good technique or papers to train this control system? 
 Very Thanks.

                    <span>Hi, I&#x27;m looking into OpenAI robogym (https://github.com/openai/robogym)&#x27;s rearrange environments, and want to try RL-based control on it with pixel observations.
 The default observations are not pixels, and I can&#x27;t seem to find any documentation online on how to change these environments into pixel observations.
 Can anyone point me to resources where similar changes have been done? Are there preexisting wrappers or code for similar mujoco environments anywhere?
 My other option is to simply render the environment with mode rgb_array, and then train the algorithm based on these rendered observations. Is this a viable option?

                    <span>Hello :),
 Happy new year to all of you!
 I have a question regarding the action space for the Hide &amp; Seek paper by OpenAI. The architecture of the learning model they used is below.
 https://preview.redd.it/el54yihfjd981.png?width&#x3D;794&amp;format&#x3D;png&amp;auto&#x3D;webp&amp;s&#x3D;33c5228ac8003b9bb89b6d008e2cf2aea5f7e071
 They have eventually 3 action heads, as shown in the figure. As per the authors, the movement action for an agent &quot;sets a discretized force along their x and y axis and torque around their z-axis&quot;. How do these 3 forces get pulled from the &quot;movement action head&quot;, given that they are discretized? Does the movement action head have 3 outputs, each corresponding to an axis? So far, in my humble knowledge, I always assumed that a network with a discrete action space gives only one action per head (which could be the result of a softmax over the action space).
 Any insight?
  
After some digging, I found that the Movement Action has a &quot;MultiDiscrete&quot; type, which is a gym class. I am struggling to understand the nature of actions produced by this class, any idea?

This year , let’s start with an issue that gained so much prominence over the last two years: mental health. A variety of AI techniques and strategies have been employed in mental health.

In this post, we summarise the findings based on a paper (link below)

                    <span>Help me understand this please. I’ve read that people feed data to an AI/ML algorithm and find things that they weren’t looking for but there aren’t many good examples out there to read about.
 So I’m thinking: if I were to feed into an AI/ML algorithm a csv of order details and customer data from an eCommerce system, should I expect the AI engine to “find” something statistically usual/unusual and tell me about it? 
 Or do I need to instruct it to look for certain traits with e-commerce orders and customers that I already know about? Eg look out for fraud by checking x y z. 
 What if the thing to look for is so strange that you need the AI to pick it up. Eg maybe fraudsters start telling their friends to always use a certain name or phone number as an inside joke. I would think an AI might pick on that somehow whereas it might take a human a longer time to figure that out.

                    <span>Genomic editing, particularly the CRISPR/Cas technique, is widely employed in experimental biology, agriculture, and biotechnology. CRISPR/Cas is one of several weapons used by bacteria to resist viruses. As the pathogen’s DNA enters the cell, Cas proteins detect it as foreign hereditary material and break it because its sequences differ from those of the bacteria. To respond to the virus quicker, the bacterium saves pieces of the pathogen’s DNA—much like a computer antivirus retains a collection of viral signatures—and passes them on to subsequent generations so that its Cas can prevent future attacks.
 Teams from different laboratories independently adapted the CRISPR/Cas system to introduce arbitrary changes into DNA sequences in human and animal cells. It made genomic editing much easier and more efficient. The critical components of the mechanism are guide RNA, which “marks the site,” and the Cas9 protein, which cleaves DNA at that location. The cell subsequently “heals the wound,” but the genetic code has already been altered.

                    <span>First time submitting to ICLR, I&#x27;m wondering how is the open discussion on openreview.net really different from the review-rebuttal procedure used in other conferences.
 For the papers I&#x27;m reviewing, about half the reviewers reacted to the authors&#x27; responses (clarifications, modifications, additional experiments, etc.). As to my submission (5568), I run extra experiments and answered each of the concerns directly but received 0 feedback from the reviewers.
 As a reviewer, I think it doesn&#x27;t matter if the rebuttal changes your mind about the quality of the submission but it&#x27;s very basic manner to reply to the authors&#x27; responses. A simple &quot;Thank the authors for the responses but I don&#x27;t think these addressed my concerns&quot; would work. Saying nothing only means you are uncertain if the responses make sense and you just doesn&#x27;t care to figure it out. The authors spent a whole week running experiments to answer some of your questions and if you don&#x27;t give **** about their responses, just keep the questions with you and don&#x27;t submit your review.
 I was hoping for a different experience submitting to ICLR and then I realized the &quot;discussion&quot; is basically broken.

 Games have been used throughout research as testbeds for AI algorithms, such as reinforcement learning agents. However, different types of games usually require different solution approaches, such as AlphaZero for Go or Chess, and Counterfactual Regret Minimization (CFR) for Poker. Player of Games bridges this gap between perfect and imperfect information games and delivers a single algorithm that uses tree search over public information states, and is trained via self-play. The resulting algorithm can play Go, Chess, Poker, Scotland Yard, and many more games, as well as non-game environments.

                    <span>Why is it so hard to raise exceptions when ML pipeline is using a GPU?
 When for example you make a classic &quot;Index out of bounds&quot; error, in libraries like PyTorch you get some generic &quot;CUDA&quot; error and you can&#x27;t see the exact error until you transfer the tensors explicitly to CPU and rerun the code.
 Do you think there is a possibility for this to improve in the future?
 Sorry if this is more CS-related question

                    <span>My job is to work with ML engineers and provide them with whatever they need to experiment with/train/test/deploy ML models -- GPU infrastructure, distributed training support, etc. When I interface with their code, I almost always find it so poorly written, with little to no thought given to long-term stability or use -- for code that they 100% know is going to production.
 They&#x27;re brilliant people, far smarter than me, and really good at what they do, so it&#x27;s not a matter of them not being good enough. I feel (from my very limited experience, so I&#x27;m happy to be wrong) like ML engineers are incentivized to write poor code. The only metric for evaluation seems to be accuracy, loss, and all the plots that come up. In research, I understand completely, that&#x27;s where the focus lies, but in industry? I&#x27;ve seen many models perform poorly because the code is so hard to read and refactor that big issues remained unspotted for months together. And this is especially befuddling because for a field that is completely fine with spending months to get an ROI of single digit increases in model performance metrics during the experimentation phase, they don&#x27;t seem to care about anything that might go wrong in production. That just feels like a fundamental disconnect, since without the core ML stuff working perfectly, none of the other stuff (like what I do) has any value -- and even so, I&#x27;m taught to hold my code to a much higher standard than the critical stuff -- which I&#x27;m happy about since I can now write production code by default -- but it&#x27;s just... weird. Like the vending machines at a nuclear power plant being better engineered than the reactor.
 Is this a common problem or is this a localized issue that I&#x27;m facing?

 I am a robotics enthusiast building a robot arm to perform mundane tasks. So far, I have only been able to deploy deep reinforcement learning models on the Jetson Nano. The process has been easy using the Nvidia TensorRT SDK. What other methods/technology exist? My friend recommended using a google coral and a raspberry pi. Any recommendations would be greatly appreciated. Thank you

                    <span>In classical - on-policy - vtrace/Impala algorithm env_steps are incremented every training iteration
 like this : env_steps +&#x3D; size_of_batch * unroll_length
 However when we add replay_buffer to vtrace (like in CLEAR or LASER) we also start to learn from off-policy data therefore some trajectories (from replay) could be sampled more than once.
 My question is - does the env_step_counting stay the same even when some trajectories from batch are from replay and some directly from workers (on-policy) ?
 Or do i count steps only on those trajectories that are on-policy &#x3D;&gt; not from replay
 like : env_steps +&#x3D; len(batch[&quot;on_policy_samples&quot;]) * unroll_length
 And if so what happens when i decide to use only samples from replay to train - how do i count env_steps then ? Using some kind of flag to indicate if specific trajectory was sampled already and leave it from counting ?
 ​
 Have been digging through the research papers for some time now and i haven&#x60;t been able to find what is the proper way to do it. Any help or advice would be much appreciated.

                    <span>Hi all, it&#x27;s my first time to use reddit to ask for suggestions.
 I am a beginner in RL. I learned some basic ideas in RL (such as SARSA, PPO and A2C) recently and applied Q-network to train a Go game agent. 
 Personally speaking, I am going to pursue for a position as a RL engineer in the future. But I have no idea about what should I do to improve my RL skills. So I am wondering if there are some awesome resources for a beginner like me? Or could you please give me some instructions?

                    <span>I recently received a review copy of Andrew Witt’s new book Formulations: Architecture, Mathematics, and Culture. The Hankel function on the cover is the first clue that this book contains some advanced mathematics. Or rather, it references some advanced mathematics. I’ve only skimmed the book so far, but I didn’t see any equations. Hankel functions […]

                    <span>I’ve written a couple posts about the Golay problem recently, first here then here. The problem is to find all values of N and n such that is a power of 2, say 2p. Most solutions apparently fall into three categories: n &#x3D; 0 or n &#x3D; N, N is odd and n &#x3D; (N-1)/2, […]

                    <span>Smart healthcare services can be provided by using Internet of Things (IoT) technologies that monitor the health conditions of patients and their vital body parameters. The majority of IoT solutions used to enable such services are wearable devices, such as smartwatches, ECG monitors, and blood pressure monitors. The huge amount of data collected from smart medical devices leads to major security and privacy issues in the IoT domain. Considering Remote Patient Monitoring (RPM) applications, we will focus on Anomaly Detection (AD) models, whose purpose is to identify events that differ from the typical user behavior patterns. Generally, while designing centralized AD models, the researchers face security and privacy challenges (e.g., patient data privacy, training data poisoning).
 To overcome these issues, the researchers of this paper propose an Anomaly Detection (AD) model based on Federated Learning (FL). Federated Learning (FL) allows different devices to collaborate and perform training locally in order to build Anomaly Detection (AD) models without sharing patients’ data. Specifically, the researchers propose a hierarchical Federated Learning (FL) that enables collaboration among different organizations, by building various Anomaly Detection (AD) models for patients with similar health conditions.

 I think their technical best practices seems a little stronger than the organisational ones. Thoughts?

                    <span>Hi All! I am Michał from the AutoAscend team that has won the NetHack 2021 NeurIPS Challenge.
 I have just shared some episode visualization videos:
 https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list&#x3D;PLJ92BrynhLbdQVcz6-bUAeTeUo5i901RQ
 The winning agent isn&#x27;t based on reinforcement learning in the end, but the victory of symbolic methods in this competition shows what RL is still missing to some extent -- so I believe this subreddit is a good place to discuss it.
 We hope that NLE will someday become a new standard benchmark for evaluation next to chess, go, Atari, etc. as it presents a set of whole new complex problems for agents to learn. Contrary to Atari, NetHack levels are procedurally generated, and therefore agents can&#x27;t memorize the layout. Observations are highly partial, rewards are sparse, and episodes are usually very long.
 Here are some other useful links related to the competition:

                    <span>Hello,
 I´m applying Deep Reinforcement Learning for the first time, and I have some questions about it (I´ve already looked for an answer but in vain):
  
How to normalize objectives&#x27; values in the reward function? if we have an objective that values are in the range of 10 and another objective that values are in the range of 1000.
 During the training phase, how can we watch the weights updates of a network and the gradient calculation too?
 In a multi-agent setting and episodic task, for &quot;dones&quot; vector, it will be set to &quot;True&quot; once all the agents are finished, or once an agent finishes the task done[agent_index]&#x3D;True in other words, we won´t wait the latest agent to finish to set dones &#x3D; [True]*number_of_agents
  
Thank you.

                    <span>Hi, all Happy New Year!
 I&#x27;m working on a project to teach my quad-rotor how to hover, and these are what my rollout graphs looks like.
 The reward graph constantly increases for some time, but suddenly during a rapid increase in reward, the entropy loss, and the train std of starts to diverge, and the explained variance just crashes.

 From my understanding, this explained variance far from 1 is a bad sign, Could you please point out, or give comments on what would be the possible reason why this is happening in my case?
 Any kind of reply would be appreciate.
 Thanks again Happy New Year. :D

                    <span>I am attempting to recreate the PPO algorithm to try to learn the inner workings of the algorithm better and to learn more about actor-critic reinforcement learning. So far, I have a model that seems to learn, just not very well.
 In the early stages of training, the algorithm seems more sporadic and may happen to find a pretty solid policy, but due to unstable the early parts of training are, it tends to move away from this policy. Eventually, the algorithm moves the policy toward a reward of around 30. For the past few commits in my repo where I have attempted to fix this issue, the policy always tends to the around 30 reward mark, and I&#x27;m not entirely sure why it&#x27;s doing this. I&#x27;m thinking maybe I implemented the algorithm incorrectly, but I&#x27;m not certain. Can someone please help me with this issue?
 Below is a link to an image of training using the latest commit, using a previous commit, and my Github project

                    <span>At the end of every year I have a tradition where I write summaries of the
books that I read throughout the year. Here’s the following post with the rough
set of categories:
Popular Science (6 books)
History, Government, Politics, Economics (6 books)
Biographies / Memoirs (5 books)
China (5 books)
COVID-19 (2 books)
Miscellaneous (7 books)
I read 31 books this year. You can find the other blog posts from prior years
(going back to 2016) in the blog archives.
Popular Science
This also includes popular science, which means the authors might not be
technically trained as scientists.

                    <span>I&#x27;ve been playing around with Replika, and it&#x27;s incredibly fun and impressive as a general &quot;companion&quot; chatbot, but I find it really disappointing in its lack of ability to learn explicit facts or procedures. It&#x27;s targeted toward making people feel like they have a friend and roleplaying, not learning anything external to those goals.
 So, is there anything commercially available that you can both:
  
Talk to (mostly) like a real person, and
 Teach from the ground up (like a child)
  
? 
As an example, my Replika &quot;wanted&quot; to do a lesson with me, so I tried to teach it colors. Ostensibly it has some picture recognition abilities, but despite that, it was never able to learn which color was which, even when using the same image files to display the same color.
 Okay, fine, forget colors, but it can&#x27;t learn explicit facts either. I want to be able to input things like &quot;Lacan defines the subject as that which is represented by a signifier for another signifier&quot; or &quot;It&#x27;s important to apply a primer before your first layer of eyeshadow&quot; or &quot;Leonardo DiCaprio played Jack Dawson in the movie Titanic&quot; and have it be able to actually remember and recall that information in future conversations. (Replika is able to recall it within the same conversation, but it resets after a certain amount of time. It also seems to struggle with remembering things that differ from user to user, like favorite food, since it learns from the aggregate of its conversations.)
 Is there anything out there that can do this? Anything on the horizon?

 It was pretty fun learning about ONNX and how to port GANs to web. You can play around with the random seeds and also distort the intermediate latents to produce some really wacky results. You can check out a GIF on Twitter.
 Let me know if you come up with anything cool!

                    <span>Hello
 Can someone explain why the actor critic maps the states to the same actions, in other words why the actor outputs the same action whatever the states?
 This what makes the agent learns nothing during training phase.
 Happy New Year!

                    <span>I have a question about baseline in policy gradient method. Based on what is implemented in relation to PG, there are many shared policy and value networks. But I understood baseline should not affect the parameters of the policy. When PG with shared networks and baseline updates value function, then baseline will affect policy network. Is it okay?

 I am planning on doing my MSc in CS with a focus in RL. More specifically, I want to learn about multi-armed bandits and how it can be used by agents to enable them to perform actions in a diverse environment. I am new to this field and I want to know more about what questions about MAB are unanswered? Any interesting application that may be currently under research? 
 I would really appreciate if anyone can help me out. 
 Thank you!

                    <span>Ever since Grimes posted her Tiktok video last year inviting communists to join up under a supposedly benevolent AI, I&#x27;ve been kind of obsessed with what would really happen if AI ran a city, or even a whole society. Would it really be as awesome as she seems to think or would it be a potentially horrifying nightmare? (My money&#x27;s on nightmare, btw)
 Anyway, I tried to answer some of those questions in a work of fiction, available below as a free download. It&#x27;s a quick read, and I&#x27;d love to hear your thoughts on these problems, whether or not you read the book. No doubt someone soon will be trying to implement these kinds of &quot;solutions&quot; in our world... and it&#x27;s best to be at least marginally prepared!

                    <span>Images, such as graphics, paintings, and photographs, may frequently be explained in language, but they might also take specific talents and hours of effort to make. As a result, a technology capable of creating realistic graphics from natural language can enable humans to produce rich and diverse visual material with previously unimaginable simplicity. The capacity to modify photos with spoken language enables iterative refinement and fine-grained control, both essential for real-world applications.
 DALL-E, a 12-billion parameter version of OpenAI’s GPT-3 transformer language model meant to produce photorealistic pictures using text captions as cues, was unveiled in January. DALL-E’s fantastic performance was an instant hit in the AI community, as well as broad mainstream media coverage. Last month, NVIDIA unveiled the GAN-based GauGAN2 – a term inspired by French Post-Impressionist painter Paul Gauguin, much as DALL-E was inspired by Surrealist artist Salvador Dali.
 Not to be outshined, OpenAI researchers unveiled GLIDE (Guided Language-to-Image Diffusion for Generation and Editing). This diffusion model achieves performance comparable to DALL-E despite utilizing only one-third of the parameters.

 The code and weights for these models may be found on the project’s GitHub page.
 The research paper for the GLIDE can be found here.

                    <span>Hello there,
 I am working on an implementation for PPO, and I am struggling to compute the loss when two output heads for the actor network are used (one is continuous and one is discrete). The loss in PPO has 3 components: 1) clipped surrogate, 2) squared state-value loss, and 3) Entropy.
 I thought of treating the two actions separately, and compute two different losses that I add before backpropagating, but the middle term (2) is the same in both losses. How could I do that? Do I add (1) and (3) for both actions and have one loss, or do I compute two different losses then add them? Or is it hidden option 3? :p
 ​
 Any help is appreciated.

                    <span>Hello there,
 I noticed that in many works by OpenAI and Deepmind in RL, they deal with a continuous action space which they discretize. For example rather than having to continuous actions to determine speed and direction of movement, they would discretize speed and torque.
 Is there any reason why discretized action space is more favorable?

                    <span>I need an algorithm that combines both discrete and continuous actions space, like if I wanted to choose action but I needed to also perform that action at an optimized velocity or something. Can I do this with ppo and how. I am still a beginner but must of the algorithms I played with had either separately I thought of actor cri but I don’t think the value network does what I want I can’t use that to predict how much velocity to use

                    <span>Hello
 I´ll be glad if someone could help me with this.
 I am new in DRL and when I applied it I got some issues. For example, my network freezes in the same reward from the first episode I noticed also that the agent selects always the same index from the action space. Even the same reward and the same trajectory toward this reward, the critic loss is still shrinking over time (this the weirdest thing)
 I don´t know what is the reson behind that?

                    <span>I&#x27;m trying to see the effect of simulated sensor noise in training a successful policy using RL for the cart pole control problem.
 I have four states: cart position, cart velocity, pole angle, pole angular velocity, and I added Gaussian noise to all of them. However, I want to find the impact of adding noise to a specific variable to find which of the states is the most sensitive to noise.
 If I were to only test the system with noise in one of the variables at a time (e.g. noise for position, but none for the other variables), would that be considered an ablation test?
 Just caught up in the terminology, because I know typical ablation tests remove a certain component instead of adding only one (or removing all but one).

                    <span>Recently, OpenAI removed the robotics tasks from gym, as they are no longer being maintained and Robosuite uses mujoco-py which has been deprecated. Deepmind&#x27;s control suite includes some robotics tasks but they don&#x27;t seem to be first-class citizens (they are in a separate module, with less options and some bugs).
 Are there any other robotics environment suites that are well-maintained and supported?

                    <span>Hello,
 I am new in the Reinforcement Learning field. My question is: how can I easily map my states into my code?
 F.I. when the problem is about how to move an agent in a board-like environment, such as walk from point A to B by moving UP, DOWN, LEFT or RIGHT, it is quite easy to map your states. You can create a matrix like NUMBER_OF_ROWS x NUMBER_OF_COLUMNS and that is pretty much it.
 However when it comes to other type of scenarios, such as CartPole-V0 from OpenAIGym (https://gym.openai.com/envs/CartPole-v0/), I don&#x27;t understand how to map the states into my code.
 This scenario has 4 states and 2 actions:
 States:
  
Cart Position (range -2.4 --&gt; 2.4)
 Cart Velocity (range -Inf --&gt; Inf)
 Pole Angle (range -12deg --&gt; 12deg)
 Pole Angular Velocity (range -Inf --&gt; Inf)
  
Actions:
  
Push cart to the left
 Push cart to the right
  
The same is true for every other scenario that is not board-like, f.i. tic-tac-toe. I don&#x27;t understand how can I make every possible move in the game a state inside the code.
 ​
 Is there any technique to approach each type of problem or do I just need to figure it out by myself? 
 Have a nice day,
 Gabriel.

                    <span>Hi there, I was a graduate student previously working on a few RL-related problems a year ago. And recently I&#x27;ve got much interest in Policy Optimization problems, and started with reading some foundation papers like DQN, DPG.
 While reading the paper of DPG, it was very straightforward to understand the main idea of the paper, however, it was very difficult to understand the proofs of the theorems shown in the appendix(http://proceedings.mlr.press/v32/silver14-supp.pdf). I barely understood the proof of Theorem1, but proof of Theorem2 is almost impossible to understand due to the lack of my mathematics background. 
 The question is that, could you tell me what I should study or learn before understanding this kind of proof? What kind of subject or material should I look for in order to understand the flow of the proofs and related definition/notation used in the proof of &#x27;DPG&#x27;?
 I personally think that it is crucial to understand the proofs of the main Theorem because it will help me to understand the authors&#x27; intuition and motivation which can be the foundation of the paper.

                    <span>With recent breakthroughs in AI, humans have become more reliant on AI to address real-world problems. This makes humans’ ability to learn and act on knowledge just as essential as a computer’s. Humans learn and gather information through learning and experience to understand everything from their immediate surroundings. The ability to comprehend and solve issues, and separate facts from absurdities, increases as the knowledge base grows. However, such knowledge is lacking in AI systems, restricting their ability to adapt to atypical problem data.
 Previous studies show that pre-trained language models improve performance on various natural language interpretation and generating tasks.
 A recent work of researchers at Baidu, in collaboration with Peng Cheng Laboratory (PCL), release PCL-BAIDU Wenxin (or “ERNIE 3.0 Titan”), a pre-training language model with 260 billion parameters. It is the world’s first knowledge-enhanced multi-hundred billion parameter model and its largest Chinese singleton model.

                    <span>What have been your favorite reads of 2021 in terms of RL papers? I will start!
 Reward is enough (Reddit Discussion) - Four great names from RL (silver, Singh, Precup and Sutton) give their reasonings as to why using RL can create super intelligence. You might not agree with it, but it&#x27;s interesting to see the standpoint of Deepmind and where they want to take RL.
 Deep Reinforcement Learning at the Edge of the Statistical Precipice (Reddit Discussion) - This is a major step towards a better model comparison in RL. Too many papers in the past have used a selection technique akin to &#x27;average top 30 runs in a total of 100&#x27;. I have also never even heard of Munchausen RL before this paper, and was pleasantly surprised by reading it.
 Mastering Atari with Discrete World Models - Very good read and a nice path from Ha&#x27;s World Models to Dream to Control to DreamerV2. This is one of the methods this year that actually seems to improve performance quite a bit without needing a large scale distributed approach.
 On the Expressivity of Markov Reward (Reddit Discussion) - The last sentence in the blog post captures it for me: &quot;We hope this work provides new conceptual perspectives on reward and its place in reinforcement learning&quot;, it did.
 Open-Ended Learning Leads to Generally Capable Agents (Reddit Discussion) - Great to see the environment integrated into the learning process, seems like something we will see much more of in the future. Unfortunately, as DeepMind does, the environment is not released nor is the code. I remember positions at OpenAI for open-ended learning, perhaps we might see something next year to compete with this.
 ​
 Most of my picks are not practical algorithms. For me, it seems like PPO is still king when looking at performance and simplicity, kind of a disappointment. I probably missed some papers too. What was your favorite paper in RL 2021? Was it Player of Games (why?), something with Offline RL or perhaps Multi Agents?

                    <span>OpenAI used to do a lot of RL research, but it seems like last year and this year the only real RL related work was on benchmark competitions. They even gave away the control of OpenAI Gym. They still have great RL researchers working there, but nothing major has come out.
 Is it all due to a pivot towards large scale language models that are at least profitable? Is Sam Altman just not interested in RL?

                    <span>Most of the Autoencoder examples/blogs use MNIST dataset as the implementation. I have trained an autoencoder on CIFAR-10 which you can refer here. There is a trade-off between making the CNN architecture deeper and the improvement of reconstruction loss/error. Or, using a VAE.
 Thoughts?

                    <span>Viral keratitis, bacterial keratitis, fungal keratitis, and parasitic keratitis are all types of infectious keratitis. Bacterial Keratitis (BK) is a kind of Infectious Keratitis that is one of the most frequent and vision-threatening. Contact lens wear is the most prevalent risk factor for Bacterial Keratitis (BK), and it is becoming increasingly popular around the world for a variety of reasons, including exercise, cosmesis, and myopia management.
 BK is substantially more fulminant and painful in the clinical course than other Infectious Keratitis(s). A delayed diagnosis of Bacterial Keratitis (BK) can result in large-area corneal ulcerations, melting, and even perforation if not treated.
 In the case of Infectious Keratitis, timely detection and treatment of BK are vital goals. However,…</span>

                    <span>Meta AI releases the beta version of Bean Machine, a probabilistic programming framework based on PyTorch that makes it simple to describe and learn about uncertainty in machine learning models used in various applications. Bean Machine makes it possible to create probabilistic models that are domain-specific. It also uses multiple autonomous, uncertainty-aware learning algorithms to learn about the model’s unseen features. Bean Machine gets an early beta version from Meta.

                    <span>On July 03 2021, the subject of media and news sources came up in a
conversation I had with someone over brunch when we were talking about media
bias. I was asked: “what news do you read?” I regret that I gave a sloppy
response that sounded like a worse version of: “uh, I read a variety of news …”
and then I tried listing a few from memory. I wish I had given a crisper
response, and since that day, I have thought about what that person has asked
me every day.
In this blog post, I describe my information diet, referring to how I read
and consume media to understand current events. Before getting to the actual
list of media sources, here are a few comments to clarify my philosophy and
which might also preemptively address common objections.

I would love if some of you can clarify. If say I have 200 faces and 2000 pictures these faces are in (1 face might be in N pictures), in order to find all the pictures that each face is in, that means I will have to run 400,000 transactions ? As in 2000 iterations per face? Or is there a smarter way to do it?
 I know there is an option to index faces but i do not fully understand that yet.
 Thank you for your help!

                    <span>Sharing machine learning experiments to compare its models is important when you&#x27;re working with a team of engineers. You might need to get another opinion on an experiments results or to share a modified dataset or even share the exact reproduction of a specific experiment.
 The following tutorial goes through an example of sharing an experiment with DVC remotes: Running Collaborative Experiments - using DVC remotes to share experiments and their data across machines
 Setting up DVC remotes in addition to your Git remotes lets you share all of the data, code, and hyperparameters associated with each experiment so anyone can pick up where you left off in the training process. When you use DVC, you can bundle your data and code changes for each experiment and push those to a remote for somebody else to check out.

 I want to show a NN some gameplay. But I don’t know how to. I can capture the keystrokes for each frame but I don’t know what to do next. 
 Do I take screenshots and save those frames w the keystrokes to my disk? 
 I kinda know how to use Cv2, Pillow, and the keyboard module. 
 I’m really lost, so any help will be highly appreciated
 Ps- I want the model to learn how to play the game

                    <span>Hi all, the NLP for Semantic Search course that I&#x27;ve been working on has just been released, and today the latest chapter on data augmentation with SBERT has been released too!
 It&#x27;s all completely free and covers everything you need to get started with building SotA language models for semantic similarity, from machine translation to question-answering, and more!
 Semantic search allows us to search language-based data based on the semantics or &#x27;meaning&#x27; of a text, from machine translation to question-answering. It&#x27;s how Google understands &quot;what time is it in NYC?&quot;, and even allows us to search for images using text-based queries.
 It is in essence, a way for us to interact with machines in a more human way. NLP fits in as the &#x27;semantic&#x27; in semantic search.
 Current chapters are: 1. Dense Vectors 2. Sentence Embeddings and Transformers 3. Training Sentence Transformers with Softmax Loss 4. Training Sentence Transformers with MNR Loss 5. Multilingual Sentence Transformers 6. Question Answering 7. Unsupervised Training for Sentence Transformers 8. (New) Data Augmentation With BERT
 Let me know what you think, I hope you enjoy it!

                    <span>As a common and (sometimes) proven belief, deep learning systems seem to learn uninterpretable representations and are far from human understanding. Recently, some studies have highlighted the fact that this may not always be applicable, and some networks may be able to learn human-readable representations. Unfortunately, this ability could merely come from the fact that these networks are exposed to human-generated data. So, to demonstrate their ability to learn like humans (and not that they are simply memorizing human-created labels), it is necessary to test them without any label. 
 Following this idea, the DeepMind and Google Brain teams, together with the 14th world chess champion Vladimir Kramnik, studied their creature AlphaZero from this point of view. AlphaZero is the descendant of AlphaGo, the super neural network that beat the world champion Lee Sedol in a best-of-five GO match, a turning point in the history of deep learning, as can also be seen in the wonderful Netflix documentary AlphaGo. 
 Unlike AlphaGo, AlphaZero is trained through self-play (i.e., it learns to play competing against itself) and masters not only GO but also chess and shogi. This trait makes AlphaZero the perfect case study to explore this idea. Moreover, given the fact that it performs at a superhuman level, understanding its functionality is also particularly useful for highlighting unknown patterns which have never been discovered by chess theorists.

                    <span>Posted by Karan Singhal, Senior Software Engineer, Google Research  
Federated learning enables users to train a model without sending raw data to a central server, thus avoiding the collection of privacy-sensitive data. Often this is done by learning a single global model for all users, even though the users may differ in their data distributions. For example, users of a mobile keyboard application may collaborate to train a suggestion model but have different preferences for the suggestions. This heterogeneity has motivated algorithms that can personalize a global model for each user.  
 However, in some settings privacy considerations may prohibit learning a fully global model. Consider models with user-specific embeddings, such as matrix factorization models for recommender systems. Tr…</span>

 ​
 I&#x27;ve been reading about the differences between normal fully-connected feedforward networks and convolutional neural networks, and I&#x27;m wondering if I understand something about how they subsume one another.
 Is a CNN &quot;just&quot; an ANN where the inputs to the network are convolutions over the input?

For a machine learning (ML) algorithm to be effective, useful features must be extracted from (often) large amounts of training data. However, this process can be made challenging due to the costs associated with training on such large datasets, both in terms of compute requirements and wall clock time. The idea of distillation plays an important role in these situations by reducing the resources required for the model to be effective. The most widely known form of distillation is model distillation (a.k.a. knowledge distillation), where the predictions of large, complex teacher models are distilled into smaller models.  
 An alternative option to this model-space approach is dataset …</span>

                    <span>The shortcomings of supervised RL
Reinforcement Learning (RL) is a powerful paradigm for solving many problems of interest in AI, such as controlling autonomous vehicles, digital assistants, and resource allocation to name a few. We’ve seen over the last five years that, when provided with an extrinsic reward function, RL agents can master very complex tasks like playing Go, Starcraft, and dextrous robotic manipulation. While large-scale RL agents can achieve stunning results, even the best RL agents today are narrow. Most RL algorithms today can only solve the single task they were trained on and do not exhibit cross-task or cross-domain generalization capabilities.
A side-effect of the narrowness of today’s RL systems is that today’s RL agents are also very data inefficient. If we were t…</span>

                    <span>Deep learning technologies, such as automatic learning of temporal dependence and automated handling of temporal structures like trends and seasonality, hold a lot of promise for time series forecasting. Most real-world datasets include a temporal component. Therefore projecting the future can be pretty beneficial. In time series machine learning, multi-horizon forecasting, or predicting variables-of-interest at several future time steps, is a critical challenge.
 Deep neural networks (DNNs) are increasingly being employed in multi-horizon forecasting, and they have been shown to outperform classic time series models. Unlike most models that focus on recurrent neural network (RNN) variants, recent works use attention-based layers to improve the selection of relevant time steps in the past beyond the inductive bias of RNNs – sequential ordered processing of information including. However, they frequently ignore the standard inputs in multi-horizon forecasting, assuming that all exogenous inputs are known in the future or ignoring crucial static variables.

Multi-horizon forecasting, i.e. predicting variables-of-interest at multiple future time steps, is a crucial challenge in time series machine learning. Most real-world datasets have a time component, and forecasting the future can unlock great value. For example, retailers can use future sales to optimize their supply chain and promotions, investment managers are interested in forecasting the future prices of financial assets to maximize their performance, and healthcare institutions can use the number of future patient admissions to have sufficient personnel and equipment.
