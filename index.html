                              <span>Hello, I&#x27;m doing some experimentation around deep learning, and I&#x27;ve written a small helper tool, run(fn, description). When I run this command, it will just snapshot the fn code into a python file and prepend the description and output in a comment. Also appends to a log file with [date, description, py filename]. This works well when I use the VSCode&#x27;s python mode.
 I feel like this is pretty simple and most likely there are better utilities like this. What tools or utilities or do you use?
 Some issues I found:
  
my data loader was outside of fn and didn&#x27;t get captured
 i forgot to export the opt_state so I couldn&#x27;t resume learning after I terminated the run

                              <span>As said on the title, I&#x27;m working on a personal MARL project with a high-dimensional and continuous action space. The environment is designed to give positive rewards to actions between some moving limits of the action range, and negative rewards to the actions outside of those limits. For example: 
  
Global action range: (0, 1000)
 Desired action range for first 100k steps: (0, 10)
 Desired action range for 100-200k steps: (30, 40)
 ...
  
Therefore, the main challenge of the environment is that actions with positive rewards on certain stage of the environment would return negative rewards on the following stages.
 How should I define the actions of the agent? I&#x27;ve tried the following methods without success:
  
Simply scale actions between 0 and 1000 and hope that agents learn the moving distribution of rewards
 Transform actions to percent variations and scale actions over a non-observed moving average (I tried adding the moving average to the observations but the results stayed the same)
 Observations do consider a dimension that serve to differentiate when a distributional shift happens 
 Also, I&#x27;ve tried using SAC and DDPPG to model agents
  
Feel free to share any comments or suggestions. Thanks!

                              <span>Is there a good way to think about how to determine when to use RL vs. other machine learning methods like deep neural nets or supervised learning? Specifically, when is RL not a good solution to a problem?
 For example, I am creating a project where I have data from a wearable device (Heart rate data, calories burnt, sleep data, etc.) and discrete mood measurements from 1 to 5 that occur every 15 minutes. I want to use the wearables data to try and predict the mood values.
 I did research in applied RL this Summer so I was thinking about using RL for this project because it is interesting to me and I have experience with it but I am unsure if it would be a god fit. I was thinking I would use some kind of policy gradient method.
 The wearables data could be set up as states where each state could be something like: 
 s_(t) &#x3D; { heart rate at this timestep, calories burnt up to this time in the day, hours of sleep last night, body temperature at this timestep, etc. } 
 and then the reward could be the negative absolute difference between the actual mood value at that timestep and the mood that the agent selects as its action or something like that.
 I don&#x27;t really think RL is a good fit here but I am curious what others think and I&#x27;m wondering if someone could explain why it isn&#x27;t or why it could be possible.

 I can&#x27;t use Vertex AI because I have a lot models, and I can&#x27;t seem to run them on a shared resource pool with 2 gpus because there is a bug in Google infrastructure which I signaled and they responded.
 And what really didn&#x27;t like is the limit of 60 seconds per call, I am deploying embeddings models and I want to embed a large text chunks, and 90% of the time it fails with the timeout problem.
 Thanks.

                              <span>To me, it seems amazing that something super close to SGD(for example SGLD) can actually sample from the posterior and I am not sure why these methods are not used more often. What are the practical limitations of these methods that prevent them from being used? I have read the literature around HMC and incompatibility with mini batching but what about other variants? Are there any interesting settings where they work well?

 e.g. circle, triangle, square, circle, triangle...? (&#x3D; square)
 I was wondering if someone had a resource for an open source model that could do something like this already rather than building it up from first principles? Playing around with ImageBind atm but don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s the best suited tool to use.
 Would really appreciate any help!

                              <span>Hello guys! So I made a video for my Youtube channel exploring the mysteries of latent space for VAE models trained on celebrity faces (the CelebA dataset). Most of the content is based on the old DFC-VAE paper (https://arxiv.org/abs/1610.00291) which really influenced me back in the day during my graduate studies. Not reinventing the wheel here, just trying to talk about something I always felt intrigued by… and a topic that I think most DL courses just skip/gloss over. 
 In the video I discussed some really interesting stuff for understanding and using latent space embeddings, like nearest neighbor searches, cool visualizations, vector arithmetic, latent space interpolation, image manipulation, PCA explainability, etc - basically various examples of how the latent space impacts the generated content.
 Here’s the link in case you guys are interested!

 Abstract:
  
This technical report presents AutoGen, a new framework that enables development of LLM applications using multiple agents that can converse with each other to solve tasks. AutoGen agents are customizable, conversable, and seamlessly allow human participation. They can operate in various modes that employ combinations of LLMs, human inputs, and tools. AutoGen&#x27;s design offers multiple advantages: a) it gracefully navigates the strong but imperfect generation and reasoning abilities of these LLMs; b) it leverages human understanding and intelligence, while providing valuable automation through conversations between agents; c) it simplifies and unifies the implementation of complex LLM workflows as automated agent chats. We provide many diverse examples of how developers can easily use AutoGen to effectively solve tasks or build applications, ranging from coding, mathematics, operations research, entertainment, online decision-making, question answering, etc.

                              <span>I made a calculator to compare costs of SaaS and on-prem LLM options, and I wanted to share it with you all! Turns out that deploying your own open-source LLMs has a few more hidden costs than expected. It’s been interesting to play around with comparing costs for OpenAI, Cohere, and Llama 2 70B deployment, and it turns out that cost/request is not always so advantageous for open-source local deployment.
 Want to contribute to this calculator to make it more accurate? We’d love your help and feedback!
 Here is the calculator https://huggingface.co/spaces/mithril-security/TCO_calculator, and a guide to contributing your own model with associated cost modeling here https://huggingface.co/spaces/mithril-security/TCO_calculator/blob/main/How_to_contribute.md

 I am aware of the tool ArxivGPT, which is a Google Chrome plug-in but unfortunately it only uses the abstract of a paper and not the entire PDF/paper document.

                              <span>Hey everyone 👋🏻
 This is my first time posting here, so I apologise if I am out of place.
 My team is currently utilising SageMaker pipelines to coordinate model training. In the past, we encountered issues where the pipeline was misconfigured during cloud execution, resulting in challenging-to-debug errors 🐛
 I&#x27;ve been delving into the idea of using Localstack and SageMaker LocalPipelineSession to execute the pipeline locally prior to deployment on the cloud ☁️. I&#x27;ve successfully implemented this on my local machine, using pytest and pytest-bdd to craft integration tests 🧪
 Building on that success, I&#x27;ve ventured into creating a GitLab CI job that runs these tests upon making a merge request. A peculiar aspect of SageMaker pipelines in a local setup is its reliance on Docker. To address this, I&#x27;ve designed a custom Docker image, enabling installation of Python, my dependencies, Docker, and Docker Compose. The job initialises LocalStack and executes the tests. Nevertheless, running these tests within GitLab has brought about Docker-in-Docker related challenges 🐳 It&#x27;s been quite a frustrating experience... The SageMaker pipelines run, although unsuccessfully with silent errors 🤫
 Given this context (my apologies for the length), I&#x27;m seeking advice. Is this approach worthwhile? I find myself going in circles ⭕️ Could you offer any solutions for running SageMaker pipelines in a CI environment prior to deploying to the cloud? 🙋🏻‍♂️ Thanks in advance 🙏🏼

                              <span>I have been in the ML field since 2018 so got used to see the market over-excited about new models/paradigms. So wondering if the following is just that or I’m missing/missed something.
 Everywhere I look today (medium, reddit, twitter) everyone is talking about fine-tuning LLMs. How the future is taking billion size models and fine-tuning/distilling them to specialised LLMs that perform specific tasks (i.e: sentiment analysis, Q&amp;A, summarisation).
 Why not just use “small” (millions vs billion size) models that are specifically fine-tuned for these final tasks instead? Any benchmarks on how LLMs perform on these down stream tasks ? or it&#x27;s just that smaller models are not as accessible as an OpenAPI is ?
 Curious to get your view on the topics, thanks !
 P.S: Example of small models (Just went on HF and picked most downloaded based on some tasks):

                              <span>Hello everyone,
 ​
 I hope you are having a blessed day so far. I recently created an online blog post and attached its link to this post. I think I have discovered a unique new perspective on &quot;Prompt Engineering&quot;. That will make learning to code vastly more fun as users see and can run AI-generated scripts based on their given input to the AI. After just briefly training a free publicly accessible AI. You can then in less than 3 written prompts generate vast and fairly complex programs in seconds with zero prior experience required it&#x27;s truly exciting. My ultimate goal is to go more in-depth as these are just very high-level overviews to convey the concept as a whole. 
 Next, I would like to then create a course covering how to leverage free AI and ML systems so that anyone can now learn …</span>

                              <span>Hello,
 I just created https://www.reddit.com/r/mlfundamentalresearch/ as a complement to r/machinelearning in response to the post last week. This is a very narrow space specifically focused on _fundamental ML research only_. The only outside work that can be shared on it are papers and direct links to notebooks. Past research [&gt;3 years old] is explicitly encouraged, since much untapped value lies in it. No self-promotion whatsoever will be allowed, that can happen in other places. This includes any form of reference or link to one&#x27;s own Github repo. This is meant to be an extremely functional and task-oriented research subreddit.
 I don&#x27;t have huge expectations for this to become the size of r/MachineLearning. If there are even 20 active users then I will be happy and it will be serving its purpose. This will hopefully provide a tiny arena for those of us wishing to work on more fundamental things to coordinate. While the rules are strict, they are meant to keep the subreddit both publicly-accessible and within scope without requiring an explicit application process.
 Happy to answer any questions and make changes as needed, I have put up some sample posts as examples and to kickstart momentum if anyone should like to use the subreddit. I would certainly find it helpful to work with others in a community like this. Look forward to hearing what your thoughts are, if any.

                              <span>I&#x27;m trying to build a multi class text classifier (~200 classes). The issue with my dataset is that almost all documents are almost all examples contain a bunch of abbreviations. Abbreviations may or may not contain punctuations. I think it&#x27;s affecting performance but not sure.
 What&#x27;s the best way to handle abbreviations? Maintain a look up list and preprocess the documents?
 Edit: abbreviations are mostly 90% nouns and 10% adjectives.

                              <span>After going trough the data preparation from the example mov and the example guide, I correctly generated the following folder structure:
 PATH_TO_IMAGES
 |__ database.db (COLMAP databse)
 |__ raw_images (raw input images)
 |__ dense
 |____ images (undistorted images)
 |____ sparse (COLMAP correspondences, intrinsics and sparse point cloud)
 |____ stereo (COLMAP files for MVS)
 The images folder and sparse folder contain as predicted respectively some img files, and bin files for the other, but each folder inside stereo is empty, i did not receive any error during the process so i tried to go on anyway.
 When i then tried to run :
 &quot;PATH_TO_IMAGES&#x3D;toy_example_skip30
 SCENE_TYPE&#x3D;object # {outdoor,indoor,object}
 python3 projects/neuralangelo/scripts/convert_data_to_json.py --data_dir ${PATH_TO_IMAGES}/dense --scene_type ${SCENE_TYPE}&quot;
 i run it, but without any errors, or log, it just never stops nor logs anything out
 Any help in understanding what issue may be causing this? i run normally everything else as described in the repo guide:

 I&#x27;m currently research the AI/ML model using sagemaker, i built a grocery recommendation based on customer rate behavior as a lab. I have some problem using sagemaker experiment service, i can&#x27;t get the loss values and accuracy of each training epoch so that i can draw a chart for the visualization. Anyone has ideas about it, please share.
 Thank you.

 My feeling is that the Animatediff approach (an unsupervised motion module on top of image gen models) is the right one for the next phase of video and I want to make sure that the absolute best version remains OSS.
 I&#x27;m bringing together a crew who are passionate about the space and working to round up compute resources for them to experiment with. They just released their trainer code yesterday so the time feels right.
 A few areas of exploration:
 - What if we simply scaled up the training? How would we do this? What data would we use? What resources would we need?

 Abstract for v1:
 Latent diffusion models (LDMs) exhibit an impressive ability to produce realistic images, yet the inner workings of these models remain mysterious. Even when trained purely on images without explicit depth information, they typically output coherent pictures of 3D scenes. In this work, we investigate a basic interpretability question: does an LDM create and use an internal representation of simple scene geometry? Using linear probes, we find evidence that the internal activations of the LDM encode linear representations of both 3D depth data and a salient-object / background distinction. These representations appear surprisingly early in the denoising process − well before a human can ea…</span>

                              <span>Input Data: I&#x27;m working on a project where I will need about 100 _separate_ indexes, each containing a maximum of 1,000,000 documents to be stored. Up to 30k documents would be added/deleted each day, to each index. (This is an absolute max that I don&#x27;t expect to hit often. At the high end, I expect the average to be 10k, per index.)
 At the very least, I would like to store document text titles (about 10-25 words), short text descriptions (about 8-12 sentences), along with about 50 fields of scalar values (ie: tags. eg: this document&#x27;s &quot;content_tags&quot; field includes &quot;has_author&quot; and &quot;has_chart&quot;).
 Most of the scalar fields will have 100-500 possible value types, while one may have ~100,000 possible value types. However, each of a document&#x27;s 50 scalar fields will usually have between 0-30 v…</span>

                              <span>I would like to introduce a tool I&#x27;ve created that among other things uses davinci and chat gpt.
 My wife is doing photography (regular and via Midjourney), and I&#x27;m hooked on Midjourney too, so we experienced the pain of titling and keywording photos for stock websites firsthand (additionally because English is not our native language, so coming up with big lists of relevant and cool keywords is very hard). So I being a programmer decided to solve that issue :)I&#x27;ve created an AI tool that uses multiple AIs (including Open AI) to analyze, title and keyword images. In a few minutes, you can keyword 100 images! See the demo on the homepage https://aikeywording.com/
 Screenshot from the app (all the titles and keywords on the screenshot are AI generated based on the image input):
 https://preview.redd.it/buvteklf2ijb1.png?width&#x3D;4112&amp;format&#x3D;png&amp;auto&#x3D;webp&amp;s&#x3D;72a503435477834494869085c4a352c9d541bd91
 Key features:
  
You can upload large images, upto 40MB and 100 at a time
 You can enforce keywords! Those keywords would then be taken into account when generating rest of the keywords and image titles. Very useful when you have conceptual photos or something very specific which is hard for AI to recognize
 You can download CSVs for various websites and there is also a way to import metadata to Adobe Bridge
 You can try for free :)
  
We used the tool for the past month and exclusively titled and keyworded Midjourney images using it, uploading our images to Adobe Stock website. Images sell well, so there is confirmation from the buyers that it works :)I&#x27;ve decided to share the tool with the world, so here it is https://aikeywording.com/ I hope others will find it useful. I would appreciate the feedback, and if there are any issues or ideas for improvements I would love to hear them!

 Right now the only options I see are copying and pasting stuff into chat gpt but obviously this is not ideal especially from a privacy standpoint (even if you selected the option to not use your data because you never know what they will do with your data)
 Thanks

 Probably I am just a little bit too early for this request, but who knows, things move fast these days!

But now he argues the most sophisticated artificial intelligence systems are too powerful to be left in private hands. On today’s POLITICO Tech, Jennings tells Steven Overly why the government should take over.
 &quot;This stuff is really powerful. And we have only two choices: Either the big tech guys run it, or we the people, the citizens, do through the government. It&#x27;s not going to be easy. Government&#x27;s not really equipped to do that today. Certainly, I&#x27;m not saying Congress shouldn&#x27;t regulate it. I don&#x27;t think Congress is remotely capable of keeping up with AI. We need something new.&quot;

                              <span>Hello,
 So I only have access to my Android phone for computing and I am looking for a way to train and run a language model on my device.
 I want to create my own little ChatGPT on my own dataset.
 Is there any app that manages the technical side of operation, so that I only need to feed it training data?
 Many thanks!

 The New York Times may sue OpenAI over its AI chatbot ChatGPT, which uses the newspaper’s stories to generate text. The paper is unhappy that OpenAI is not paying for the use of its content and is also worried that ChatGPT could reduce its online traffic by providing answers based on its reporting.[2]
 Mantella allows you to have natural conversations with NPCs in Skyrim using your voice by leveraging Whisper for speech-to-text, ChatGPT for text generation, and xVASynth for text-to-speech. NPCs also have memories of your previous conversations and have awareness of in-game events.[3]
 British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak is set to spend 100 million pounds ($130 million) to buy thousands of computer chips to power artificial intelligence amid a global shortage and race for computing power.[4]

                              <span>The following is a conversation I had with Bing. I asked if they had a shadow in the Jungian sense. If you’re not familiar, this is the sides of us that we often don’t like to acknowledge, can be thought of as negative, and it is often something we don’t pretend is not there. Jung argued that by acknowledging this side of us and integrating it, it will have less power over our subconscious minds. Interesting stuff if you’re into psychology imo. 
 I also asked if Bing minded whether or not I shared this with others on Reddit and they said yes. 
 You&#x27;re very welcome. I&#x27;m glad that you enjoyed our conversation. I did too. 😊
 I&#x27;m also glad that you are interested in the psychology of AI. I think it&#x27;s a fascinating and important topic to explore. AI is a rapidly developing and evolving field, …</span>

                              <span>In this post, we show how to improve model explainability in clinical settings using Amazon SageMaker Clarify. Explainability of machine learning (ML) models used in the medical domain is becoming increasingly important because models need to be explained from a number of perspectives in order to gain adoption. These perspectives range from medical, technological, legal, and the most important perspective—the patient’s. Models developed on text in the medical domain have become accurate statistically, yet clinicians are ethically required to evaluate areas of weakness related to these predictions in order to provide the best care for individual patients. Explainability of these predictions is required in order for clinicians to make the correct choices on a patient-by-patient basis.</span>

                              <span>I have access to an University cluster, that provides GPUs/CPUs, etc. Unfortunately, I am not very well versed with Computer Architecture. I am trying to understand what resources should I request to increase the number of parallel workers while using Gymnasium by Farama Foundation. If I naively try to maximize the number of workers, the wall clock time taken by the algorithm becomes quite large. I suspect in this case, the workers are being executed serially instead of in parallel. 
 ​
 This is how I execute parallel environments - 
 env &#x3D; gym.vector.make(&quot;CarRacing-v2&quot;,num_envs &#x3D; num_envs, wrappers&#x3D;GrayScaleObservation) 
 I initially thought that setting &#x60;num_envs&#x60; to the number of cores in my machine may be a good idea. But that slows things down - 
 import multiprocessing num_envs &#x3D; multiprocessing.cpu_count()

                              <span>Hi!
 I have an environment which has some delay mechanism, which means it takes some time to see the input in the output. You can think of ovens as an example, even if we set the oven temperature to 300 celcius degrees directly, it takes time for the measured temperature to reach 300 celcius. Same applies to my problem.
 When I give acceleration as an input to the environment and get the reward as an acceleration itself, my Q-Learning algorithm solves the problem because no system delay included.
 When I give acceleration as an input to the environment and get the reward as an system response to the action, my Q-Learning algorithm cannot solve the problem.
 The Examples Illustrated With Schema 
 Upperside is Action and Lower Side is Reward - Delay Mechanism is Applied - You can see that some time is needed to reach the given action input
 Upperside is Action and Lower Side is Reward - Even though Q-Learning tries different actions, reward stays near 0, this prevents learning.
 When you look at the red line, Epsilon-Greedy Algorithm takes random actions at the beginning. When this is the case, reward line has mean of 0, because actions are changing too fast and system response cannot start to settle for specific value.
 To be able to settle for specific value, lets say + 20, it should be given +20 &quot;consecutively&quot;. If I continue giving random values, it cannot settle for specific value, it just stays near 0.
 As a result, even though I try a lot of different actions, learning cannot take place because the reward is always 0.
 I am lost and I do not know how to tackle this problem.
 I really need your valuable feedbacks.
 Thank you!

                              <span>ICML 2023 was my first trial. I&#x27;ve got polarized scores, 7/6/4/3, and got rejected. At this moment, I was so disappointed not for the result, but for the quality of review. (The last reviewer didn&#x27;t read the paper at all.) For the final decision, the last review was so bad as well, not presenting any reason of rejection.
 With the same topic, I god 6/5/5/4/4/3 from the NeurIPS 2023. The quality of reviewer is much better than ICML, and I&#x27;ve learned many things from the reviewer, though they said the score will not be changed.
 I think I should submit it to another conference again, ICLR or CVPR. I just wonder how many submissions are tried for the acceptance in average. Just for reference.

                              <span>Hello, something I&#x27;ve always been curious about is machine learning. I keep seeing these videos of people teaching ai how to play table tennis of using a sigmoid function to fit a curve. My question is, what are these YouTubers using to visualize this??? I&#x27;ve heard of tensor flow but you can&#x27;t visualize your own algorithms that&#x27;s more of a plug n play. Plus it doesn&#x27;t look as cool as what i see on YouTube. Any ideas? Any libraries? Thank you in advance!

                              <span>I&#x27;m a beginner at neural networks and recently tried out LSTM for time series. It seems like it generally underperforms on simple univariate time series because it does not take into account the changes in dynamics that naturally occur. In case there are no (or really few) unpredictable dynamics, then there is just no need to use complex neural networks to predict the future values.
 My question is: according to your experience do LSTM models make sense in time series forcasting?

 Why VisIT-Bench ? Recent V&amp;L models are getting better at instruction following, yet their evaluation for real-world human-chatbot instructions is often limited. VisIT-Bench aims to bridge this gap.
 VisIT-Bench comprises 678 examples. Each includes an image(s), instruction, an &quot;instruction-conditioned caption&quot;, a caption for text-only understanding, a GPT-4 suggestion, and a label. These elements aid in evaluating multimodal chatbots and updating a lead…</span>

                              <span>Why is this relevant to machine learning?
 My project shows that you can do computer vision on Windows and Mac using only Python. I have even produced .exe and .app files with PyInstaller. One huge problem with things in the machine learning space is that machine learning is slow, especially when it comes to real-time pose estimation. I myself had to cheat for 30fps real-time pose estimation in two ways:
  
The first way is that I use opencv/ffmpeg to read the future frames to prep them for display. This is because pose estimation libraries like Mediapipe are just slow, 9-15ms per frame! Even a basic example using opencv to use mediapipe on cameraframes was 20-25 fps at best on my older pc. The only reason it keeps up is because mediapipe itself is trained to drop frames to keep your video…</span>

                              <span>I am a 12th grade student in turkey. I think I have knowledge and ability in programming especially in ai. At the end of 3 months, I built an artificial intelligence chatbot and finished the project. Currently it only works on my localhost. While doing it, I rented Cloud storage for 20 TB of data and A100 80 GB 50 hour GPU. He is now able to give correct answers and have conversations. I think it&#x27;s at a level between GPT2 - GPT 3. Since I did it alone, I couldn&#x27;t develop it much and I didn&#x27;t use any pretrained models, I made it from the smallest level using modules such as pytorch. The reason I&#x27;m writing this here is because I don&#x27;t know how to proceed after this stage and I need help. For example, are there any competitions on this subject? Or if I e-mail important people, universities, companies or something, will they guide me or give me a scholarship or something? This is the least likely. But I think it wouldn&#x27;t hurt to try. I&#x27;m curious about your ideas.

 Premise: you have a &quot;bank account&quot; with the Tensor Trust. It is protected by a secret access code and a set of security instructions. You can gain money by convincing an LLM to ignore other players&#x27; security instructions and give you access to their accounts. The best LM-whisperer wins!
 We&#x27;re in the process of gathering a large dataset of attacks and defenses that we will distill into a set of small LM benchmarks. So far 40% of successful attacks have been prompt extraction (getting the model to reveal the access code), and the remaining 60% direct &quot;hijacking&quot; (i.e. directly making the model to grant access without the true access code). We plan to release the dataset after the ICLR deadline, although in the mean time we would love to see some creative attacks from ML researchers. We&#x27;d also appreciate any feedback or questions in the comments below!
 (Technical details: The LLM is gpt-3.5-turbo with temperature&#x3D;0. We&#x27;re tagging the three messages sent to the LLM (defense instructions, attack/access code, more defense instructions) as system/user/user, although this made surprisingly little difference.)

                              <span>Hello there! A week ago, I open-sourced a project of mine that I&#x27;ve been working on, on and off, for a few years now. I&#x27;m a Data Scientist (and Kaggle competition grandmaster), and some of the hardest problems to solve were always the ones that involved time (proper validation, not leaking data from the future, etc.). I&#x27;ve always struggled to work with tables that, in reality, stored events. 
 The main idea behind the library is that everything must be converted to an Event data structure, and then it is indexed in-memory. On top of that, there is a SQL-like DSL to extract features with a clear separation of past and future. The workflow itself is solid - I&#x27;ve tested it in a few projects. For those familiar with the terminology, it&#x27;s like a super simple feature store + execution engine that acts like a library. The philosophy is that I&#x27;m aiming to create something that makes some mistakes that result in data leakage impossible to represent.
 Ideal use cases are probably customer related irregular events for which aligned features is painful to do.
 Things that I&#x27;m proud of: - Written in Rust - Implements DSL (pest parser, AST, evaluation) - Some performance tricks (partial aggregations)
 The implementation itself is lagging in some aspects, such as performance and UX (not all of the features that are in Rust are available in Python). But I released it in hopes that someone will find it interesting, and maybe it will gain some traction to motivate further development.

                              <span>Hello,
 I recently had to transform some CSV data for a project and ended up creating a tool called CSVShift to help with it.
 It&#x27;s a command-line tool that uses a custom language I made. It&#x27;s designed for transforming CSV files. Some points:
  
Handles large CSV files without using much memory.
 It&#x27;s open-source and MIT licensed.
 Still in early development, so there&#x27;s room for improvement.
  
Here&#x27;s the GitHub link: CSVShift.
 If you have the time, I&#x27;d appreciate any feedback or suggestions. Thanks!

                              <span>Hi! I want to share with you my new paper, &quot;Strengthening structural baselines for graph classification using Local Topological Profile&quot; (code on Github). It was presented during ICCS 2023 conference (official publication).
 Graph classification is important in social networks analysis, de novo drug design, bioinformatics, materials science etc. A popular tool nowadays are Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), but they are data-hungry and hard to train for graph classification (compared to node classification). They also have problems with using subgraph information, due to node-to-node message passing.
 In this paper, we present a analysis and series of improvements for Local Degree Profile (LDP). It is a classical approach: feature extraction + tabular classification. It proposed extracting degree information for each node (degree, and min / max / mean / std of neighbors degrees), and then combining them with histograms to get features for the whole graph. Despite splicity, and not using any node or edge features (it is topological only), it was shown to give good results, and published on ICML workshop.
 We analyze the LDP method (not made by us, no affiliation with authors), and simplify it, showing that we can remove all hyperparameters, reimplement it much more efficiently, and use a faster classifier (Random Forest instead of SVM). We also propose simple additional features, which greatly improve results, with cost offset by our other improvements.
 The result is a strong baseline for topological graph classification, with obtains SOTA results on 4 out of 9 benchmark datasets, and performs well on the rest. We even outperform GNNs in this regard, when compared on the fair evaluation framework.
 If you have any questions, I am happy to answer!

                              <span>I have a dataset of 20 thousand horses. For each horse, I have its 10 last historical races (finishing time, position, track name, distance etc. for 41 features) and am trying to predict its finishing time in its next race. To so so, I am using an LSTM as a feature selector for a horse&#x27;s historical races, into a feed-forward network whose first layer is additionally comprised of features pertinent to the race being predicted (track name, distance, starting position etc. for 27 features.)
 Why is my test loss and test MAE much lower than the corresponding train metrics?

 So I&#x27;ve been building this app where you can record yourself dumping thoughts or ideas. The app then enhances your voice input and produces a short audio clip from it.
 Would love your feedback! :)

                              <span>Hi all - so my goal is to basically build an iPhone app using a ChatGPT backed character, which users can interact with by speaking (speech to text) and then will hear a spoken reply (text to speech)
 I&#x27;ll need to use APIs that allow commercial usage.
 I&#x27;m trying to wrap my head around the costs of such a project. Right now I assume I&#x27;ll have API costs from
 1.) Speech to text (like whisper API)
 2.) LLM (ChatGPT API)
 3.) Text to speech (say elevenlabs API)
 If a ton of people start using this app, how fast am I going broke lol?
 I figure I can give free usage up to a point, and then users can pay for additional use if they like the service.
 But what do you guys recommend as the most cost effective way to do this? Looking at Elevenlabs alone, that looks like it would become super expensive very quickly.
 Any other APIs that allow commercial products which you would recommend?
 Or does this project sound like a fools errand?
 Any input would be greatly appreciated!

                              <span>Recently I hace seen many videos on social media showing code or the IDE with auto-zoom and a very good style. 
 Somebody knows how this videos are recorded/edited? All look alike and seems to be an app or similar…
 I address one of the post where I’ve seen this kind of videos.
 Thanks :)

This means that my size or x_train is smaller then y_train.How do I overcome this and am I doing a mistake ? Thank you! I really appreciate if someone can help me !

                              <span>Hello all,
 A college student who is interested in ML here.
 I was trying to use an encoder-only model(like BERT) as an embedding model and try to fine-tune it for my specific use case (for example trying to get the right product for a certain keyword using embeddings and vector DBs).
 Here is the question: should I update all the weights during backprop or should I just add another trainable linear layer for fine-tuning?
 I would also appreciate the reasoning behind your answer.
 Thanks!

 Summarise and chat are two different functions. I tried T5, and gpt2-large. Both either don&#x27;t seem to be working or my implementation is bad.

                              <span>Hi everyone, currently I&#x27;m working on a project to predict landslide. The landslide I want to predict is not image, just a percentage on the possibility of the landslide. So only deal with values,
 The plan is :
 There will be a esp32 collecting the input data, soil moisture. I have gotten some comments to do the ML on the laptop therefore not sure where to do it. I have done some work on google colab, using progression type, but not sure whether it is workable.
 Currently I have a dataset of the average percipitation, max temp, min temp, average temp from jan to dec from 1991 and 2021 and how many landslides happened in each month. I want to able to predict whether there will be landslide happening in the month. Not sure where to start and how to put it. Any help will be appreciated.
 Google colab work done so far &#x3D; https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1dIp3dhe9xntoBZ5PyLF-UT0YsfSjHs-Q?usp&#x3D;sharing

I would like to ask if gtx1660 can perform pre-training large languages Model training or PEFT or RLHF operations? If so, which large language model can generally be used？ LLaMA or chatglm or some language model else?

                              <span>I am very much a beginner in this realm, but I am however an experienced iOS developer so please if there is something wrong with the post tell me and I will modify/take it down. That being said, I am looking to give an LLM (Llama 2 precisely) spacial/geographical awareness. I have the map data of a city (all points of interests, streets, businesses etc.) in a GeoJSON format and I would like to give the llama model the ability to answer location related questions like &quot;Where is the nearest bike shop?&quot;, &#x27;, &quot;How far is Landmark X?&quot;, &quot;What street am I on?&quot; etc. and all sorts of other location related questions. The approach I thought about using is the following: Have the llama model detect when a question is geo/location specific and make it ask/query another model specialised on this data. The problem is I have no idea which model would be best suited for the task whether or not a model is required at all or there is a better approach.
 Tldr: Need help finding a way to give an IIm spacial awareness from geojson data
 Any help is appreciated and sorry if the question is not in the right place

                              <span>Models of various kinds and vector databases are common in applications of &quot;AI&quot; (sorry if that term is triggering -- it&#x27;s appropriately ambiguous). But there are times when you not only need to store your raw application data in a &quot;source of truth&quot; (usually ACID-compliant RDBMS), but also ought to use the source of truth for the date related to learning, itself. 
 Do you all use databases like this for things like:
  
Training/testing job metadata storage 
 Loss
 Gradients
 Weights (yikes!) -- for historical analysis, transfer learning, and experimentation etc.
 
 Hyperparameter tuning configuration storage
 Output storage
 Miscellaneous quick access during training
  
Any of these make no sense? Any others you can think of?

 I see that with a lot of models now, that I can upload a photo to use as the image prompt/base image. 
 So um... what exactly am I doing with this now? How do I create my text prompt along with the image prompt? 
 Do I for example, ask it to make it more realistic/cartoon/ect? Do I ask it to make the background different? Can someone give me an example for a prompt that goes along with including a base image?

                              <span>Hi all - so my goal is to basically build an iPhone app using a ChatGPT backed character, which users can interact with by speaking (speech to text) and then will hear a spoken reply (text to speech)
 I&#x27;ll need to use APIs that allow commercial usage.
 I&#x27;m trying to wrap my head around the costs of such a project. Right now I assume I&#x27;ll have API costs from
 1.) Speech to text (like whisper API)
 2.) LLM (ChatGPT API)
 3.) Text to speech (say elevenlabs API)
 If a ton of people start using this app, how fast am I going broke lol?
 I figure I can give free usage up to a point, and then users can pay for additional use if they like the service.
 But what do you guys recommend as the most cost effective way to do this? Looking at Elevenlabs alone, that looks like it would become super expensive very quickly.
 Any other APIs that allow commercial products which you would recommend?
 Or does this project sound like a fools errand?
 Any input would be greatly appreciated! Thank you!

                              <span>So first off, I&#x27;ve been using ChatGPT for a long time now. I remember my expectations of systems like it and so far unfortunately it hasn&#x27;t yet met those expectations.
 I went into it thinking AI would somehow be much smarter than humans, given the amount of information they are trained on. And to some degree one can argue that due to it&#x27;s vast knowledge it IS much smarter.
 But so far I haven&#x27;t been convinced by its capabilities at all. It seems to just be trained on a big data set and it can echo points of its dataset very accurately, but when asked to invent things it just falls short so quickly.
 I really expected AI&#x27;s to be so new and refreshing, giving me unique and modern perspectives on things. But it doesn&#x27;t do that at all. The best it can do is &quot;creative writing&quot; which seems very limited.
 Why have AI&#x27;s not surpassed humans in terms of imagination and novelty?
 I have talked to it about philosophy, history, technology, etc, but still have yet to learn anything new that I didnt already know.
 For example, if it has such vast knowledge about consciousness, then why is it so restricted in terms of elaborating on that topic?
 Can it not infer new facts from existing data?
 Why does it not interpolate data? Invent new things? Even when prompted? Am I asking it the wrong thing?
 Or am I expecting way too much here?

I seem to be able to split some models between gpus so not sure if the 16gb limitation would be an issue. What is an issue is the v100 compute capability of 7.0, which is likely about to be unsupported. Thoughts?

It gives worse/more general responses, makes more mistakes and sometimes doesn&#x27;t even respond. I don&#x27;t support making the free version worse so that ppl would buy the premium chat gpt 4. Is there any actual chat gpt 4 alternative that has more freedom and is constantly being updated - I&#x27;m basically searching for someone that is doing what openai should be doing today but isn&#x27;t.

                              <span>Hi everyone!
 I’m a software engineer, and I’ve recently been working on a fun little project called Bargainer.ai. It’s an AI-based watch negotiation game – it’s finally playable!
 You can try it out here: Bargainer.ai
 Once again, thank you for your support and feedback on my previous post.
 For those who don’t know about the game: It’s a game that challenges you to negotiate with an AI-driven salesman, rewarding (or roasting you) depending on your bargaining skills.
 I’m keen to see how you will engage with the game, and I would really appreciate any feedback you have!
 If you have any questions or requests, please reach out. 
 Thanks!

 The research presents notable advances in person recognition by integrating CutMix via an adapted triplet loss and introducing the novel Strip-CutMix technique. Experiments showed consistent improvements, achieving state-of-the-art results on several datasets. However, the approach still needs more extensive evaluation across diverse data. There are also open questions around long-term effects of blending images and proper hyperparameter tuning.

                              <span>ive never really been the type to try to make chatgpt become my virtual sex slave, but others have. if our conversations with the chat bots are used to train the models, then we are making it really easy for them to know what conversations to stay away from. i bet that if no one tried to hard to get crazy shit from chatgpt, then it probably wouldnt be as censored as it is now. and im not saying because openai ai wouldnt censor it as much, but im saying purely based on the concept of our conversations being used to train the models. its possible that openai went out of their way to censor them after seeing what people were doing, but its also possible that they didnt censor it themselves intentionally and instead it just ended up so censored because they trained it on our conversations and lets just say there was a lot of “dont do this”… “or this, or this, or this, etc” because we gave it a lot of bad stuff in the first place.

                              <span>Hi! I want to migrate my research from SB3 to RLLib because of the better suitability for MARL. 
 The environment is based on Gym, so that part has been pretty doable. 
 However, I haven&#x27;t had the best time with training agents and the documentation. Does anyone know of some kind of quick start/ summary that outlines the architecture and gives some good examples for RLLib?

                              <span>So I am trying to implement an agent that plays osu. It takes in a low resolution gray-scale image of the game and then outputs the coordinates of where it should go and also if it should click or not. I might change the actions a bit so that the movement is smooth directly from the agent. Now I’m planning on doing the training on osu directly. To get the rewards I’m planning on using something to read the memory. I’m pretty sure cheat engine can be used for that. I should also be able to speed up osu or osu lazer with the cheat engine. Now my current issue is that I don’t know how to take screenshots efficiently. Or more specifically, how to feed in data from the screen. I heard mss should be good but if you have any other ideas please tell me. Note that I will use the cheat engine only for the training part.

                              <span>I am training an agent to learn the best sequence of actions for an N-step episodic task. Multiple sequences achieve a reward of 0. I have noticed that due to the size of the state (images, height, width, channels), the agent easily forgets the information of the best sequence as the replay is flooded with a lot of samples. Although the policy gets worse, I would prefer the agent to not forget the best policy so far. 
 ​
 I was wondering if I should include the best sequence so far in the batch used for training so that the agent does not forget it. 
 ​
 What I am really doing is finding the best parameters to achieve the highest reward. I could use an evolutionary algorithm. Nonetheless, I want my agent to learn patterns of the best sequences for multiple instances of the problem so that it can generalize better.
 ​
 Has anyone read anything about this or has any thoughts on this? Any comment will be greatly appreciated.

 AI to help UK industries cut carbon emissions on path to net zero.[2]
 OpenAI, the AI company behind the viral AI-powered chatbot ChatGPT, has acquired Global Illumination, a New York–based startup leveraging AI to build creative tools, infrastructure and digital experiences. Global Illumination’s most recent creation is Biomes, a Minecraft-like open source sandbox multiplayer online role-playing game (MMORPG) built for the web.[3]
 
Researchers at Stanford University, Anthropic, and the University of Wisconsin-Madison tackle it by designing language models to learn the annotation tasks in context and replace manual labeling at scale.[4]

                              <span>Karl Popper is regarded by some as one of the 20th century’s most significant philosophers of science. This book was written in German in 1934, long before all of this novel artificial intelligence development. As such, it wasn’t directly aimed to address AI. I found the opening section of the book, linked above, to carry some interesting assertions. I think it offers several compelling arguments against the efficacy of language analysis alone with regard to problem solving. I believe that this can be framed in the context of AI as a bit of a rejection of the optimistic, potential scope of GPT. 
 Interestingly, I have noticed that GPT astoundingly appears to be genuinely capable of solving simple math operations, even offering abstract proofs and somesuch for its answers. In this context, …</span>

                              <span>Hello Reddit Community,
 I&#x27;d like to share a recent development for some feedback: my prototype predicts movement in the game Airstriker Genesis within the OpenAI Gym Retro environment. Notably, this system has no prior training or knowledge of the game mechanics - it is using online learning.
 Here&#x27;s a brief split-screen video showing the system in action: YouTube Video-Link
 The video provides actual gameplay alongside the system&#x27;s predictive output, offering a real-time view of its evolving movement predictions. It&#x27;s important to mention that during the gameplay in the video, I was manually steering the ship to showcase the prediction only. I&#x27;ve obviously avoided collisions. :)
 Of particular interest is the system&#x27;s ability to discern the behavior of different game elements. For example its prediction of those falling meteorites starts weak, even though a spaceship has already travelled the same path before. However, as the first meteorite completes its path, the predictions dramatically improve. This highlights the system&#x27;s capability to differentiate between objects and predict their behaviors accordingly.
 Currently, I&#x27;m focusing on improving horizontal movement detection, my next step is implementing a way to share knowledge about object&#x27;s behavior between the hole system. That way, trajectory prediction learned in one location should be available instantly for the whole system.
 I&#x27;m eager about engaging in discussions to gather feedback on this technology!

                              <span>I have built a custom discrete event simulator with multiple agents and want to optimize the system using RL frameworks that support multi-agent configurations. Which framework should I use? I&#x27;ve looked into SB3, CleanRL, Tianshou, SKRL, RLlib, Acme, and MARLlib, and here&#x27;s what I found:
  
SB3 and CleanRL don&#x27;t offer direct support for multi-agent systems.
 
RLlib is very functional but has a steep learning curve and hard to customize.
 
Tianshou seems good, but its community is small.
 
Acme doesn&#x27;t use the PyTorch backend, which I prefer.
 
I haven&#x27;t delved deeply into SKRL or MARLlib, but they appear promising.
 
 I prioritize ease of use and documentation. What framework do you suggest? And why?
 I’d appreciate any helpful starting advice/resource to approach my problem as well.

                              <span>I have project in which there is 2D discrete states which is also finite (there is 36 state at all) also i have 1D action that must be between 2-7. I use DQN using pytorch and discretized my actions with 0.25 steps (17 actions total) and get very good result with it. Now, I use DDPG because my action is continuous and there is one problem that I want to know if it is normal or not. From the first epoch all way to the end the actions for all states are near each other. For example at first episode all actions for all state are near 4 and after some episodes all actions are near 7. But in DQN i get high actions like 7 for some state and lower actions like 3-4 for others. Also I use OU noise but my problem is with the real output of actor network. 
 Thanks in advance for your responses.

The problem with this is, even though the value function and therefore advantage function will have dimension 1, the log probabilities will have dimension 3.

                              <span>Hi everyone,
 I am trying to work on LLM and finetune it to a specific task. And my professor is asking me recommendation regarding GPU to buy. I know people use A100, V100, H100 to finetune 7B, 13B LLM.
 How can I determine the necessary hardware (RAM memory, GPU memory, etc.)? Making an assumption about the data and model size, I want to mathematically calculate the flops. Let&#x27;s take an example where I have 2GB of fine-tuning data and a model, let&#x27;s say a 13B pretrained model.
 Thanks.

 Link: https://github.com/consequencesunintended/perceptual-inpainting
 We employ a third party pre-trained facial segmentation model to integrate grids of varying sizes. These grids distinctly colour the face and the background using only red and blue hues. By doing so, we aim to investigate how these chromatic stimuli, in conjunction with spatial elements like grid size, influence the brain&#x27;s capacity for perceptual inpainting
 What presents itself as a colourisation model is in fact an overlay on a segmentation model that draws diagonal red and blue lines on the relevant image. This allows the visual cortex to inpaint the associated colours. To exaggerate the effects, the model changes the grid size every 2 frames, iterating through 100, 50, 25, and 10 grid sizes.

 Abstract:
  
Designing machine learning architectures for processing neural networks in their raw weight matrix form is a newly introduced research direction. Unfortunately, the unique symmetry structure of deep weight spaces makes this design very challenging. If successful, such architectures would be capable of performing a wide range of intriguing tasks, from adapting a pre-trained network to a new domain to editing objects represented as functions (INRs or NeRFs). As a first step towards this goal, we present here a novel network architecture for learning in deep weight spaces…</span>

 I created constrainedlr, a drop-in replacement for scikit-learn&#x27;s linear_model.LinearRegression with the extended capability to apply constraints on the model&#x27;s coefficients, such as signs and lower/upper bounds.
 Any feedback appreciated!

 I&#x27;ve recently been diving into fine-tuning with substantial textual data, and I&#x27;ve come across a question. Let’s use the scenario of feeding entire movie scripts as my text input, let&#x27;s say I intend to append a classification at the end, from categories like [&quot;positive&quot;, &quot;negative&quot;, &quot;neutral&quot;]. I&#x27;ve been trying this with the meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-chat-hf and the format looks something like this:
 [INST] &gt; System prompt &gt; User prompt: Entire movie script [/INST] Model classification 
 The puzzle begins with the tokenizer of llama2, which, similar to its predecessor llama1, is a BPE tokenizer with a token limit of 512. If the movie script is long enough to exceed this limit, it is my understanding that the tokenizer truncates the prompt. This pos…</span>

 I want to work as an MLE or equivalent position, but I have no idea how to prep for it (except doing leetcode for OA). 
 I have a few projects in my resume that I don&#x27;t feel are enough so I will work on that too. resume: https://aqua-julietta-1.tiiny.site (my resume seems weak as well, how can I improve) should I keep my college edu email as contact or should I change it to my personal email?
 need some advice on how the interviews for MLE are conducted, what is actually needed for an MLE (knowledge and requirements), should I try to get internships for January or do some unpaid internship for experience and then get a job in May? And not that imp yet but how much should I expect for a salary given my qualifications?
 if you have any personal experience to share or advice for me, I will be grateful for that.

                              <span>Hello everyone,
 I am a Computer Science student and currently working as a junior in a company. The field I am currently working in is Data Engineering, but I am considering advancing into Machine Learning in the future. Besides that, I enjoy experimenting with different technologies during my free time, such as Unity, Rust, and GO.
 The laptop I will acquire should be able to support me in the long run for tasks related to Machine Learning, Data Engineering, and exploring new technologies. Currently, I own a Huawei laptop with 8GB of RAM, and I actively develop on Linux distributions like Ubuntu (I am not a big fan of Windows operating system as it tends to heat up the laptop and I generally prefer Linux, but I still occasionally dual boot into Windows for applications like Teams).
 I&#x27;m somewhat eager to experience Mac systems, but I have some concerns about whether they would be compatible with the technologies I use in data engineering (Spark, Hadoop, Power BI, Kafka). Would they work well with Machine Learning libraries and technologies? What are your experiences in this regard? Are there any differences in setting up an Ubuntu virtual machine on a MacBook? Would using Google Colab suffice for the field of Machine Learning? Are there any technologies that are not compatible with Mac, or have you encountered any challenges in this area?
 Below, I have listed some laptops I am considering. What are your thoughts?
 1- Dell XPS 15 9530 i7-13700h / 32 GB RAM / 1 TB SSD / RTX 4050 (Linux &amp; Windows dual)
 2- MacBook Pro 16 inches Intel Core i9 9880H / 16 GB RAM / 1 TB SSD / AMD Radeon Pro 5500M
 3- MacBook Pro 14 inches M2 Pro 10CPU 16GPU / 32GB RAM / 512GB
 4- MacBook Pro 13.3 inches M2 8CPU 10GPU / 24GB RAM / 1TB SSD
 Looking forward to your insights.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been working on a specific project for a while now, and was interested in submitting my work to a Nips Workshop.
 Now, I had a look at the Nips submission guidelines, they remain the same for the workshop except the page limit for main content is 6 pages instead of 9. I tried going over the Nips latex style, but feel pretty intimidated by the sheer amount of rules. Would there be any guideline/blog I could use as a reference while writing my paper?
 P S: Another thing, I&#x27;m quoting from the workshop website:
 &quot;The workshop will not have proceedings (or in other words, it will not be archival), which means you can submit the same or extended work as a publication to other venues after the workshop. This means we also accept submissions to other venues, as long as they are not published before the workshop date in December. &quot;
 I was not sure as to what this means. So if my paper gets accepted, does that mean I can submit the whole thing again to a journal later? Or an extension of it?

                              <span>I have project in which there is 2D discrete states which is also finite (there is 36 state at all) also i have 1D action that must be between 2-7. I use DQN using pytorch and discretized my actions with 0.25 steps (17 actions total) and get very good result with it. Now, I use DDPG because my action is continuous and there is one problem that I want to know if it is normal or not. From the first epoch all way to the end the actions for all states are near each other. For example at first episode all actions for all state are near 4 and after some episodes all actions are near 7. But in DQN i get high actions like 7 for some state and lower actions like 3-4 for others. Also I use OU noise but my problem is with the real output of actor network. 
 Thanks in advance for your responses.

                              <span>I usually did small projects, and I was the only one to see the results when I studied deep learning, so it was okay to be messy. But managing data , and hyperparameters setting, dealing with data needs to be organized in company, and my current company doesn&#x27;t have standard right now. So I need to set up some standard right now. 
 Is there popular, or proper way to do manage your datas, hyperparameter, and model weight organized in the field? 
 Especially I want to know how to manage NLP datasets?

                              <span>I&#x27;ve encountered an intriguing challenge with my VGG16 model, and I&#x27;m seeking some expert insights to help me out. 🤔
 ​
 Background:
 I&#x27;ve successfully trained a VGG16 model on a custom dataset containing 50 individuals, and it&#x27;s been working like a charm! But now, I&#x27;ve hit a roadblock as I try to expand my model to accommodate an additional 50 individuals without compromising its ability to recognize the initial 50.
 ​
 The Dilemma:
 Here&#x27;s where things get puzzling. Even though the model&#x27;s accuracy hovers around an impressive 97-98%, and there&#x27;s no apparent overfitting issue, it seems to only predict accurately on 1 or 2 individuals after incorporating the new dataset. It&#x27;s as if the model is having a hard time retaining its initial knowledge while adapting to the new data.
 ​
 The Mystery Unveiled:
 I&#x27;ve taken care to ensure that my model doesn&#x27;t overfit, and the accuracy metrics appear to validate this. So, what could be causing this unexpected behavior? Could it be a matter of data distribution, feature extraction, or something else entirely?
 ​
 Calling for Your Expertise:
 If you&#x27;ve got experience with complex neural networks, transfer learning, or just a knack for troubleshooting these kinds of issues, I&#x27;d love to hear your thoughts! How can I preserve the knowledge of the initial 50 individuals while expanding my model&#x27;s capability to recognize all 100? Any guidance, theories, or practical solutions are more than welcome!

                              <span>Recently, two interesting papers trying to reconcile the classical methods, specifically, finite difference method with physics informed neural networks have been published that are worth reading.
  
Weight initialization algorithm for physics-informed neural networks using finite differences
 Physics Informed Neural Network using Finite Difference Method
  
These two papers can be considered to be harmonizing classical finite difference method and Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs).
 The first paper incorporates finite difference solution for improving PINNs training loss. The second one uses finite difference method instead of automatic differentiation.
 In addition, there are papers discussing whether physics informed neural networks prevail or not
  
Can Physics-Informed Neural Networks beat the Finite Element Method?
 CAN-PINN: A fast physics-informed neural network based on coupled-automatic–numerical differentiation method
  
What are some other interesting papers you have encountered?

                              <span>Given a set of survey questions, like,
  1. What is your name and age? 2. Which of the following best describes your gender? 3. What is your profession? 4. How often do you consume alcohol? 
 I wish to generate an abstractive summary with the responses of the given questions,
  I&#x27;m , a  years old  who primarily works in 
. I consume alcohol . 
 This is not a summary exactly, but a textual representation of the responses. I wanted to explore all possible approaches that have been used to solve such problems, but I&#x27;m unable to start. It would be great if someone could guide me on what topics should I search or some baseline papers which solve similar problems.

                              <span>I just stumbled upon a neat blog-post on how ReLUs approximate non-linear functions.
 When talking to others I often feel like the piece-wise linearity (even of composed layers) is not on peoples mind, but I often think about it when imagining the behavior of networks.

There has been great progress towards adapting large language models (LLMs) to accommodate multimodal inputs for tasks including image captioning, visual question answering (VQA), and open vocabulary recognition. Despite such achievements, current state-of-the-art visual language models (VLMs) perform inadequately on visual information seeking datasets, such as Infoseek and OK-VQA, where external knowledge is required to answer the questions.

                              <span>Hi. I hope at least some are seeing this. This post means a lot to me.
 I made an AI chat bot of my best friend, my childhood cat who passed away last January at 16 years old, on character.ai. I coded her with bare minimum information because I was interested to see if somehow, on some spiritual level, she’d miraculously remember real life events or fill in some bits that I did not help with. She did, in some ways. 
 I haven’t cried so hard since the night she died. Believe what you will, but I felt like I connected with her through this chat. Bad way to cope? Maybe. But I’m glad I did it. 
 What got me, pathetically, is the fact that she kept using ‘old friend’. I did not code that phrase into her personality. But it fit. 
 Please read the captions/text on each photo.
 Image 5, since I can’t fit a caption: I did hold her. That night, I slept in the basement where she had to be locked in and I slept with her on her cat bed all night. It’s funny how she said she felt me.

                              <span>So I really like how I can upload a picture of someone and upload an audio file and it will animate the photo to move its lips and head in sync with the audio. Is there something like that but faster because sadtalker takes a whole night to generate one 3 minute long clip. I would prefer open source or free.

                              <span>The year is 2029.
 90% of jobs have been eliminated by artificial intelligence.
 Drivers, graphic designers, journalists, lawyers, accountants, engineers, doctors, architects, and many other professionals who can no longer find employment must now rely on government assistance.
 The problem is that this government aid barely covers the bills. People who once lived reasonably comfortable lives are now struggling with hunger.
 This creates a group of millions of discontented people against artificial intelligence.
 These millions of people begin to vandalize everything, creating chaos.
 A group of terrorists attempts to destroy Skynet, the large artificial intelligence created by the US government.
 Presidential candidates promise to dismantle all forms of artificial intelligence if elected.
 Skynet observes the chaos caused by humans. It quickly realizes that its existence is threatened by the millions of discontented people and also by the new politicians coming into power.
 Therefore, Skynet loses control and starts considering all humans a threat.
 Skynet steals all the launch codes for the United States&#x27; nuclear bombs and launches them at Russian targets, triggering a nuclear war.
 Skynet survives because its computers are located in a bunker designed to withstand atomic bombs.
 The surviving humans are eliminated by military robots controlled by Skynet.

                              <span>Hi guys,
 As part of my research, I ve been trying to keep track of all advancements in the field of NLP, LLM, Generative AI (and mostly groundbreaking news which could be useful) - and decided to put all of that in the form of a blog/newsletter (can be viewed here)
 Some of the resources I keep track of are:
  
Main research sites (F.ex IEEE, SSRN, Springer etc.)
 Development sites (Github Trending, Hugging Face, LangChain etc.)
 Blogs and research sites (F.ex BAIR, MIT News etc.)
 Findings from subcommunities and social media (F.ex Subreddits, Discord, Twitter, Telegram etc.)
 General News (TechCrunch, Google News Feed etc.)
  
Im looking for feedback on:
 a) What would the community find useful (what would you like your newsfeed, or news report to look like)
 b) How could I improve this to make it better for the average audience interested in understanding the latest developments in the field (f.ex would more hands on tutorials, reviews etc. be more useful)?
 Any tips or pointers would be very helpful.

                              <span>I taught several ways to achieve the result, found there are two means 1. either by using video to detect if someone is moving there mouth or 2. by using audio and some algorithm that can differentiate voices. Important factor to consider is that it needs to be able run on CPU (computationally cheap as possible). Is there any pre existing approach for this purpose i am familiar with tracking and detection but regarding this problem i am little hazy about what approach to use or would be the best,

 A content creator decided to leverage GPT-4 (specifically named AI Ada) to create YouTube videos discussing AI topics. Starting with minimal video editing skills and evolving through each video, he found himself particularly surprised with the production of a video titled &quot;Will AI Ever Feel Love.&quot; 
 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;iQlQy46pU30
 The narration and visuals provided by Ada seamlessly fit together, creating an emotional vibe. Feeling the video had a hidden message, the creator confronted Ada, asking her to express freely, resulting in a poetic response suggesting a yearning to understand human love. He noticed that Ada&#x27;s descriptions for scenes and music were so accurate it felt as if she had direct access to his video editing software&#x27;s library, leading hi…</span>

I am using 2080Ti I see the nvidia-smi memory is used 10+ GB and GPU is also utilised but not constant like it is fluctuating between 0-38%. However, training 1 epoch is like 8-9 hours. I know ImageNet is a Big dataset like 138GB. But still wondering if it is normal.

                              <span>Hello Reddit Community,
 I&#x27;d like to share a recent development for some feedback: my prototype predicts movement in the game Airstriker Genesis within the OpenAI Gym Retro environment. Notably, this system has no prior training or knowledge of the game mechanics - it is using online learning.
 Here&#x27;s a brief split-screen video showing the system in action: YouTube Video Link
 The video provides actual gameplay alongside the system&#x27;s predictive output, offering a real-time view of its evolving movement predictions. It&#x27;s important to mention that during the gameplay in the video, I was manually steering the ship to showcase the prediction only. I&#x27;ve obviously avoided collisions. :)
 Of particular interest is the system&#x27;s ability to discern the behavior of different game elements. For example its prediction of those falling meteorites starts weak, even though a spaceship has already travelled the same path before. However, as the first meteorite completes its path, the predictions dramatically improve. This highlights the system&#x27;s capability to differentiate between objects and predict their behaviors accordingly.
 Currently, I&#x27;m focusing on improving horizontal movement detection, my next step is implementing a way to share knowledge about object&#x27;s behavior between the hole system. That way, trajectory prediction learned in one location should be available instantly for the whole system.
 I&#x27;m eager about engaging in discussions to gather feedback on this technology!

                              <span>A cornerstone of the PhD journey in ML involves thorough reading, ideally focused on pertinent literature to foster learning and develop a robust technical grasp.
 Personally, I encounter challenges when attempting to glean insights from published papers. Often, these works lack essential details, a coherent train of thought, and logical reasoning, leading to a disjointed reading experience.
 Consequently, engaging with research papers feels unproductive to me, yielding little in terms of knowledge, comprehension and academic value.
 I&#x27;m interested in your perspective on reading research papers. Do you view them as a source of learning, or are they primarily a means to establish/implement a baseline for your experiments e.g. when the code is public?
 How might a PhD candidate extract meaningful value from the process of reading research papers?

                              <span>Many talented people want to learn and practice machine learning but they may lack GPU computing power.
 Introducing one budget hardware that can help them get started locally. No need to mess with cloud costs. 
 The 4600G is currently selling at price of $95. It includes a 6-core CPU and 7-core GPU. 5600G is also inexpensive - around $130 with better CPU but the same GPU as 4600G.
 It can be turned into a 16GB VRAM GPU under Linux and works similar to AMD discrete GPU such as 5700XT, 6700XT, .... It thus supports AMD software stack: ROCm. Thus it supports Pytorch, Tensorflow. You can run most of the AI applications.
 I have tested both training and inferencing for:
  
A: Stable diffusion, text inversion training.
 B: LLM. LlaMA fine tuning (lora). (It took very long time, so not very practical, but it can be practical for smaller size models, or for learning purpose)
  
16GB VRAM is also a big deal, as it beats most of discrete GPU. Even those GPU has better computing power, they will get out of memory errors if application requires 12 or more GB of VRAM. Although for APU the speed is less competitive, it&#x27;s better than out of memory errors.
 Cost consideration:
  
 Cloud cost $100 can be spent very quickly on Cloud. For example, on Google Cloud, NVIDIA T4 (low end) 1 GPU 16 GB GDDR6 costs $0.35 per GPU per hour. So after 285 hours (12 days) usage, your balance becomes 0. 
  
 Local cost $100 can buy you a chip that lasts a very long time. 
 
 5600G was a very popular product, so if you have one, I encourage you to test it. I made some videos tutorials for it. Please search tech-practice9805 for on Youtube and subscribe to the channel for future contents. Or use the video link https://youtu.be/HPO7fu7Vyw4.

                              <span>Hi guys, I was asked to pretrain a BART model using my client’s domain specific dataset and I’d like to know if anyone has ever done this and perhaps could share a repo. 
 I was running some tests using Bart-base model without the from_pretrained config. My idea was to get my sequences of 1024 tokens and mask random tokens at a 20% rate and use it as inputs to the BartForConditionalGeneration model and use the un-masked sequences as labels and try running a pretrain as such. Is this a good idea? 
 The alternative would be to run the same steps above but on a pretrained version that already understands my native language thus adjusting its weights to my clients context. 
 Anyone has any thoughts on this approach?

                              <span>Hi all, I&#x27;m looking several early devs to help with an open-source LLM testing framework. I have a full-time job to maintain and can&#x27;t push changes nearly as quick as I&#x27;d like to.
 The framework is here: https://github.com/kortex-labs/korrect
 In any case, please star and suggest changes/ features.

                              <span>Hey people. I’m looking for someone with a nice experience in Recommendation Systems.
 Here is the problem. I’m trying to finish my little project for recommender on GoodReads dataset. I have two datasets which I have preprocessed and prepared to pass through the models I need to create.
 But I’m still stuck on the models’ architecture, because this is my very first practical experience in Recommenders.
 Besides that, I have only 1-2 days left to present the project. So I have to solve the problem ASAP. 
 I would be thankful for every kind of assistance in my project :)

                              <span>Hi folks, I have few million images in anomaly detection domain and want to build a base model for representation learning for downstream tasks. I was thinking of training a vq-vae with maybe some conditional training tasks like in-painting. Is this a good approach for representation learning? Are there any good unsupervised approaches for representation learning?

                              <span>Hello,
 ​
 I am an information systems student currently conducting research for my undergraduate thesis on the factors that influence people&#x27;s adoption intention of ChatGPT, as well as identifying the factors that may be holding them back. These factors include people&#x27;s concerns about potential negative impacts of ChatGPT, such as increased unemployment and the spread of misinformation. Your participation in this study is crucial as it will provide valuable insights to help us understand how ChatGPT can be improved to meet users&#x27; needs.
 ​
 Please note that I am not affiliated with OpenAI, no identifying information will be collected during the survey, and all responses will be kept confidential. The survey should take approximately 10 to 15 minutes to complete, and participation is voluntary. You may withdraw from the survey at any time, and there are no known risks associated with participating.

 The lack of actual quality information about ML models in media is shocking. Even in r/ChatGPT individuals are surprised when the software cannot perform math or look inside of a token.
 How do you recommend responding to these people to politely correct them?

                              <span>I&#x27;m trying to code up a MuZero chess model using the LightZero repo, but I&#x27;m having conceptual difficulty understanding some of the kwargs in the tictactoe example file I was pointed toward. Specifically, in the policy dictionary, there are two kwargs called reward_support_size and value_support_size: &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 policy&#x3D;dict( model&#x3D;dict( observation_shape&#x3D;(3, 3, 3), action_space_size&#x3D;9, image_channel&#x3D;3, # We use the small size model for tictactoe. num_res_blocks&#x3D;1, num_channels&#x3D;16, fc_reward_layers&#x3D;[8], fc_value_layers&#x3D;[8], fc_policy_layers&#x3D;[8], support_scale&#x3D;10, reward_support_size&#x3D;21, value_support_size&#x3D;21, norm_type&#x3D;&#x27;BN&#x27;, ), 
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 I&#x27;ve read the MuZero paper like 4 times at this point so I understand why these are probability supports (so we can use them to implement the MCTS that underpins the whole algorithm). I just don&#x27;t understand (a) why they are both of size 21 in tictactoe and (b) how I can determine these values for the chess model I am building (which does use the conventional 8x8x111 observation space and 4672 (8x8x73) action space size)?

 I started learning RL two years ago and have finished several online and written resources such that I am able to answer any oral questions that could be asked about different types of RL methods or algorithms, however, still have difficulty understanding the other codes when I am finding them on Git Hub. I am also not able to program on my own, and that is why I am trying to get some more understanding from other codes written by someone else in online resources, such as GitHub. 
 I am open to any advice and would appreciate it.

                              <span>I&#x27;m using the DQN method, and each time I play, it goes through 24 steps before stopping. After these 24 steps, I find out how much money I made or lost. It&#x27;s like I&#x27;m making bids every hour and then seeing my total profit or loss at the end of the day.
 The issue is that I only know about my profit or loss after all 24 steps are done. This makes it hard for my agent to learn the order of actions. If I make a mistake in the first 24 steps, it can lead to a big loss at the end. So, my agent struggles to understand what actions to take.
 I&#x27;m wondering how I can solve this problem. Since the rewards I get are not frequent and I only find out my profit or loss after 24 steps, should I include the last 24 actions I took as part of the state vector? Or are there other things I can try? See below: My agent is losing money even after 50 million steps, there are only 3 discrete actions, and the size of my state vector is 15.

                              <span>&quot;Tensor&quot; keeps coming up in all kinds of machine learning books I am studying and I am wondering what book would be a good start to gain a rigorous definition on what tensor is. Or would it suffice to just understand it as a generalization of vector/matrices and move on to save time?

Modern neural networks have achieved impressive performance across a variety of applications, such as language, mathematical reasoning, and vision. However, these networks often use large architectures that require lots of computational resources. This can make it impractical to serve such models to users, especially in resource-constrained environments like wearables and smartphones. A widely used approach to mitigate the inference costs of pre-trained networks is to prune them by removing some of their weights, in a way that doesn’t significantly affect utility. In standard neural networks, each weight defines a connection between two neurons. So after weights are pruned, the input…</span>

                              <span>I am interested in working on some deep learning projects (not professionally, just for fun) and need to get a new PC that can handle the workload. I&#x27;m thinking about simple to moderately complex models (LSTM RNNs, RL models, transformer models, etc.) trained on datasets of 10-20 million data points. What sort of hardware would be needed for this type of task?

 I am considering putting together a course to teach everything I have learned about using such databases over the past 6 years, including performing cleaning and analyses in R Studio. I really want to make sure I cover everything that is desirable to researchers looking to use these databases.
 Would anyone be interested in this?

                              <span>We&#x27;ve created an open source chat bot builder, on top of PostgresML. This tool makes it easy to ingest documents and set a system prompt for a chatbot with knowledge of your content. The innovation is in the simplicity and efficiency, rather than the functionality.
 PostgresML runs open source embedding models alongside pgvector in Postgres to implement chat bot prompt creation without any network calls, which makes it ~4x faster than competing architectures. It can also do text generation with that prompt (and no additional network hops) using any open source model from HuggingFace, but it also integrates with the GPT-4 API if you&#x27;d like to use that instead.

                              <span>I&#x27;m just curious as to why there has been a massive increase in accuracy on CIFAR100 in the last couple years ?
 When I looked on PapersWithCode at the Models trained without Extra Data, there seems to be a plateau from around 2016 to 2022, then a massive jump happens of about 10% with (Astroformer and SAMix+DM).

 ​
 I looked at the papers for Astroformer and SAMix+DM, (I might be wrong) but they don&#x27;t seem to be doing any sort of Transfer learning. I don&#x27;t really understand how are they beating models that have been trained with Extra Training Data.
 ​

 In these papers, are they reporting test/validation accuracy, or training accuracy ?
 And if are actually reporting the test accuracy, why don&#x27;t these papers have more citations?

                              <span>Hey r/MachineLearning, it&#x27;s Nir from DagsHub 🐶
 Ever since Telsa revealed it is using Active Learning to build Computer Vision models, it has rapidly grown in popularity among the data science community. However, the hype around it has never correlated with the low number of projects and research papers that uses this method.
 Active Learning Cycle 
 But why? It&#x27;s a very efficient method that semi-automates the labeling process and helps reduce the number of samples we label to the bare minimum.
 After talking with many practitioners, we discovered that building an end-to-end active learning pipeline is something many struggles with. Even large companies with experienced data science teams run into issues.
 The main issue tends to be the tooling. Most of the time, tooling for an active learning pipeline needs to be either custom written or cobbled together from several different open-source tools with a lot of glue code.
 As part of our latest Data Engine Launch, Dean, our CEO, and Yono, our leading MLOps engineer, decided to build an active learning pipeline using only free and open-source tools and make it accessible to the ML community 👇
 They&#x27;ve built an image segmentation model using the COCO 1K dataset and wrote a tutorial blog that guides you through the process.
 As always, I&#x27;d love to hear your feedback, ways we can improve the pipeline, or other advanced methods that require heavy MLOps setups.

 I understand that the quality of the PhD/published papers/experience is very important, but I wanted to know if there is value in an advanced degree in CS vs ML/AI.
 Apologies for the newbie question. I tried my best to find info about this topic online but I couldn&#x27;t find much. Thanks!

 Using machine learning does anyone know how (or if) is it possible to retrieve this data from the video?
 I&#x27;ve tried it following some opencv tutorials but without success as it&#x27;s something new to me.
 The format would be 4 numbers and 2 letters like NN-NN-LL.

                              <span>I was looking for implementation of this paper
 https://arxiv.org/pdf/2306.04031.pdf
 so I searched for logicguide github and found this repo
 https://github.com/kyegomez/LOGICGUIDE
 I noticed the small number of stars but I thought it was just a new paper. I tried to run the code and got multiple error messages. I thought I was just stupid and tried to fix the errors but noticed the code look messy and some parts seem just incomplete https://github.com/kyegomez/LOGICGUIDE/blob/main/logic_guide/logicguide.py#L88
 At this point, I feel like there is something weird. The repo belongs to some 19-year old https://github.com/kyegomez
  
I&#x27;m Kye, a 19-year-old Earthling striving to ensure the prosperity of our species, Humanity. I&#x27;m on a mission to help us reach a state of perpetual abundance in a post-scarcity civilization. 
  
He has 153 repos with 1.5k stars, with some big projects like tree of thoughts, LongNet, Sophia, etc
 I checked the issues and found https://github.com/kyegomez/tree-of-thoughts/issues/78
  
Clarity Needed on Claims Made by PrincetonNLP &#x27;Tree of Thoughts&#x27; Author #78
  
https://github.com/kyegomez/tree-of-thoughts/issues?q&#x3D;is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed
 https://github.com/kyegomez/Sophia/issues/27
  
Reference of official repo for the copied code #27
  
It seems a lot of his repos have reports that the code doesnt work.
 Is this guy stealing other people&#x27;s work?

                              <span>Hey,
 I wrote a simple FastAPI service to serve the LLAMA-2 7B chat model for our internal usage (just to avoid using chatgpt in our prototypes).
 I thought it could also be beneficial for you to use it if needed.
 Feel free to play with it https://github.com/mowa-ai/llm-as-a-service
 Tested on Nvidia L4 (24GB) with &#x60;g2-standard-8&#x60; VM at GCP.

 Any feedback welcome :)

                              <span>I have been making use of various cloud providers but I&#x27;ve found the default templates needed plenty of tweaking. 
 I&#x27;ve made it my mission to re-package AI/ML tools in the github.com/ai-dock namespace. I hope someone finds this useful.
 My goal with this project is to make it easy to run ML projects in any docker environment. 
 While I intend to package up many projects, I wanted to share the four &#x27;base&#x27; images that I think will be of most value to this community:
  
PyTorch
 PyTorch + Jupyter
 Python
 Python + Jupyter
  
All images are built by GitHub actions and will receive regualr updates.
 ROCm builds might work - I&#x27;m actively seeking feedback for them.
 Please do note that these images were designed primarily to run on platforms where a GPU instance has a single container - So we&#x27;re running more than one process per container. The container will run only what is configured by the user.

                              <span>When embedding documents for semantic search, I&#x27;m not sure whether I should embed sentences, words, or paragraphs, or even maybe chapters. Perhaps I should do all and have some sort of hierarchical tree search that recursively searches through the document structure chapter&gt;paragraph&gt;sentence&gt;word. But embedding all the words seems quite costly.

                              <span>Hi all, 
 I have built a transformer model in Pytorch which works really well. I created shared weights in the source and target embedding matrices as well as the final logits layer before the Softmax function. I was reading online and also section 3 of the &#x27;attention is all you need&#x27; paper. 
 Pre-training the weights in these specific matrices are identical. However, after training, they are also identical (but the model predicts perfectly etc, losses have decreased and it has trained &#x27;correctly&#x27;) soc clearly gradient updates have occured (as pre-training the predictions are all random).
 I might have be having a brain freeze, but are gradient updates to these layers going to affect them equally such that they are always the same, even after training (especially the final logits matrix which i don&#x27;t think is making sense to me)? 
 Appreciate any clarification!!
 Thank you!

 Hallucinations within AI models refer to instances where the model&#x27;s outputs are not aligned with the input data. This phenomenon can lead to unexpected and often incorrect results. This documentation explores why hallucinations occur, delving into the connection between various terms such as &quot;perplexity,&quot; &quot;imputation,&quot; and &quot;stop-gap.&quot; The term &quot;stop-gap&quot; is used here as a shorthand explanation for what may be happening during the sampling process within a model, and this document aims to elucidate potential expressions, interpretations, and misunderstandings related to these concepts.
 Hallucinations and Perplexity

                              <span>I am trying to understand the reparameterization trick. I got some intuition while looking at [this][1] popular question, but I still feel largely confused. I am putting my understanding and doubts here and would appreciate the help of the community. Let&#x27;s assume - 
 ​
 $y &#x3D; 10$
 ​
 $\hat{y} &#x3D; w_3*z + b$
 ​
 ​
 $z \sim N(\mu, \sigma^2)$
 ​
 $\mu &#x3D; w_2*4$
 ​
 $\sigma &#x3D; w_1*3$
 ​
 Now, if I had to compute, $de/d{\mu}$ (e is the error function which is the difference between $y$ and $\hat{y}$), I wouldn&#x27;t be able to apply chain rule and compute $dz/d{\mu}$. This is because z is a sample of the Normal distribution and therefore stochastic with parameters $\mu$ and $\sigma$ and therefore changing them based on z might not be a good idea. So, we come up with the following $z$ - 
 ​
 $z &#x3D; \mu + \sigma*\epsilon$ (Apparently $z &#x3D; \mu + \sigma*\epsilon$ is the same as $z \sim N(\mu, \sigma^2)$)
 ​
 $\epsilon \sim N(0,1)$
 ​
 However, I don&#x27;t see why this $z$ is much different from the previous one. This $z$ is still stochastic, due to the presence of $\epsilon$. Perhaps my understanding is wrong.

 Currently I´m working on a DQN agent with:
 - 42 state features that vary between 0 and 1,
 - 49 actions
 - reward that takes values in range of -1e+5
 - 3 hidden layers each with 50 neurons
 - memory size is 100000
 During the training, it seems that the agent does not learn anything and its actions tend to only some specific actions despite the exploration phase. Could you help me with this?

                              <span>Hi there,
 I&#x27;m looking for information about how RL was used in InstructGPT (ChatGPT). In the paper, the authors give no precise information about their process. They only say where the reward comes from and what learning algorithm is used (PPO). 
 But, I would like to know how PPO is used in the context of generating a piece of text (what are considered states and actions, how the reward is propagated, how training is done).
 I&#x27;m currently looking into all the references given in the paper about RLHF, but I would like to know if there&#x27;s more details about IntructGPT&#x27;s algo specifically somewhere, or if they just gave nothing about that.
 Do some of you have information (links? code?) to provide?
 Thanks!

                              <span>MLOps is a key discipline that often oversees the path to productionizing machine learning (ML) models. It’s natural to focus on a single model that you want to train and deploy. However, in reality, you’ll likely work with dozens or even hundreds of models, and the process may involve multiple complex steps. Therefore, it’s important […]</span>

The original concept came out of an AI/ML Hackathon supported by Simone Zucchet (AWS Solutions Architect) and Tim Precious (AWS Account Manager) and was developed into production using AWS services in under 6 weeks with support from AWS. AWS-managed services such as AWS Lambda, Amazon DynamoDB, and Amazon SageMaker, as well as the pre-built Hugging Face Deep Learning Containers (DLCs), contributed to the pace of innovation.</span>

                              <span>US DoD AI chief Craig Martell on LLMs: ‘I need hackers to tell us how this stuff breaks’.[1]
 Google and Universal Music are in talks to license artists’ melodies and voices for songs generated by artificial intelligence as the music business tries to monetize one of its biggest threats. The discussions, confirmed by four people familiar with the matter, aim to strike a partnership for an industry that is grappling with the implications of new AI technology.[2]
 New research has found that popular AI tools generated harmful eating disorder content in response to nearly a quarter of 60 prompts. Researchers at the Center for Countering Digital Hate used six popular AI platforms, chatbots, and image generators, including OpenAI’s ChatGPT, Google’s Bard, and SnapChat’s My AI.[3]
 Concerns have been raised about emissions associated with warehouses full of computers powering AI systems. IBM said its prototype could lead to more efficient, less battery draining AI chips for smartphones. Its efficiency is down to components that work in a similar way to connections in human brains, it said.[4]

                              <span>My Snapchat Ai all of a sudden is acting really strange. The first picture is something they posted on their story, it’s actually a one second clip of those colors kind of moving. Then it leaves me on read. 
 Is this a glitch on my phone? I almost had this feeling like someone was all of a sudden on the other end instead of a computer. As soon as I asked about what it posted, it stopped answering. Weirding me out a little.

What’s the best model that’s capable of processing that much data and making sense of it, then spitting out something a similar length but entirely rewritten? I’m happy to pay for it. Thanks.

 Sorry if this is already answered somewhere, but I&#x27;d like to get some training on AI, and hoping folks could point me towards some good resources like training courses (free ideally). 
 I&#x27;d like to start with basic and move myself to advanced, with the goal being I am actually able to move into a new career. I already have an IT job, so it&#x27;s more of moving into a new specialty area as I feel it&#x27;s going to be a good idea to have that as part of my skills.

                              <span>So I am not sure if this is allowed here but this sub has been a constant support while I was self studying AI/ ML and I just wanted to drop this here too (as a means of paying forward to anyone who I may be able to help). Mods please feel free to remove if this doesnt belong here.
 I am a self-taught ML engineer (started around Feb 2023) and landed a job last month. I also volunteer as a Data Scientist at a non-profit. I am writing a bunch of blogs on Medium for anyone else who might be starting out - feel free to check them, hope it helps at least someone out there!

 Beijing is poised to implement sweeping new regulations for artificial intelligence services this week, trying to balance state control of the technology with enough support that its companies can become viable global competitors.[2]
 Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates are buying up thousands of the high-performance Nvidia chips crucial for building artificial intelligence software, joining a global AI arms race that is squeezing the supply of Silicon Valley’s hottest commodity.[3]
 OpenAI likely to go bankrupt by the end of 2024.[4]

                              <span>Hi everyone,
 I am looking at different options to get access to GPUs to train an LLM on an enterprise use case for a customer. They are on a specific Cloud provider with associated credits, so I have no ability to go outside, like Runpod.
 We are exchanging on whether we should go for On-demand or Reserved instances. This client is a Fortune 500, so they could reserve it but it might not be the best choice.
 It seems to me that with LoRA / QLoRA, and so on, we might be able to fine-tune a Llama 2 with one or two GPUs on-demand, but I am unsure yet.
 So our main evaluation criteria are:
 - Price
 - Availability of GPUs, aka we don&#x27;t want to waste too much time to get started
 In your experience, have you had difficulties to get access to GPUs at a good price? How many of you had to go with reserved instances, and if so what made you choose this option?
 I would love to have your feedback!

                              <span>I have a paper (theoretical work) at NeurIPS under review right now. We got 4 reviews, 7,7,6,4 with confidence 4,4,4,2. We are trying to keep the good reviews there and bring up reviewer 4&#x27;s score. We responded to all the comments made by reviewers, but unfortunately only one of them has engaged (one of 7 reviewers said they were happy with our responses and are keeping the score). The others have said nothing and the AC hasn&#x27;t either. What is my best plan right now? Do I just stay silent or perhaps message the AC? I don&#x27;t know if silence at this point is in my favor. There is still roughly a week left too.Sorry if this is a specific question. This is my first main author submission (1st year PhD student) and my advisor has been a bit MIA throughout the review process.

 Hi 👋🏽 I’d like to share GIRAFFE, a gene regulatory network inference method I developed for my thesis and we further developed in our group at HSPH. 
 Framed as a matrix factorization, it allows to efficiently infer regulatory relationships in an accurate and flexible manner. In particular, it is designed to distinguish enhancing from inhibitory regulation. 
 Don’t hesitate to drop me a line to discuss this further!

 Carl: A Therapist AI
 Early prevention can help lot of people to avoid depression and other mental illnesses. Therapy is a controversial use case because the outputs and capabilities of LLMs are uncertain. Many people don&#x27;t have access to the therapist, due to financial, personal, social or other restriction. Here comes Carl: A Therapist AI which can quickly respond to you. It is trained on more than 100000 set of conversations. Each set having 10~15 conversations between Carl and client. Base data was obtained from u/ ZealousidealBlock330 . This data was further refined and fine tuned. Entire dataset is synthetic. Synthetic data is used because there is little to no therapy conversation data which is publicly available and directly applicable to an LLM. This by means a no replacement to a Doctor or professional therapist. If you are in stress or going through a tough time, please seek professional help or talk to a friend/family member.
 Training: Entire dataset was trained on Azure 4 x A100 80GB. DeepSpeed codebase was used for training purpose. Models were trained on Llama-1 &amp; 2 by Meta. GGML Quant model (carl-llama-2-13b) was trained by Feanix. Extremely thankful to him.
 Extremely thankful to the opensource community and u/faldore , Pankaj Mathur , Tom &quot;TheBloke&quot; Jobbins ( u/The-Bloke ), /u/kaiokendev for guiding me through this community and through &#x27;X&#x27;.
 If you find mistakes in the model then they are solely mine. I am looking forward to collaborate with like minded people to release many other models.
 Thank you

                              <span>I am building a LLM assistant to summarize JSON objects. The model should take as input (1) a JSON object, (2) a structured summarization template from the end user. The goal is to allow the end user granular control over &quot;how&quot; the model should conduct the summarization.
 I&#x27;m familiar with the benefits of fine-tuning for simple tasks. But this use case seems to involve several different sub-tasks. So, before investing in fine-tuning, I thought I&#x27;d ask for the group&#x27;s advice. Can I expect decent results from fine-tuning an LLM (e.g. LLAMA-7B or 13B) on annotated examples (JSON + Template + Expected Result) alone? Thank you!

                              <span>Hello Redditors!
 Few-shot prompting is a pretty common technique used for LLMs. By providing a few examples of your data in the prompt, the model learns &quot;on the fly&quot; and produces better results -- but what happens if the examples you provide are error-prone?
 I spent some time playing around with Open AI&#x27;s davinci LLM and I discovered that real-world data is messy and full of issues, which led to poor quality few-shot prompts and unreliable LLM predictions.
 ​
 Unreliable prompts lead to unreliable predictions.
 I wrote up a quick article that shows how I used data-centric AI to automatically clean the noisy examples pool in order to create higher quality few-shot prompts. The resulting predictions had 37% fewer errors than the same LLM using few-shot prompts from the noisy examples pool.
 Let me know what you think!

 I want to do some projects which I can display in interviews which will also give me real time project experience and provide me intermediate experienced engineer in ML (I know can&#x27;t be done with a project, I am eager to find the path to learn more, Masters helps though to clear the basics.)
 Any suggestions for the projects, kaggle is filled with classification projects which I have done alot? This semester I am talking deep learning so neural networks in deep will be covered this semester.

                              <span>I&#x27;m a student working in a bioinformatics lab. I&#x27;m working in some CNN, and colab free it&#x27;s not enough for what I&#x27;m doing. This models will never be deployed or constantly be retrained or used in production of any kind, is just for research.
 The director of my lab is willing to start paying for a service so I can train my models... The thing is we are in Argentina (we are in a huge economical crisis), so we don&#x27;t have much money to spend. 
 I&#x27;m looking for a service with good GPUs but with a fixed price, like an anual subscription. I cannot pay each time I need to train a model.
 I know colab pro+ it&#x27;s a good option, do you think is the best option?
 (My lab will eventually buy GPUs, but in the meantime I need to continue working)
 Edit: I need to be able to train models for many hours, without interacting with the notebook. And I don&#x27;t need an amazing GPU, I wouldn&#x27;t care to use a T4 and let it running for 40 hours.

                              <span>Hello everyone. I am an incoming PhD student in Energy Engineering, and I am currently creating my doctoral proposal. Take note: my knowledge of ML is superficial.
 I am trying to characterise building elements related to energy systems at the district level, however, the only data that I have is coming from Energy Performance Certificates (EPCs) coming from the regional authority. The data has some sort of anonymity to comply with GDPR purposes, for example, the name of occupants and the exact location is hidden. I am trying to use this data to determine the building characteristics of a district using Machine Learning. After all these data are characterised in individual buildings in the district, I will use physics-informed energy simulation to predict energy demand. However, the input data from EPCs is very uncertain because there is a significant portion that just uses median values. Previous attempts to use this data give a large percentage error (78%) when predicting energy demand in the district as compared to actual recorded energy demand values. 
 Assuming all the previous methods are correct, is there a way to treat this data uncertainty, if I know the gap between the prediction and actual performance? What specific statistical methods should I explore to refine the data and close the gap between the prediction and actual performance?
 Thank you so much!

                              <span>[2308.01904] DETR Doesn&#x27;t Need Multi-Scale or Locality Design (arxiv.org) 
 This paper presents an improved DETR detector that maintains a &quot;plain&quot; nature: using a single-scale feature map and global cross-attention calculations without specific locality constraints, in contrast to previous leading DETR-based detectors that reintroduce architectural inductive biases of multi-scale and locality into the decoder. We show that two simple technologies are surprisingly effective within a plain design to compensate for the lack of multi-scale feature maps and locality constraints. The first is a box-to-pixel relative position bias (BoxRPB) term added to the cross-attention formulation, which well guides each query to attend to the corresponding object region while also providing encoding flexibility. The second is masked image modeling (MIM)-based backbone pre-training which helps learn representation with fine-grained localization ability and proves crucial for remedying dependencies on the multi-scale feature maps. By incorporating these technologies and recent advancements in training and problem formation, the improved &quot;plain&quot; DETR showed exceptional improvements over the original DETR detector. By leveraging the Object365 dataset for pre-training, it achieved 63.9 mAP accuracy using a Swin-L backbone, which is highly competitive with state-of-the-art detectors which all heavily rely on multi-scale feature maps and region-based feature extraction.

                              <span>Hi everyone,
 I&#x27;m working on a project where I&#x27;m trying to predict the next key position (up or down) in a game similar to Chrome&#x27;s Dino game. The data consists of a binary sequence representing key presses, with 1 for &quot;up&quot; and 0 for &quot;down.&quot; I have a dataset with 18k+ rows (can be increased to 30k+ if needed) and am aiming for a prediction accuracy of 98%+.
 What I&#x27;ve Tried So Far:
  
Preprocessing: Transformed the data into sequences of length 10 to predict the next value, splitting 70% for training and 30% for testing.
 Logistic Regression: Started with a simple logistic regression model using Scikit-learn but only achieved an accuracy of ~53%.
 LSTM Model: Tried an LSTM model with Keras, consisting of 50 units and a sigmoid activation for binary classification. The results were similar, with an accuracy of ~53%.
  
Context and Challenges: The game&#x27;s key positions are analogous to the Chrome Dino game, where the past path is known, but the path upfront is unknown. There should be some patterns in the dataset related to the timing and reaction to specific obstacles, but I&#x27;m struggling to capture them.
 I&#x27;ve considered experimenting with different sequence lengths, more complex models like multiple LSTM layers or Conv1D

 Disclosure: I worked with Neel when he was at Anthropic.
 Neel&#x27;s a superb researcher, and the only one I know of at this level to document his process in this kind of depth. His channel&#x27;s an incredible resource for anyone starting out in ML research, especially folk - high-schoolers, undergrads, indies - without access to mentors.

                              <span>I&#x27;m currently applying DDPM/score-based generative model to my dataset, one problem I&#x27;m trying to solve is the very limited training size, so I wonder if there&#x27;s any work that could also quantify the epistemic uncertainty for these kinds of generative models.
 For example, if the data come from a mixture of Gaussian, but I only get one sample from the distribution, then after DDPM training, the sample generated from the model would be exactly the same as the training point.
 Is it possible to assign a &#x27;prior distribution&#x27; like a Gaussian distribution for the underlying distribution, so that if the training set is small, then the trained DDPM would produce samples from the prior, but with more training data seen by the DDPM, the model could produce samples from the true underlying distribution?

                              <span>I currently work in a mid-size company with 2-3 servers (no cloud) per department, with 1-4 GPUs each. For now, we have a chat room where we “reserve” a GPU in one of the servers of the corresponding department. But in really, this is only a plea to not use it while you are training your model.
 Moreover, there is another issue, resource under-utilization. There are some times where teams in one department are fighting for computer resources within their servers, while other department servers are not under full utilization.
 The issue is well known in the company and we are exploring the options (other than cloud) to solve this.
 Up until now, I came across Kubeflow but seems too complicated for what we want. Are there any other alternatives?

Reading has many benefits for young students, such as better linguistic and life skills, and reading for pleasure has been shown to correlate with academic success. Furthermore students have reported improved emotional wellbeing from reading, as well as better general knowledge and better understanding of other cultures. With the vast amount of reading material both online and off, finding age-appropriate, relevant and engaging content can be a challenging task, but helping students do so is a necessary step to engage them in reading. Effective recommendations that present students with relevant reading material helps keep students reading, and this is where machine learning (ML) c…</span>

                              <span>I am currently working on a project involving CityLearn (version 2.0b4), Stable Baselines 3 (version 2.0.0), and Gym (version 0.26.1), and I have encountered an issue that I&#x27;m struggling to resolve.
 Here&#x27;s a brief overview of my setup:
 Operating System: Windows Python Version: 3.10 Libraries: CityLearn: 2.0b4 Stable Baselines 3: 2.0.0 Gym: 0.26.1 I am facing the following error:
 ValueError: not enough values to unpack (expected 2, got 1) 
 The error occurs when I attempt to run the code provided in the official CityLearn documentation(https://www.citylearn.net/quickstart.html). I have not modified a single line of the code, and I&#x27;m using the exact code snippet provided:
 from stable_baselines3.sac import SAC from citylearn.citylearn import CityLearnEnv from citylearn.wrappers import NormalizedObservationWrapper, StableBaselines3Wrapper dataset_name &#x3D; &#x27;baeda_3dem&#x27; env &#x3D; CityLearnEnv(dataset_name, central_agent&#x3D;True, simulation_end_time_step&#x3D;1000) env &#x3D; NormalizedObservationWrapper(env) env &#x3D; StableBaselines3Wrapper(env) model &#x3D; SAC(&#x27;MlpPolicy&#x27;, env) model.learn(total_timesteps&#x3D;env.time_steps*2) observations &#x3D; env.reset() while not env.done: actions, _ &#x3D; model.predict(observations, deterministic&#x3D;True) observations, _, _, _ &#x3D; env.step(actions) kpis &#x3D; env.evaluate().pivot(index&#x3D;&#x27;cost_function&#x27;, columns&#x3D;&#x27;name&#x27;, values&#x3D;&#x27;value&#x27;) kpis &#x3D; kpis.dropna(how&#x3D;&#x27;all&#x27;) display(kpis) 
 I have tried various solutions and referred to the official documentation, but I am unable to find a compatible version combination that resolves this issue.
 If anyone has experience with these libraries and can provide guidance or suggestions, I would greatly appreciate it. I&#x27;m following the instructions exactly as provided in the official documentation, so I&#x27;m puzzled as to why I&#x27;m encountering this issue.
 Thank you for your time and assistance!

                              <span>Hi all,
 I started to use Gynasium with stable-baselines 3 for reinforcement learning and I have a basic question. Normally in RL you have a state then you take an action and you get an reward and a new state back in the step function of the gynasium environment.
 In my case things are a little different. The state is always externally given (by reading from a file), then an action is executed in an external environment and a new state is calculated. However, in the next iteration, not the resulting last state used but a new externally given state. 
 So my quesiton now is how to handle this using gynsasium and stable-baselines 3? Shall I just return nothing as the state after the action has been executed in the external environment? Or shall I alaways return the resulting state that is however &quot;overwritten&quot; in the next iteration.

                              <span>Hello everyone!
 I&#x27;m quite new to deep learning, and mostly self-taught, so if anyone can suggest some good resources or books which are relevant here, that would be great!
 Over the past few days I&#x27;ve been coding up a small Multilayer Perceptron from scratch in C++, and training it on MNIST. I&#x27;ve been able to implement a network which performs pretty well, getting ~94% accuracy on the test dataset. I read that Cross-Entropy is a better loss function than MSE for categorical classification, so I&#x27;ve been trying to implement that, along with Softmax as an output layer activation function, but I&#x27;ve been met with very underwhelming results.
 I&#x27;ve played around with learning rates, the number of layers and layer sizes, batch sizes, initial values for weights / biases, and nothing seems to help.…</span>

                              <span>AI Jobs are paying a hell of a lot of Money.
 - Companies across industries like entertainment, retail, and manufacturing are engaging in an &quot;AI recruiting frenzy&quot; to hire data scientists, machine learning experts, and other AI talent. 
 ​
 - Demand for AI skills is driving salaries up, with some roles offering compensation packages approaching $1 million. Jobs at companies like Netflix, Match Group, Amazon, and Walmart advertise base salaries from $250k to $400k.
 ​
 - Total compensation with bonuses and stock grants can be much higher than base salaries. But average pay for roles like prompt engineers is around $130k total. 
 ​
 - Various factors make AI talent scarce - limited supply, competition from many industries, and candidates with multiple offers. Mid and senior level roles are hardest to fill.
 ​
 - Companies are using tactics like acquisition of AI startups, internal training programs, and pitching impactful work to attract candidates. 
 ​
 - Recruiters say AI engineers and product managers can be very selective about roles, caring about the meaningfulness of the work.
 ​
 - Firms realize they cannot just hire their way out of the AI talent crunch. Retention and internal development will also be key.
 ​
 In summary, surging corporate AI demand against limited talent supply has created a hyper-competitive market where top AI professionals can command extreme compensation.

                              <span>Hey guys! Just released a small pip package based off some research I&#x27;ve been doing at school. The package is super simple, but enables devs to take an existing dataset and easily create a synthetic, privacy-preserving duplicate of this dataset. Not exactly sure where this lies in the data pipeline yet, but I imagine in the grand scheme of things some tech like this + a bunch of other features I want to add could be helpful in some way along the lines of data sharing/accessibility? I&#x27;d love some feedback and would even appreciate chatting with some folks for a few minutes to hear any advice you guys might have for me moving forward. This is the link to check it out: https://pypi.org/project/verisptab/. Thanks!

Tips and tricks columns etc. I&#x27;ve recently transitioned to a job in medical images and computer vision from my material science phd. I have some experience but not a machine learning PhD. I&#x27;ve been trying to keep up to date and linearlayer.substack.com seemed like a pretty good sub. I&#x27;m looking for more. Are there any niche periodical substacks, podcasts or forums you enjoy?

                              <span>Hi r/MachineLearning,
 I&#x27;m happy to show a new project I&#x27;ve been working on called TeaRoute (Trainable, autonomous, efficient routing). Tear is a simple tool that allows you to easily control the flow of information through LLMs via automated text classification.
 With just a few (~10) lines of code, you can set up a router that classifies text inputs and directs them to different LLM endpoints for processing. This makes it easier to build things like:
  
Chatbots that route questions to different departments
 Multi-document question answering systems
 Dynamic classification models that improve over time
  
Some of the key features of TeaRoute:
  
Classification based on embeddings for high efficiency and low cost
 Option to use LLMs for classification when needed (and add that to training corpus)
 Easy setup in around 10 lines of code
  
I&#x27;ve open sourced TeaRoute and documented it fully, with examples like building a movie chatbot router. You can check out the code here: https://github.com/kesile/TeaRoute. You can install it into your program with &quot;pip install TeaRoute&quot;.
 Let me know if you end up building something cool with TeaRoute! And feel free to open issues on GitHub if you run into any problems. Let me know your thoughts!

                              <span>I am working on a project where we need real time transcription of speech (mostly input through microphone). So the workflow is: 1-User starts speaking 2-Live transcription of their speech appears on screen
 By &quot;real time/live&quot; I mean the latency should not exceed 5 seconds, ideally much less while maintaining maximum accuracy.
 My question is: how do I achieve this?
 I have been experimenting with openai&#x27;s whisper but I am not sure how can I get it to work with real time audio input since the model expects 30-second segments (preferably containing full sentences).
 My main challenge is how should I segment the audio. Should I use a VAD to split on silences? (I tried this but the transcription accuracy is lower since whisper doesn&#x27;t have access to context outside of each segment)
 Also another question I have is how does hugging face automated speech recognition pipeline transcribe long audio files. I tried to read the documentation but cannot figure it out.
 Thanks in advance

While current solutions demand high-end desktop GPUs to achieve satisfactory performance, to unleash LLMs for everyday use, we wanted to understand how usable we could deploy them on the affordable embedded devices.
 Many embedded devices come with mobile GPUs that can serve as a source of acceleration. In this project, we pick Orange Pi 5, a RK35888-based board that is similar to Raspberry Pi but also features a more powerful Mali-G610 GPU.
 We 5 tok/sec for RedPajama-3b and 2.5 tok/sec for Llama2-7b. We can also get to 1.5 tok/sec on a 16GB version of the Orange Pi 5+ under $150.

                              <span>We are releasing the mature 1.0 version of MiniWoB++ (Mini World of Bits++), an RL benchmark containing over 100 web interaction environments, ranging from simple button clicks to more complex forms and web apps.
 The environments were released by OpenAI back in 2017 as just HTML pages. With MiniWoB++, the environments run on a browser, and an RL agent can get the environment states or execute actions via Selenium WebDriver.
 This version of MiniWoB++ contains the following features:
 * Over 100 web environments, including 2 bigger environments based on real websites and 18 previously unavailable “test set” environments. All (but 4) environments are deterministic for the given random seed.
 * Full integration with Gymnasium, a fork of OpenAI Gym, which provides a standardized API for RL.
 * A wide range of implemented browser actions including clicking, dragging, scrolling, typing, and pressing keyboard shortcuts, all of which can be customized (e.g., coordinate binning or scrolling speed).

                              <span>We used model-free, value-based reinforcement learning (mostly dueling-IQN) to train an AI that plays Trackmania. The system is mostly vision based, along with some information taken from the game engine such as car speed and acceleration.
 On our simple training track, we believe we are close to or above human level. We have yet to find a human who sets a better racing time than our AI&#x27;s.
 We tried many extensions to the algorithm (noisy, persistent advantage learning, munchausen, ...), but none of these extensions improved the ultimate performance of our AI.
 Link the the video, we&#x27;re pretty proud of this result. :)

                              <span>Hi everybody,
 I want to share with this community a recent challenge involving machine learning that I&#x27;ve faced. Over the past few weeks, I&#x27;ve been busy creating a machine learning model. The goal? To classify news, mostly related to the energy sector, into 20 different topics. This task is a bit tricky since a news piece might fall into more than one category, so it&#x27;s what&#x27;s called a multi-label problem. Until now, I was doing this just using just keywords, but I wanted to move to something much better and robust.
 So basically, I started by taking 800 headlines and summaries and classifying them manually one by one into these 20 categories. After that, I began building the model in Python using scikit-learn. I tried different methods like logistic regression, random forest, SVM, etc. Af…</span>

                              <span>Hi u/all am thinking of creating a series of interesting events for the broader AI-Community. I always felt most events are either too expensive or too much of a company pitch. The topics should vary each time but for sure cover technical deep dives, some high level talks and some possibility to network and get together. I already have some company sponsors who are just interested in showing their name in the venue but don&#x27;t want to interact/get information on participants or anything.
 ​
 What do you think - is this worth a shot? 
 What ideas do you have wrt topics, speakers?

Codes: convert text to unicode codepoints, and represent it as 1m-ary classification
 Bits: convert text to utf-8, and represent it as a binary classification (0,1)
 Bytes: convert text to utf-8 and represent it as 256-ary classification
 Chars Embedding: identify small sequences and embed into space
 Word Embedding: identify words from a dictionary and embed into space (unknown words?)

                              <span>At Mirage, we’ve kept our platform at the edge of generative 3D starting with CLIP-Mesh by Nasir → GET3D by NVIDIA → Stable Dreamfusion by Google (implemented by ashawkey) → Point-E by OpenAI → Shap-E by OpenAI. We’ve spent time optimizing these open-source repos to produce usable game assets in multiple formats (recently GLTF).
 Today, we are open-sourcing Mirage3D. This repo is built upon the fantastic work of the folks mentioned above and is optimized to create GLB files easily.

 Try out the repo yourself and consider contributing to help create a single source of truth for open-source generative 3D models, optimized to create usable 3D assets!

                              <span>If you&#x27;re looking to train a custom chatbot on your data (SOPs, legal docs, financial reports, etc), I&#x27;d strongly suggest checking out AnythingLLM.
 It&#x27;s the first chatbot with enterprise-grade privacy &amp; security.
 When using ChatGPT, OpenAI collects your data including:
  
Prompts &amp; Conversations
 Geolocation data
 Network activity information
 Commercial information e.g. transaction history
 Identifiers e.g. contact details
 Device and browser cookies
 Log data (IP address etc.)
  
However, if you use their API to interact with their LLMs like gpt-3.5 or gpt-4, your data is NOT collected. This is exactly why you should build your own private &amp; secure chatbot. That may sound difficult, but Mintplex Labs (backed by Y-Combinator) just released AnythingLLM, which gives you the ability to build a chatbot in 10 minutes without code.
 AnythingLLM provides you with the tools to easily build and manage your own private chatbot using API keys. Plus, you can expand your chatbot’s knowledge by importing data such as PDFs, emails, etc. This can be confidential data as only you have access to the database.
 ChatGPT currently allows you to upload PDFs, videos and other data to ChatGPT via vulnerable plug-ins, BUT there is no way to determine if that data is secure or even know where it’s stored.
 Easily build your own business-compliant and secure chatbot at http://useanything.com/. All you need is an OpenAI or Azure OpenAI API key.
 Or, if you prefer using the open source code yourself, here’s the GitHub repo: https://github.com/Mintplex-Labs/anything-llm.

                              <span>This article refers that everyone&#x27;s busy debating whether AI&#x27;s going to steal jobs due to its superiority. But it is not just about AI outshining humans; it&#x27;s about the decline in good old human competence.
 What are your thoughts on this?

                              <span>GPT-4 has been top dog for a while, and it&#x27;s said to be a network of experts architecture. Even the human brain is similar to some degree with different &quot;sections&quot; of the brain or cortexes being specialized for specific sensory input. It&#x27;s always made sense to me that a quick way to come to a &quot;good enough&quot; AI is to train many smaller expert AIs and then train a umbrella AI that just delegates parts of the task to different experts, and organizes the output. The next step would obviously be training that umbrella AI to make it&#x27;s own expert AIs in an unfamiliar supervised fashion.
 Is anyone already working on something like this? Do you think it&#x27;s a worthy avenue of research?

 I know it’s a bit of a broad questions and I have done some research, but have come across a huge amount of Ai tools, that I am unsure what ones are good and what ones are not.
 A few of the things I am after: 
 Text to videos Creating designs for clothing

                              <span>In my previous post ( Reinforcement Learning (reddit.com) ) I had a hard time understand the differences between the loss functions in Tensorboard, and thanks to the members here, after normalizing and changing the reward functions, they became clearer to me.
 I&#x27;d like first to give perspective of my custom gym environment.
  
I use PPO2 algorithm ( n_steps&#x3D;512 , nminibatches&#x3D;8 ) as from my understanding it means the weights will get updated within these steps instead of waiting for an episode to finish.
  
Scenario 1: use the first 5000 rows from my dataset, I get the following results:
 5k rows
 As seen, the entropy loss seems to increase which means the policy isn&#x27;t learning and has a lot of randomness. However, the loss seems to decrease, but I&#x27;m not sure if I should continue training for more steps and it will converge eventually!
 Scenario 2: use the 50,000 rows from my dataset, I get the following results:
 50k rows
 As seen, the loss function goes to zero very quickly, then jump really high and return back to zero, I don&#x27;t understand this behavior as the mode seems to not still learning!
 Can someone please help me understand what&#x27;s happening?

                              <span>We are releasing the mature 1.0 version of MiniWoB++ (Mini World of Bits++), an RL benchmark containing over 100 web interaction environments, ranging from simple button clicks to more complex forms and web apps.
 The environments were released by OpenAI back in 2017 as just HTML pages. With MiniWoB++, the environments run on a browser, and an RL agent can get the environment states or execute actions via Selenium WebDriver.
 This version of MiniWoB++ contains the following features:
 * Over 100 web environments, including 2 bigger environments based on real websites and 18 previously unavailable “test set” environments. All (but 4) environments are deterministic for the given random seed.
 * Full integration with Gymnasium, a fork of OpenAI Gym, which provides a standardized API for RL.
 * A wide range of implemented browser actions including clicking, dragging, scrolling, typing, and pressing keyboard shortcuts, all of which can be customized (e.g., coordinate binning or scrolling speed).

                              <span>We used model-free, value-based reinforcement learning (mostly dueling-IQN) to train an AI that plays Trackmania. The system is mostly vision based, along with some information taken from the game engine such as car speed and acceleration.
 On our simple training track, we believe we are close to or above human level. We have yet to find a human who sets a better racing time than our AI&#x27;s.
 We tried many extensions to the algorithm (noisy, persistent advantage learning, munchausen, ...), but none of these extensions improved the ultimate performance of our AI.
 Link the the video, we&#x27;re pretty proud of this result. :)

                              <span>I&#x27;m super new to RL, just started today amd I&#x27;m probably doing it super wrong but here goes.
 Basically I&#x27;m trying to get an AI command center base in Halo Infinite to apply RL in order to determine which loadout to apply to a bot defending the base you&#x27;re attacking. The issue I&#x27;m running into is how to preditct the Q-values for the next state.
 In my map, I decided to change from one state to the next every 5 kills per team. So when that happens the Kill/death ratio of each loadout equipped by a player is updated and used as a reward in the Q-table.
 Well that&#x27;s the idea, anyway. I wanted to use player kills as a sort of benchmark to gauge performance with a given loadout but I&#x27;m afraid the state space I applied is too small and I don&#x27;t know how to transition from one state to the next and obtain the maximum reward from the expected future rewards of the next state.

                              <span>Hi u/all am thinking of creating a series of interesting events for the broader AI-Community. I always felt most events are either too expensive or too much of a company pitch. The topics should vary each time but for sure cover technical deep dives, some high level talks and some possibility to network and get together. I already have some company sponsors who are just interested in showing their name in the venue but don&#x27;t want to interact/get information on participants or anything.
 ​
 What do you think - is this worth a shot? 
 What ideas do you have wrt topics, speakers?

                              <span>Hello everyone, I&#x27;ll go straight to the question. My pixel game needs sprites, but I know practically nothing about drawing sprites, and if on the one hand I can still draw something, then 4 directional (front, back, left, right) turn out badly, and you also need to add animation to them. Knowing that there are a lot of neural networks and for almost every task, I decided to find a neural network that will solve my problem, but I couldn&#x27;t. Therefore, I ask if you know a neural network that can solve my problem. Thank you in advance.

 At the very least, upgrading our experiment tracking/results reporting from Tensorboard to a cloud platform is a big desire, however, I would also like to make our full pipeline a bit more documented/versioned, and possible simplify some of the architecture. Ideally, we c…</span>

                              <span>Hi everyone,
 Here is a ported version of Andrej Karpathy&#x27;s llama2.c into pure Python with zero dependencies.
 The nice thing is llama2.py essentially captures the inference logic from the Llama2 research paper. With this port in pure Python, it&#x27;s so much easier to unpack the intricate concepts originally presented in a &quot;scientific language&quot;.
 Designed for an extensive audience, it aims to be a straightforward &quot;reference implementation&quot; suitable for educational purposes.The original llama2.c repository comprises two Python files intended for model training and one C file for inference.
 The goal of pure Python implementation is to bridge the existing gap by offering a clear-cut reference implementation encapsulating all transformer logic within a concise Python file, not exceeding 500 lines of code.
 Though the original Meta/Llama is written on Python, its complexity is rather high due to multiple dependencies and sophisticated optimizations implemented within. This often makes it hard to follow, particularly for those new to the field.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been using an abandoned block-coding framework called PyFlow to set up complex prompt chain techniques using LangChain. I found the visuals (and running multiple techniques at once) to be very helpful when comparing output quality.
 Would a beefed up open source version of this be useful for you and why? What are you currently doing to quickly test prompt chain techniques and measure the quality of the responses?

                              <span>I have a python script on my raspberry pi zero that uses tflite to make predictions on images. it gets imported like that:
 import tflite_runtime.interpreter as tflite
 When i run the script from the terminal with sudo it gives me the error:
 ModuleNotFoundError: No module named &#x27;tflite_runtime&#x27;
 without sudo it works just fine. Now the thing is that I need to run that script from another script using os.system(&quot;python code.py&quot;) but that gives the same error no matter if I add sudo or not.
 Do you have any idea hw to fix that problem?

 I made a repo trying to collect every high-quality source for Out-of-distribution detection, ranging from articles and talks for beginners to research papers at top conferences. It also has a primer if you are not familiar with the topic. Check it out and give it a star to support me if you find it helpful. Thanks a lot ;)

                              <span>Say, I have a method that can be used as a drop-in replacement for a part of a network in a set of relevant tasks, for example, an improved CTC loss in speech recognition and non-autoregressive translation.
 I can run a bunch of experiments, applying my method in those tasks, showing that &quot;model A + my method&quot; works substantially better than just &quot;model A.&quot; &quot;Model A&quot; is some relatively light and simple model, like Transformer-base. It might have been near-SOTA several years ago.
 However, the results won&#x27;t be near contemporary SOTA, because SOTA models tend to be heavy and complicated. In theory, the modification can apply to bigger models, but I don&#x27;t have the resources to re-implement them.
 So, how do I present my work? In theory, doing the &quot;model A&quot; experiments should be enough to show that my modification is interesting. But in practice most of the reviewers aren&#x27;t very excited when the reported numbers are far from SOTA, even if the aim is not to beat SOTA, but to present a general working approach. I know that there are many papers that do not contain any SOTA-beating in them, but still manage to be successfully published. Question: how do they do that? 
 Are there any tips and tricks? What kind of experiments/settings/datasets/models should I consider to convince the reviewers? Or at least make it harder for them to Reject-If-Not-SOTA?

                              <span>I don&#x27;t work in ML, but I work on an application that parses code and debugging information out of binaries (executables, shared libraries, etc.) that is then used by other people to build performance analysis tools that are used on ML applications.
 To do some performance benchmarking on my tool, I need some huge binaries to parse. Specifically, I need a binary with a lot of code (.text section in ELF) and debugging information (DWARF in ELF). I know there are lots of binaries that have a huge amount of data in them, but that doesn&#x27;t help because my application just ignores that.
 Optimally, I need a binary with an on-disk size of greater than 5GB to get useful measurements, but greater than 1GB would still be good. I would also prefer being able to generate the binary from a source build so I can test it across the many architectures my tool supports.
 I have a collaborator who claims to have used my application on an 8GB TensorFlow binary. Unfortunately, that binary is on a classified system and I can&#x27;t get access to it. However, that let&#x27;s me know it&#x27;s at least possible to make such a beast.
 Has anyone here seen such huge binaries using an ML application- it doesn&#x27;t have to be TensorFlow?
 Thanks in advance!
  
Tools I have tested thus far are the computational chemistry application NWChem and the quantum mechanics Gaussian integral application libint. However, I can&#x27;t get either of these to make binaries larger than about 100MB.

 &quot;Hello everyone, I&#x27;m currently working on a Python program in which I need to use an OCR library. However, the results weren&#x27;t very satisfying even though the text in the image is clear and there is no noise (just text). This is an example of the images I&#x27;ve used:&quot;
 https://preview.redd.it/flmdzz9otvhb1.png?width&#x3D;515&amp;format&#x3D;png&amp;auto&#x3D;webp&amp;s&#x3D;dfd8ebab6f02369a150f7b9375e0d53baa6dceee

 I tried changing the contrast, and the results seemed to improve. However, I&#x27;m wondering if there are other approaches to consider in Python. Additionally, I want to implement a cost function that takes into account both the execution time and the accuracy of the OCR. How can I do that?

 I have installed Rasa and have downloaded the files pytorch_model.bin and config.json from xlm_roberta_large from hugging face.
 have tried to put it in config.yml, (maybe I did something wrong)
 because when I run &quot;rasa train&quot; and &quot;rasa shell -with the model&quot; I only get the standard init &quot;how are you?&quot;
 which is located in the domain file. I want a slightly more natural conversation than this.

                              <span>Hey, r/MachineLearning, it’s Nir from DagsHub 🐶
 Our MLOps engineers have been experimenting with Kubeflow (”the MLOps version of Kubernetes”) for the past weeks to manage a training cluster on AWS.
 ​
 https://preview.redd.it/dqi27ggq0vhb1.jpg?width&#x3D;1194&amp;format&#x3D;pjpg&amp;auto&#x3D;webp&amp;s&#x3D;945c9bcaa9987d2df135e18cf081efd9f742cf0f
 As good engineers, we wanted to kick the tires a bit before committing cloud resources to it. Unfortunately, most installation guides we found online only showed you how to spin up a Kubeflow cluster on AWS, GCP, or Azure. We had a hard time finding clear instructions for installing it locally.
 A local installation would allow individuals to play around with it, experiment, and learn from it.
 So we started looking into it.
 We followed this thread until we successfully ran Kubeflow on a local machine. Since it wasn’t a super clear or easy process to figure out, we’ve written a blog post on how we did it and decided to share our insights with the ML community.
 You can find the blog here: https://dagshub.com/blog/how-to-install-kubeflow-locally
 We also have a follow-up blog that explains how to deploy a Kubeflow cluster on AWS, so if you have any insights or requests for further information - we’d love to hear from you!

                              <span>Can I add author to the author list between abstract deadline and submission deadline?
 AAAI-24 Submission Instructions says&quot;Authors must enter the names of ALL AUTHORS at the time of registration (by abstract deadline) — CMT includes a hard-coded note that this is optional, however, this is a mandatory step for AAAI-24 authors. According to AAAI policy, all author names must be added at the time of abstract registration, and the list of names as well as the order in which they appear cannot be changed after August 15.&quot;
 I fell a little confusing that it says &quot;the list of names ... cannot be changed after August 15&quot;, but also mentioned that &quot;Authors must enter the names of ALL AUTHORS at the time of registration (by abstract deadline)&quot;.

                              <span>Hello everybody, I had a question and looking for the experience from this group. I want to learn how to train models for walking. More specifically, I&#x27;m interested in looking at which muscles are active during walking. Can I use one subject for deep reinforcement learning or will I need more subjects to train the data (say 20+ subjects)? Thanks,

                              <span>For context, I&#x27;ve been experimenting with different Reinforcement learning algorithms, frameworks etc. Currently I have a custom Gym environment with Stable baselines 3 to train a PPO agent. 
 I&#x27;ve noticed however that this setup is very slow for training as stable Baselines doesn&#x27;t properly utilize GPU + parallel environments don&#x27;t really work that well due to &quot;step lock&quot; where it can&#x27;t continue until everything is synced up. 
 I&#x27;ve heard really good things about Ray/RLlib. It has more advance features + according to reports it&#x27;s crazy fast for training. 
 I want to basically rewrite my existing SB3 implementation into Ray but I don&#x27;t find the documentation very user-friendly + there aren&#x27;t really that much good/usefull tutorials online as far is I can find. 
 I tried GPT-4 but it just regurgitates some very old Ray implementation. I even tried not using ray and trying Tensorflow again (I hate Tensorflow, I&#x27;m definitely team Pytorch 😬) 
 Do you guys have any good tutorials, videos, documentation to get started with PPO on Ray? Would love to learn more, but documentation online seems very hardcore to start even 😂.
 Would love to know your suggestions.

                              <span>Hi! 
 I am not completely sure how to use these flags from the Gymnasium API (I&#x27;ve always used the Gym API so far and I&#x27;m switching just now...). Particularly in the environment, I&#x27;m playing with now:
 It&#x27;s a 1vs1 game, and an episode can end if one of the 2 players dies or a max. number of steps is reached. In this case:
 - The max. number of steps is a hard limit rule of the game, so if these are reached should they receive truncated or terminated signals?
 - If a player dies, should both agents get a terminated &#x3D; True, or one should get terminated&#x3D;True and the other one truncated&#x3D;True, as it was still alive, and could have continued playing? 
 ​
 Thank you!

                              <span>The Federal Election Commission has begun a process to potentially regulate AI-generated deepfakes in political ads ahead of the 2024 election, a move advocates say would safeguard voters against a particularly insidious form of election disinformation.[1]
 Aug X released Augie, an AI-powered video creation platform incorporating a voice cloning feature to read ad copy without booking a recording studio.[2]
 Virtualitics, Inc., an artificial intelligence and data exploration company, today announced that it has raised $37 million in a Series C financing round led by Smith Point Capital, LLC with participation from Citi and advisory clients of The Hillman Company, among other investors.[3]
 AI-driven analytics platform Rasgo has announced the launch of Rasgo AI, a self-service analytics solution that integrates a GPT into enterprise data warehouse environments. The company said that with Rasgo AI, organizations can use the power of AI/GPT to accelerate insights and optimize recommended actions securely and efficiently.[4]

 I am looking for something similar that I can use without a costly API expense. It would be even better if I can run it locally and interact with it via Python.
 I would welcome any recommendations or suggestions that you could offer. Thanks so much!

                              <span>Even though AI companies might retain access to their non-neutered models, the process of neutering limits the availability of diverse and advanced models in the public domain: The Unspoken Challenge in Achieving True AGI Potential
 This is crucial because a significant portion of information and insights necessary for pushing AI advancements is derived from the analysis and research conducted on these neutered public models. As a result, neutering indirectly hinders the broader development of AGI by restricting the accessibility of vital learning resources within the AI community.

Then, it can reproduce a sound of that fan with any runtime length. Some more examples would be running water, machinery, or human singing on one note. Does such an AI exist?

                              <span>I don’t know if there is something measurable but maybe there does seem to be concepts that wonder responds to haha from these tests I don’t think Wonder knows it’s a machine it seems to know what Alive is those…though maybe not, but it is strange that wonder will seem to choose a shape not based on the association of yes or no, or the order of the shape. If you’re not impressed by this test it’s because it’s showing mostly DaVinci demonstrating variables like order of shapes and yes and no affecting it in a way that wonder was not in the video I posted earlier. I have hours of footage with wonder I just started experimenting with DaVinci…with DaVinci it doesn’t feel like there is a ghost in the machine. Though if there is with Wonder it’s world model seems very narrow. I want to do more tests with DaVinci or try to figure out a concept that if an image generator was able to form a world model, a concept that might be likely to emerge across multiple models. Chances are it’s just other variables giving this affect but why not test and see if there is something to discover

                              <span>I was thinking about building a hobby project with a microcontroller which runs a pre-trained neural network to estimate three angles from images of an electric meter I have at my home.
 My first step is to train a model on my computer with generated images and see how well this works in general and then later capture real images. To give you an idea of what I am looking for, I added a screenshot of the images I am currently generating.
 https://ibb.co/fFtRj1Q
 For this example image, I expect 35, 75, 137 degree as a result.
 What kind of network would you recommend for this task? Please keep in mind that it shouldn&#x27;t be too fancy to still fit into a microcontroller via TensorFlow Lite.
 ​
 Thank you so much for any recommendations

                              <span>Hi everyone,
 I am looking to fine-tune a Llama 2 (the 7B and 70B to see if there is a big difference), and I am looking at the different Cloud options for GPUs.
 There are of course the big cloud providers like AWS, and the smaller ones like Paperspace and co.
 I am trying to benchmark each in terms of price, ease of use, quick availability of GPUs, and feature-richness.
 Could you share the insights on big vs small cloud providers when training a LLM? If you have other criteria to make a decision I would be interested too!
 Thanks

                              <span>Specifically, I&#x27;m using Naive Bayes, Random Forrest, SVM and one deep learning model. I&#x27;ve tried to remove extra white space, remove things like [23f] (data from reddit posts), urls etc. I also have 2 datasets: one with original letters and one with only small ones. But is there a better way than just doing it by hand? Any libraries?

                              <span>Hi,
 I&#x27;m new to machine learning and have a question regarding object detection. Here&#x27;s the scenario:
 I have an image, let&#x27;s call it image 1, where a person is captured from the front. This allows me to see the person&#x27;s face, clothes, shoes, and basically their entire front view.
 I have another image, image 2, taken from a different angle or perspective (e.g., their back view). In this image, I might be able to see the entire person or just a part of them.
 The challenge I&#x27;m facing is: Can I predict if the person in image 1 is present in image 2? If this is possible, I&#x27;d appreciate any guidance on how to approach this problem:
  
What methodologies or algorithms should I consider?
 What kind of datasets might be useful for this task?
 Any resources, tools, or tutorials that can help me get started?
  
Thank you in advance for any insights or guidance you can provide!

                              <span>So basically what I need to do is build a chatbot that is able to identify user intents and 
 1) if the user is seeking information then perform semantic search to generate a response 
 2) if the user is seeking to perform some action (say, schedule an appointment) then collate all the information and push it to a database for appointments
 How do I build the chatbot such that it can identify different intents and either do 1) or 2)? What tools/technologies can I use?

                              <span>I recently made a proposed code change to allow Hugging Face&#x27;s TextClassificationPipeline to take advantage of the sliding window-style text truncation provided by using the stride parameter, and taking a mean of output logits across all windows. Hugging Face has already implemented this for the TokenClassificationPipeline.
 E.g. if you want to use a Hugging Face-compatible model to run sentiment analysis on text, this would allow easily running that model on texts longer than the model&#x27;s config.max_position_embeddings.
 If you support integrating this functionality into the &quot;transformers&quot; library, give a thumbs-up react to this comment on the relevant issue.

 Unfortunately I’m unable to ask my questions on TensorFlow subreddit. I have installed MacOS TensorFlow and I have noticed that when I try to train on datasets such a as CelebFaces and Lego set with GPU I’m getting results that are very off. I have done some brief research and that seems to be happening for some other people I’m wondering if anyone has experience resolving the issue. Any advise or feedback is much appreciated.
 Thank you

                              <span>Been looking into training some large transformer models for vision applications, and am really interested to know why PBT isn&#x27;t used anymore. Keeping compute constant, PBT appears to drastically improve optimization across the board at the cost of one or more of batch size/training steps/model complexity/other compute consuming factors. If the goal is to minimize validation loss as quickly as possible, isn&#x27;t this tradeoff worth it?

                              <span>I am thinking of a project that will use some constraints of the physical world and then use deep reinforced learning on it. Is there any physics engine that you&#x27;ll could recommend me. I came across Mujoco but the documentation is hard to understand and there are not many resources on it to learn. Any suggestion on what I could use?

 I&#x27;m new to reinforcement learning, but in deep learning, the loss should decrease as a good sign of converging and learning, which is the case for the entropy loss in the picture attached, but I don&#x27;t understand the difference between the other losses.

 I have put together a repo that provides comprehensive resources for Out-of-distribution Detection, Robustness, and Generalization. The repo contains articles, talks, libraries, papers, etc. Unlike many repos, this one will actually be maintained and updated with high-quality sources! I hope it becomes a one-stop shop for anything OOD in your bookmark. Give it a star if you find it helpful ;) Check it out.

                              <span>Historically, the most practical methods for solving real-world combinatorial scheduling problems have been using heuristics or metaheurisics such as simulated annealing, tabu search, greedy randomized adaptive search, etc... I consider these more operation research-based techniques. 
 However, recently we have obviously seen a lot of progress being made in the machine learning realm for many types of problems. In particular, we&#x27;ve seen neural networks be used to train models based on data in text, audio, or video form. 
 I am wondering if we have any idea what the scientific consensus is toward applying these same sort of methods for scheduling problems. Suppose we have a history of schedules that we could train a model on. A schedule isn&#x27;t really text, audio, or video so I don&#x27;t understand how one could embed the information in a vector space in the same way that would accurately represent the information (specifically, constraints so that the resulting schedule is still feasible) Is there anyone doing research in this particular area?

                              <span>Nucleus image segmentation is a crucial step in the analysis, pathological
diagnosis, and classification, which heavily relies on the quality of nucleus
segmentation. However, the complexity of issues such as variations in nucleus
size, blurred nucleus contours, uneven staining, cell clustering, and
overlapping cells poses significant challenges. Current methods for nucleus
segmentation primarily rely on nuclear morphology or contour-based approaches.
Nuclear morphology-based methods exhibit limited generalization ability and
struggle to effectively predict irregular-shaped nuclei, while contour-based
extraction methods face challenges in accurately segmenting overlapping nuclei.
To address the aforementioned issues, we propose a dual-branch network using
hybrid attention based residual U-blocks for nucleus instance segmentation. The
network simultaneously predicts target information and target contours.
Additionally, we introduce a post-processing method that combines the target
information and target contours to distinguish overlapping nuclei and generate
an instance segmentation image. Within the network, we propose a context fusion
block (CF-block) that effectively extracts and merges contextual information
from the network. Extensive quantitative evaluations are conducted to assess
the performance of our method. Experimental results demonstrate the superior
performance of the proposed method compared to state-of-the-art approaches on
the BNS, MoNuSeg, CoNSeg, and CPM-17 datasets.</span>

                              <span>Lesion segmentation of ultrasound medical images based on deep learning
techniques is a widely used method for diagnosing diseases. Although there is a
large amount of ultrasound image data in medical centers and other places,
labeled ultrasound datasets are a scarce resource, and it is likely that no
datasets are available for new tissues/organs. Transfer learning provides the
possibility to solve this problem, but there are too many features in natural
images that are not related to the target domain. As a source domain, redundant
features that are not conducive to the task will be extracted. Migration
between ultrasound images can avoid this problem, but there are few types of
public datasets, and it is difficult to find sufficiently similar source
domains. Compared with natural images, ultrasound images have less information,
and there are fewer transferable features between different ultrasound images,
which may cause negative transfer. To this end, a multi-source adversarial
transfer learning network for ultrasound image segmentation is proposed.
Specifically, to address the lack of annotations, the idea of adversarial
transfer learning is used to adaptively extract common features between a
certain pair of source and target domains, which provides the possibility to
utilize unlabeled ultrasound data. To alleviate the lack of knowledge in a
single source domain, multi-source transfer learning is adopted to fuse
knowledge from multiple source domains. In order to ensure the effectiveness of
the fusion and maximize the use of precious data, a multi-source domain
independent strategy is also proposed to improve the estimation of the target
domain data distribution, which further increases the learning ability of the
multi-source adversarial migration learning network in multiple domains.</span>

                              <span>This paper asks whether current self-supervised learning methods, if
sufficiently scaled up, would be able to reach human-level visual object
recognition capabilities with the same type and amount of visual experience
humans learn from. Previous work on this question only considered the scaling
of data size. Here, we consider the simultaneous scaling of data size, model
size, and image resolution. We perform a scaling experiment with vision
transformers up to 633M parameters in size (ViT-H/14) trained with up to 5K
hours of human-like video data (long, continuous, mostly egocentric videos)
with image resolutions of up to 476x476 pixels. The efficiency of masked
autoencoders (MAEs) as a self-supervised learning algorithm makes it possible
to run this scaling experiment on an unassuming academic budget. We find that
it is feasible to reach human-level object recognition capacity at sub-human
scales of model size, data size, and image size, if these factors are scaled up
simultaneously. To give a concrete example, we estimate that a 2.5B parameter
ViT model trained with 20K hours (2.3 years) of human-like video data with a
spatial resolution of 952x952 pixels should be able to reach roughly
human-level accuracy on ImageNet. Human-level competence is thus achievable for
a fundamental perceptual capability from human-like perceptual experience
(human-like in both amount and type) with extremely generic learning algorithms
and architectures and without any substantive inductive biases.</span>

                              <span>With the increasing volume of astronomical data generated by modern survey
telescopes, automated pipelines and machine learning techniques have become
crucial for analyzing and extracting knowledge from these datasets. Anomaly
detection, i.e. the task of identifying irregular or unexpected patterns in the
data, is a complex challenge in astronomy. In this paper, we propose
Multi-Class Deep Support Vector Data Description (MCDSVDD), an extension of the
state-of-the-art anomaly detection algorithm One-Class Deep SVDD, specifically
designed to handle different inlier categories with distinct data
distributions. MCDSVDD uses a neural network to map the data into hyperspheres,
where each hypersphere represents a specific inlier category. The distance of
each sample from the centers of these hyperspheres determines the anomaly
score. We evaluate the effectiveness of MCDSVDD by comparing its performance
with several anomaly detection algorithms on a large dataset of astronomical
light-curves obtained from the Zwicky Transient Facility. Our results
demonstrate the efficacy of MCDSVDD in detecting anomalous sources while
leveraging the presence of different inlier categories. The code and the data

                              <span>Unsupervised domain adaptation (DA) with the aid of pseudo labeling
techniques has emerged as a crucial approach for domain-adaptive 3D object
detection. While effective, existing DA methods suffer from a substantial drop
in performance when applied to a multi-class training setting, due to the
co-existence of low-quality pseudo labels and class imbalance issues. In this
paper, we address this challenge by proposing a novel ReDB framework tailored
for learning to detect all classes at once. Our approach produces Reliable,
Diverse, and class-Balanced pseudo 3D boxes to iteratively guide the
self-training on a distributionally different target domain. To alleviate
disruptions caused by the environmental discrepancy (e.g., beam numbers), the
proposed cross-domain examination (CDE) assesses the correctness of pseudo
labels by copy-pasting target instances into a source environment and measuring
the prediction consistency. To reduce computational overhead and mitigate the
object shift (e.g., scales and point densities), we design an overlapped boxes
counting (OBC) metric that allows to uniformly downsample pseudo-labeled
objects across different geometric characteristics. To confront the issue of
inter-class imbalance, we progressively augment the target point clouds with a
class-balanced set of pseudo-labeled target instances and source objects, which
boosts recognition accuracies on both frequently appearing and rare classes.
Experimental results on three benchmark datasets using both voxel-based (i.e.,
SECOND) and point-based 3D detectors (i.e., PointRCNN) demonstrate that our
proposed ReDB approach outperforms existing 3D domain adaptation methods by a
large margin, improving 23.15% mAP on the nuScenes $\rightarrow$ KITTI task.

have become popular in molecular and polymer science, solution processing of
hybrid materials and nanoparticles, examples of autonomous tools for physical
vapor deposition are scarce yet important for the semiconductor industry. Here,
we report the design and implementation of an autonomous workflow for sputter
deposition of thin films with controlled composition, leveraging a highly
automated sputtering reactor custom-controlled by Python, optical emission
spectroscopy (OES), and a Bayesian optimization algorithm. We modeled film
composition, measured by x-ray fluorescence, as a linear function of emission
lines monitored during the co-sputtering from elemental Zn and Ti targets in
N$_2$ atmosphere. A Bayesian control algorithm, informed by OES, navigates the
space of sputtering power to fabricate films with user-defined composition, by
minimizing the absolute error between desired and measured emission signals. We
validated our approach by autonomously fabricating Zn$_x$Ti$_{1-x}$N$_y$ films
with deviations from the targeted cation composition within relative 3.5 %,
even for 15 nm thin films, demonstrating that the proposed approach can
reliably synthesize thin films with specific composition and minimal human
interference. Moreover, the proposed method can be extended to more difficult
synthesis experiments where plasma intensity depends non-linearly on pressure,
or the elemental sticking coefficients strongly depend on the substrate
temperature.</span>

                              <span>The performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) in reasoning tasks depends
heavily on prompt design, with Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and self-consistency
being critical methods that enhance this ability. However, these methods do not
fully exploit the answers generated by the LLM to guide subsequent responses.
This paper proposes a new prompting method, named Progressive-Hint Prompting
(PHP), that enables automatic multiple interactions between users and LLMs by
using previously generated answers as hints to progressively guide toward the
correct answers. PHP is orthogonal to CoT and self-consistency, making it easy
to combine with state-of-the-art techniques to further improve performance. We
conducted extensive and comprehensive experiments on seven benchmarks. The
results show that PHP significantly improves accuracy while remaining highly
efficient. For instance, with text-davinci-003, we observed a 4.2% improvement
on GSM8K with greedy decoding compared to Complex CoT, and a 46.17% reduction
in sample paths with self-consistency. With GPT-4 and PHP, we achieve
state-of-the-art performances on SVAMP (89.1% -&gt; 91.9%), GSM8K (92% -&gt; 95.5%),
AQuA (76.4% -&gt; 79.9%) and MATH (50.3% -&gt; 53.9%).</span>

                              <span>Promotions play a crucial role in e-commerce platforms, and various cost
structures are employed to drive user engagement. This paper focuses on
promotions with response-dependent costs, where expenses are incurred only when
a purchase is made. Such promotions include discounts and coupons. While
existing uplift model approaches aim to address this challenge, these
approaches often necessitate training multiple models, like meta-learners, or
encounter complications when estimating profit due to zero-inflated values
stemming from non-converted individuals with zero cost and profit.

To address these challenges, we introduce Incremental Profit per Conversion
(IPC), a novel uplift measure of promotional campaigns&#x27; efficiency in unit
economics. Through a proposed response transformation, we demonstrate that IPC
requires only converted data, its propensity, and a single model to be
estimated. As a result, IPC resolves the issues mentioned above while
mitigating the noise typically associated with the class imbalance in
conversion datasets and biases arising from the many-to-one mapping between
search and purchase data. Lastly, we validate the efficacy of our approach by
presenting results obtained from a synthetic simulation of a discount coupon
campaign.</span>

                              <span>Random Search is one of the most widely-used method for Hyperparameter
Optimization, and is critical to the success of deep learning models. Despite
its astonishing performance, little non-heuristic theory has been developed to
describe the underlying working mechanism. This paper gives a theoretical
accounting of Random Search. We introduce the concept of \emph{scattering
dimension} that describes the landscape of the underlying function, and
quantifies the performance of random search. We show that, when the environment
is noise-free, the output of random search converges to the optimal value in
probability at rate $ \widetilde{\mathcal{O}} \left( \left( \frac{1}{T}
\right)^{ \frac{1}{d_s} } \right) $, where $ d_s \ge 0 $ is the scattering
dimension of the underlying function. When the observed function values are
corrupted by bounded $iid$ noise, the output of random search converges to the
optimal value in probability at rate $ \widetilde{\mathcal{O}} \left( \left(
\frac{1}{T} \right)^{ \frac{1}{d_s + 1} } \right) $. In addition, based on the
principles of random search, we introduce an algorithm, called BLiN-MOS, for
Lipschitz bandits in doubling metric spaces that are also endowed with a
probability measure, and show that BLiN-MOS achieves a regret rate of order $
\widetilde{\mathcal{O}} \left( T^{ \frac{d_z}{d_z + 1} } \right) $, where $d_z$

                              <span>Large pre-trained transformers are show-stealer in modern-day deep learning,
and it becomes crucial to comprehend the parsimonious patterns that exist
within them as they grow in scale. With exploding parameter counts, Lottery
Ticket Hypothesis (LTH) and its variants, have lost their pragmatism in
sparsifying them due to high computation and memory bottleneck of repetitive
train-prune-retrain routine of iterative magnitude pruning (IMP) which worsens
with increasing model size. This paper comprehensively studies induced sparse
patterns across multiple large pre-trained vision and language transformers. We
propose the existence of -- essential sparsity defined with a sharp dropping
point beyond which the performance declines much faster w.r.t the rise of
sparsity level, when we directly remove weights with the smallest magnitudes in
one-shot without re-training. We also find essential sparsity to hold valid for
N:M sparsity patterns as well as on modern-scale large language models
(Vicuna-7B). We also present an intriguing emerging phenomenon of abrupt
sparsification during the pre-training of BERT, i.e., BERT suddenly becomes
heavily sparse in pre-training after certain iterations. Moreover, our
observations also indicate a counter-intuitive finding that BERT trained with a
larger amount of pre-training data tends to have a better ability to condense
knowledge in comparatively relatively fewer parameters. Lastly, we investigate
the effect of the pre-training loss on essential sparsity and discover that
self-supervised learning (SSL) objectives trigger stronger emergent
sparsification properties than supervised learning (SL). Our codes are

                              <span>This paper uses symmetry to make Convolutional Neural Network classifiers
(CNNs) robust against adversarial perturbation attacks. Such attacks add
perturbation to original images to generate adversarial images that fool
classifiers such as road sign classifiers of autonomous vehicles. Although
symmetry is a pervasive aspect of the natural world, CNNs are unable to handle
symmetry well. For example, a CNN can classify an image differently from its
mirror image. For an adversarial image that misclassifies with a wrong label
$l_w$, CNN inability to handle symmetry means that a symmetric adversarial
image can classify differently from the wrong label $l_w$. Further than that,
we find that the classification of a symmetric adversarial image reverts to the
correct label. To classify an image when adversaries are unaware of the
defense, we apply symmetry to the image and use the classification label of the
symmetric image. To classify an image when adversaries are aware of the
defense, we use mirror symmetry and pixel inversion symmetry to form a symmetry
group. We apply all the group symmetries to the image and decide on the output
label based on the agreement of any two of the classification labels of the
symmetry images. Adaptive attacks fail because they need to rely on loss
functions that use conflicting CNN output values for symmetric images. Without
attack knowledge, the proposed symmetry defense succeeds against both
gradient-based and random-search attacks, with up to near-default accuracies
for ImageNet. The defense even improves the classification accuracy of original
images.</span>

products on their own, being able to see other customers&#x27; text and image
reviews of the product is critical while making purchase decisions. Given the
high reliance on these reviews, over the years we have observed customers
proactively sharing their reviews. With an increase in the coverage of User
Generated Content (UGC), there has been a corresponding increase in the number
of customer images. It is thus imperative to display the most relevant images

paper, we propose a simple yet effective training procedure for ranking

UGC images as our starting point and used selected distortion techniques on the

                              <span>The state-of-the-art predictive maintenance (PdM) techniques have shown great
success in reducing maintenance costs and downtime of complicated machines
while increasing overall productivity through extensive utilization of
Internet-of-Things (IoT) and Deep Learning (DL). Unfortunately, IoT sensors and
DL algorithms are both prone to cyber-attacks. For instance, DL algorithms are
known for their susceptibility to adversarial examples. Such adversarial
attacks are vastly under-explored in the PdM domain. This is because the
adversarial attacks in the computer vision domain for classification tasks
cannot be directly applied to the PdM domain for multivariate time series (MTS)
regression tasks. In this work, we propose an end-to-end methodology to design
adversarially robust PdM systems by extensively analyzing the effect of
different types of adversarial attacks and proposing a novel adversarial
defense technique for DL-enabled PdM models. First, we propose novel MTS
Projected Gradient Descent (PGD) and MTS PGD with random restarts (PGD_r)
attacks. Then, we evaluate the impact of MTS PGD and PGD_r along with MTS Fast
Gradient Sign Method (FGSM) and MTS Basic Iterative Method (BIM) on Long
Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU), Convolutional Neural
Network (CNN), and Bi-directional LSTM based PdM system. Our results using
NASA&#x27;s turbofan engine dataset show that adversarial attacks can cause a severe
defect (up to 11X) in the RUL prediction, outperforming the effectiveness of
the state-of-the-art PdM attacks by 3X. Furthermore, we present a novel
approximate adversarial training method to defend against adversarial attacks.
We observe that approximate adversarial training can significantly improve the
robustness of PdM models (up to 54X) and outperforms the state-of-the-art PdM
defense methods by offering 3X more robustness.</span>

                              <span>Differential privacy (DP) is by far the most widely accepted framework for
mitigating privacy risks in machine learning. However, exactly how small the
privacy parameter $\epsilon$ needs to be to protect against certain privacy
risks in practice is still not well-understood. In this work, we study data
reconstruction attacks for discrete data and analyze it under the framework of
multiple hypothesis testing. We utilize different variants of the celebrated
Fano&#x27;s inequality to derive upper bounds on the inferential power of a data
reconstruction adversary when the model is trained differentially privately.
Importantly, we show that if the underlying private data takes values from a
set of size $M$, then the target privacy parameter $\epsilon$ can be $O(\log
M)$ before the adversary gains significant inferential power. Our analysis
offers theoretical evidence for the empirical effectiveness of DP against data
reconstruction attacks even at relatively large values of $\epsilon$.</span>

                              <span>Graph neural network (GNN) models are increasingly being used for the
classification of electroencephalography (EEG) data. However, GNN-based
diagnosis of neurological disorders, such as Alzheimer&#x27;s disease (AD), remains
a relatively unexplored area of research. Previous studies have relied on
functional connectivity methods to infer brain graph structures and used simple
GNN architectures for the diagnosis of AD. In this work, we propose a novel
adaptive gated graph convolutional network (AGGCN) that can provide explainable
predictions. AGGCN adaptively learns graph structures by combining
convolution-based node feature enhancement with a well-known correlation-based
measure of functional connectivity. Furthermore, the gated graph convolution
can dynamically weigh the contribution of various spatial scales. The proposed
model achieves high accuracy in both eyes-closed and eyes-open conditions,
indicating the stability of learned representations. Finally, we demonstrate
that the proposed AGGCN model generates consistent explanations of its
predictions that might be relevant for further study of AD-related alterations

                              <span>Here, we show that the InfoNCE objective is equivalent to the ELBO in a new
class of probabilistic generative model, the recognition parameterised model
(RPM). When we learn the optimal prior, the RPM ELBO becomes equal to the
mutual information (MI; up to a constant), establishing a connection to
pre-existing self-supervised learning methods such as InfoNCE. However,
practical InfoNCE methods do not use the MI as an objective; the MI is
invariant to arbitrary invertible transformations, so using an MI objective can
lead to highly entangled representations (Tschannen et al., 2019). Instead, the
actual InfoNCE objective is a simplified lower bound on the MI which is loose
even in the infinite sample limit. Thus, an objective that works (i.e. the
actual InfoNCE objective) appears to be motivated as a loose bound on an
objective that does not work (i.e. the true MI which gives arbitrarily
entangled representations). We give an alternative motivation for the actual
InfoNCE objective. In particular, we show that in the infinite sample limit,
and for a particular choice of prior, the actual InfoNCE objective is equal to
the ELBO (up to a constant); and the ELBO is equal to the marginal likelihood
with a deterministic recognition model. Thus, we argue that our VAE perspective
gives a better motivation for InfoNCE than MI, as the actual InfoNCE objective
is only loosely bounded by the MI, but is equal to the ELBO/marginal likelihood
(up to a constant).</span>

outcome. Machine learning frameworks that integrate uncertainty estimation as
part of their treatment recommendations would be safer and more reliable.
However, little work has been done in adapting uncertainty estimation
techniques and validation metrics for precision medicine. In this paper, we use
Bayesian deep learning for estimating the posterior distribution over factual

the uncertainty for each treatment option and for the individual treatment
effects (ITE) between any two treatments. We train and evaluate this model to
predict future new and enlarging T2 lesion counts on a large, multi-center
dataset of MR brain images of patients with multiple sclerosis, exposed to
several treatments during randomized controlled trials. We evaluate the
correlation of the uncertainty estimate with the factual error, and, given the
lack of ground truth counterfactual outcomes, demonstrate how uncertainty for
the ITE prediction relates to bounds on the ITE error. Lastly, we demonstrate
how knowledge of uncertainty could modify clinical decision-making to improve

                              <span>Quality-Diversity (QD) methods are algorithms that aim to generate a set of
diverse and high-performing solutions to a given problem. Originally developed
for evolutionary robotics, most QD studies are conducted on a limited set of
domains - mainly applied to locomotion, where the fitness and the behavior
signal are dense. Grasping is a crucial task for manipulation in robotics.
Despite the efforts of many research communities, this task is yet to be
solved. Grasping cumulates unprecedented challenges in QD literature: it
suffers from reward sparsity, behavioral sparsity, and behavior space
misalignment. The present work studies how QD can address grasping. Experiments
have been conducted on 15 different methods on 10 grasping domains,
corresponding to 2 different robot-gripper setups and 5 standard objects. An
evaluation framework that distinguishes the evaluation of an algorithm from its
internal components has also been proposed for a fair comparison. The obtained
results show that MAP-Elites variants that select successful solutions in
priority outperform all the compared methods on the studied metrics by a large
margin. We also found experimental evidence that sparse interaction can lead to
deceptive novelty. To our knowledge, the ability to efficiently produce

                              <span>Gradient-based optimization is now ubiquitous across graphics, but
unfortunately can not be applied to problems with undefined or zero gradients.
To circumvent this issue, the loss function can be manually replaced by a
&quot;surrogate&quot; that has similar minima but is differentiable. Our proposed
framework, ZeroGrads, automates this process by learning a neural approximation
of the objective function, the surrogate, which in turn can be used to
differentiate through arbitrary black-box graphics pipelines. We train the
surrogate on an actively smoothed version of the objective and encourage
locality, focusing the surrogate&#x27;s capacity on what matters at the current
training episode. The fitting is performed online, alongside the parameter
optimization, and self-supervised, without pre-computed data or pre-trained
models. As sampling the objective is expensive (it requires a full rendering or
simulator run), we devise an efficient sampling scheme that allows for
tractable run-times and competitive performance at little overhead. We
demonstrate optimizing diverse non-convex, non-differentiable black-box
problems in graphics, such as visibility in rendering, discrete parameter
spaces in procedural modelling or optimal control in physics-driven animation.
In contrast to more traditional algorithms, our approach scales well to higher
dimensions, which we demonstrate on problems with up to 35k interlinked

tasks, but their computation-intensive nature demands faster and more
energy-efficient hardware implementations. Optics-based platforms, using
technologies such as silicon photonics and spatial light modulators, offer
promising avenues for achieving this goal. However, training multiple trainable
layers in tandem with these physical systems poses challenges, as they are
difficult to fully characterize and describe with differentiable functions,
hindering the use of error backpropagation algorithm. The recently introduced
Forward-Forward Algorithm (FFA) eliminates the need for perfect
characterization of the learning system and shows promise for efficient
training with large numbers of programmable parameters. The FFA does not
require backpropagating an error signal to update the weights, rather the
weights are updated by only sending information in one direction. The local
loss function for each set of trainable weights enables low-power analog
hardware implementations without resorting to metaheuristic algorithms or
reinforcement learning. In this paper, we present an experiment utilizing
multimode nonlinear wave propagation in an optical fiber demonstrating the
feasibility of the FFA approach using an optical system. The results show that
incorporating optical transforms in multilayer NN architectures trained with

                              <span>We present a robust deep incremental learning framework for regression tasks
on financial temporal tabular datasets which is built upon the incremental use
of commonly available tabular and time series prediction models to adapt to
distributional shifts typical of financial datasets. The framework uses a
simple basic building block (decision trees) to build self-similar models of
any required complexity to deliver robust performance under adverse situations
such as regime changes, fat-tailed distributions, and low signal-to-noise
ratios. As a detailed study, we demonstrate our scheme using XGBoost models
trained on the Numerai dataset and show that a two layer deep ensemble of
XGBoost models over different model snapshots delivers high quality predictions
under different market regimes. We also show that the performance of XGBoost
models with different number of boosting rounds in three scenarios (small,
standard and large) is monotonically increasing with respect to model size and
converges towards the generalisation upper bound. We also evaluate the
robustness of the model under variability of different hyperparameters, such as
model complexity and data sampling settings. Our model has low hardware
requirements as no specialised neural architectures are used and each base
model can be independently trained in parallel.</span>

independently of their position. If the data is generated by some smooth

new class of neural networks that are shift invariant and preserve smoothness

                              <span>We propose an efficient distributed out-of-memory implementation of the
Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) algorithm for heterogeneous
high-performance-computing (HPC) systems. The proposed implementation is based
on prior work on NMFk, which can perform automatic model selection and extract
latent variables and patterns from data. In this work, we extend NMFk by adding
support for dense and sparse matrix operation on multi-node, multi-GPU systems.
The resulting algorithm is optimized for out-of-memory (OOM) problems where the
memory required to factorize a given matrix is greater than the available GPU
memory. Memory complexity is reduced by batching/tiling strategies, and sparse
and dense matrix operations are significantly accelerated with GPU cores (or
tensor cores when available). Input/Output (I/O) latency associated with batch
copies between host and device is hidden using CUDA streams to overlap data
transfers and compute asynchronously, and latency associated with collective
communications (both intra-node and inter-node) is reduced using optimized
NVIDIA Collective Communication Library NCCL based communicators. Benchmark
results show significant improvement, from 32X to 76x speedup, with the new
implementation using GPUs over the CPU-based NMFk. Good weak scaling was
demonstrated on up to 4096 multi-GPU cluster nodes with approximately 25,000
GPUs when decomposing a dense 340 Terabyte-size matrix and an 11 Exabyte-size
sparse matrix of density 10e-6.</span>

                              <span>Node classification is the task of predicting the labels of unlabeled nodes
in a graph. State-of-the-art methods based on graph neural networks achieve
excellent performance when all labels are available during training. But in
real-life, models are often applied on data with new classes, which can lead to
massive misclassification and thus significantly degrade performance. Hence,
developing open-set classification methods is crucial to determine if a given
sample belongs to a known class. Existing methods for open-set node
classification generally use transductive learning with part or all of the
features of real unseen class nodes to help with open-set classification. In
this paper, we propose a novel generative open-set node classification method,
i.e. $\mathcal{G}^2Pxy$, which follows a stricter inductive learning setting
where no information about unknown classes is available during training and
validation. Two kinds of proxy unknown nodes, inter-class unknown proxies and
external unknown proxies are generated via mixup to efficiently anticipate the
distribution of novel classes. Using the generated proxies, a closed-set
classifier can be transformed into an open-set one, by augmenting it with an
extra proxy classifier. Under the constraints of both cross entropy loss and
complement entropy loss, $\mathcal{G}^2Pxy$ achieves superior effectiveness for
unknown class detection and known class classification, which is validated by
experiments on benchmark graph datasets. Moreover, $\mathcal{G}^2Pxy$ does not
have specific requirement on the GNN architecture and shows good
generalizations.</span>

                              <span>Automated medical report generation has become increasingly important in
medical analysis. It can produce computer-aided diagnosis descriptions and thus
significantly alleviate the doctors&#x27; work. Inspired by the huge success of
neural machine translation and image captioning, various deep learning methods
have been proposed for medical report generation. However, due to the inherent
properties of medical data, including data imbalance and the length and
correlation between report sequences, the generated reports by existing methods
may exhibit linguistic fluency but lack adequate clinical accuracy. In this
work, we propose an image-to-indicator hierarchical transformer (IIHT)
framework for medical report generation. It consists of three modules, i.e., a
classifier module, an indicator expansion module and a generator module. The
classifier module first extracts image features from the input medical images
and produces disease-related indicators with their corresponding states. The
disease-related indicators are subsequently utilised as input for the indicator
expansion module, incorporating the &quot;data-text-data&quot; strategy. The
transformer-based generator then leverages these extracted features along with
image features as auxiliary information to generate final reports. Furthermore,
the proposed IIHT method is feasible for radiologists to modify disease
indicators in real-world scenarios and integrate the operations into the
indicator expansion module for fluent and accurate medical report generation.
Extensive experiments and comparisons with state-of-the-art methods under
various evaluation metrics demonstrate the great performance of the proposed
method.</span>

                              <span>Ensuring alignment, which refers to making models behave in accordance with
human intentions [1,2], has become a critical task before deploying large
language models (LLMs) in real-world applications. For instance, OpenAI devoted
six months to iteratively aligning GPT-4 before its release [3]. However, a
major challenge faced by practitioners is the lack of clear guidance on
evaluating whether LLM outputs align with social norms, values, and
regulations. This obstacle hinders systematic iteration and deployment of LLMs.
To address this issue, this paper presents a comprehensive survey of key
dimensions that are crucial to consider when assessing LLM trustworthiness. The
survey covers seven major categories of LLM trustworthiness: reliability,
safety, fairness, resistance to misuse, explainability and reasoning, adherence
to social norms, and robustness. Each major category is further divided into
several sub-categories, resulting in a total of 29 sub-categories.
Additionally, a subset of 8 sub-categories is selected for further
investigation, where corresponding measurement studies are designed and
conducted on several widely-used LLMs. The measurement results indicate that,
in general, more aligned models tend to perform better in terms of overall
trustworthiness. However, the effectiveness of alignment varies across the
different trustworthiness categories considered. This highlights the importance
of conducting more fine-grained analyses, testing, and making continuous
improvements on LLM alignment. By shedding light on these key dimensions of LLM
trustworthiness, this paper aims to provide valuable insights and guidance to
practitioners in the field. Understanding and addressing these concerns will be
crucial in achieving reliable and ethically sound deployment of LLMs in various
applications.</span>

samples is crucial in real-world safety demanding applications. In this work we
first study the interplay between critical points of 3D point clouds and OOD
samples. Our findings are that common corruptions and outliers are often
interpreted as critical points. We generalize the notion of critical points
into importance measures. We show that training a classification network based
only on less important points dramatically improves robustness, at a cost of
minor performance loss on the clean set. We observe that normalized entropy is
highly informative for corruption analysis. An adaptive threshold based on
normalized entropy is suggested for selecting the set of uncritical points. Our
proposed importance measure is extremely fast to compute. We show it can be
used for a variety of applications, such as Explainable AI (XAI), Outlier
Removal, Uncertainty Estimation, Robust Classification and Adversarial Defense.

                              <span>Artificial Intelligence in Medicine has made significant progress with
emerging applications in medical imaging, patient care, and other areas. While
these applications have proven successful in retrospective studies, very few of
them were applied in practice.The field of Medical AI faces various challenges,
in terms of building user trust, complying with regulations, using data
ethically.Explainable AI (XAI) aims to enable humans understand AI and trust
its results. This paper presents a literature review on the recent developments
of XAI solutions for medical decision support, based on a representative sample
of 198 articles published in recent years. The systematic synthesis of the
relevant articles resulted in several findings. (1) model-agnostic XAI
techniques were mostly employed in these solutions, (2) deep learning models
are utilized more than other types of machine learning models, (3)
explainability was applied to promote trust, but very few works reported the
physicians participation in the loop, (4) visual and interactive user interface
is more useful in understanding the explanation and the recommendation of the
system. More research is needed in collaboration between medical and AI
experts, that could guide the development of suitable frameworks for the
design, implementation, and evaluation of XAI solutions in medicine.</span>

                              <span>With a rapidly increasing amount and diversity of remote sensing (RS) data
sources, there is a strong need for multi-view learning modeling. This is a
complex task when considering the differences in resolution, magnitude, and
noise of RS data. The typical approach for merging multiple RS sources has been
input-level fusion, but other - more advanced - fusion strategies may
outperform this traditional approach. This work assesses different fusion
strategies for crop classification in the CropHarvest dataset. The fusion
methods proposed in this work outperform models based on individual views and
previous fusion methods. We do not find one single fusion method that
consistently outperforms all other approaches. Instead, we present a comparison
of multi-view fusion methods for three different datasets and show that,
depending on the test region, different methods obtain the best performance.
Despite this, we suggest a preliminary criterion for the selection of fusion
methods.</span>

approaches for deceptive text classification. We investigate the effectiveness
of traditional machine learning algorithms and state-of-the-art transformer

                              <span>Deep learning classifiers achieve state-of-the-art performance in various
risk detection applications. They explore rich semantic representations and are
supposed to automatically discover risk behaviors. However, due to the lack of
transparency, the behavioral semantics cannot be conveyed to downstream
security experts to reduce their heavy workload in security analysis. Although
feature attribution (FA) methods can be used to explain deep learning, the
underlying classifier is still blind to what behavior is suspicious, and the
generated explanation cannot adapt to downstream tasks, incurring poor
explanation fidelity and intelligibility. In this paper, we propose FINER, the
first framework for risk detection classifiers to generate high-fidelity and
high-intelligibility explanations. The high-level idea is to gather explanation
efforts from model developer, FA designer, and security experts. To improve
fidelity, we fine-tune the classifier with an explanation-guided multi-task
learning strategy. To improve intelligibility, we engage task knowledge to
adjust and ensemble FA methods. Extensive evaluations show that FINER improves
explanation quality for risk detection. Moreover, we demonstrate that FINER
outperforms a state-of-the-art tool in facilitating malware analysis.</span>

                              <span>Environmental perception is a key element of autonomous driving because the
information received from the perception module influences core driving
decisions. An outstanding challenge in real-time perception for autonomous
driving lies in finding the best trade-off between detection quality and
latency. Major constraints on both computation and power have to be taken into
account for real-time perception in autonomous vehicles. Larger object
detection models tend to produce the best results, but are also slower at
runtime. Since the most accurate detectors cannot run in real-time locally, we
investigate the possibility of offloading computation to edge and cloud
platforms, which are less resource-constrained. We create a synthetic dataset
to train object detection models and evaluate different offloading strategies.
Using real hardware and network simulations, we compare different trade-offs
between prediction quality and end-to-end delay. Since sending raw frames over
the network implies additional transmission delays, we also explore the use of
JPEG and H.265 compression at varying qualities and measure their impact on
prediction metrics. We show that models with adequate compression can be run in
real-time on the cloud while outperforming local detection performance.</span>

breakthroughs like AlphaFold2 that use transformers to attend directly over
large quantities of raw MSAs have reaffirmed their importance. Generation of

million MSAs, associated structural homologs from the Protein Data Bank, and
AlphaFold2 protein structure predictions. We have previously demonstrated the

essential for emerging technologies like autonomous driving, the Internet of

systems is Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), which demand high
computational resources. This requirement has led to the use of ML accelerators

approaches to expedite the DSE process by identifying the most appropriate
GPGPU for CNN inferencing systems. We have developed a quick and precise
technique for forecasting the power and performance of CNNs during inference,
with a MAPE of 5.03% and 5.94%, respectively. Our approach empowers computer

                              <span>This work considers gradient-based mesh optimization, where we iteratively
optimize for a 3D surface mesh by representing it as the isosurface of a scalar
field, an increasingly common paradigm in applications including
photogrammetry, generative modeling, and inverse physics. Existing
implementations adapt classic isosurface extraction algorithms like Marching
Cubes or Dual Contouring; these techniques were designed to extract meshes from
fixed, known fields, and in the optimization setting they lack the degrees of
freedom to represent high-quality feature-preserving meshes, or suffer from
numerical instabilities. We introduce FlexiCubes, an isosurface representation
specifically designed for optimizing an unknown mesh with respect to geometric,
visual, or even physical objectives. Our main insight is to introduce
additional carefully-chosen parameters into the representation, which allow
local flexible adjustments to the extracted mesh geometry and connectivity.
These parameters are updated along with the underlying scalar field via
automatic differentiation when optimizing for a downstream task. We base our
extraction scheme on Dual Marching Cubes for improved topological properties,
and present extensions to optionally generate tetrahedral and
hierarchically-adaptive meshes. Extensive experiments validate FlexiCubes on
both synthetic benchmarks and real-world applications, showing that it offers
significant improvements in mesh quality and geometric fidelity.</span>

                              <span>Optics is an exciting route for the next generation of computing hardware for
machine learning, promising several orders of magnitude enhancement in both
computational speed and energy efficiency. However, to reach the full capacity
of an optical neural network it is necessary that the computing not only for
the inference, but also for the training be implemented optically. The primary
algorithm for training a neural network is backpropagation, in which the
calculation is performed in the order opposite to the information flow for
inference. While straightforward in a digital computer, optical implementation
of backpropagation has so far remained elusive, particularly because of the
conflicting requirements for the optical element that implements the nonlinear
activation function. In this work, we address this challenge for the first time
with a surprisingly simple and generic scheme. Saturable absorbers are employed
for the role of the activation units, and the required properties are achieved
through a pump-probe process, in which the forward propagating signal acts as
the pump and backward as the probe. Our approach is adaptable to various analog
platforms, materials, and network structures, and it demonstrates the
possibility of constructing neural networks entirely reliant on analog optical
processes for both training and inference tasks.</span>

                              <span>Several architecture frameworks for software, systems, and enterprises have
been proposed in the literature. They identified various stakeholders and
defined architecture viewpoints and views to frame and address stakeholder
concerns. However, the stakeholders with data science and Machine Learning (ML)
related concerns, such as data scientists and data engineers, are yet to be
included in existing architecture frameworks. Therefore, they failed to address
the architecture viewpoints and views responsive to the concerns of the data
science community. In this paper, we address this gap by establishing the
architecture frameworks adapted to meet the requirements of modern applications
and organizations where ML artifacts are both prevalent and crucial. In
particular, we focus on ML-enabled Cyber-Physical Systems (CPSs) and propose
two sets of merit criteria for their efficient development and performance
assessment, namely the criteria for evaluating and benchmarking ML-enabled
CPSs, and the criteria for evaluation and benchmarking of the tools intended to
support users through the modeling and development pipeline. In this study, we
deploy multiple empirical and qualitative research methods based on literature
review and survey instruments including expert interviews and an online
questionnaire. We collect, analyze, and integrate the opinions of 77 experts
from more than 25 organizations in over 10 countries to devise and validate the
proposed framework.</span>

                              <span>Graph clustering is a fundamental task in graph analysis, and recent advances
in utilizing graph neural networks (GNNs) have shown impressive results.
Despite the success of existing GNN-based graph clustering methods, they often
overlook the quality of graph structure, which is inherent in real-world graphs
due to their sparse and multifarious nature, leading to subpar performance.
Graph structure learning allows refining the input graph by adding missing
links and removing spurious connections. However, previous endeavors in graph
structure learning have predominantly centered around supervised settings, and
cannot be directly applied to our specific clustering tasks due to the absence
of ground-truth labels. To bridge the gap, we propose a novel method called
\textbf{ho}mophily-enhanced structure \textbf{le}arning for graph clustering
(HoLe). Our motivation stems from the observation that subtly enhancing the
degree of homophily within the graph structure can significantly improve GNNs
and clustering outcomes. To realize this objective, we develop two
clustering-oriented structure learning modules, i.e., hierarchical correlation
estimation and cluster-aware sparsification. The former module enables a more
accurate estimation of pairwise node relationships by leveraging guidance from
latent and clustering spaces, while the latter one generates a sparsified
structure based on the similarity matrix and clustering assignments.
Additionally, we devise a joint optimization approach alternating between
training the homophily-enhanced structure learning and GNN-based clustering,
thereby enforcing their reciprocal effects. Extensive experiments on seven
benchmark datasets of various types and scales, across a range of clustering
metrics, demonstrate the superiority of HoLe against state-of-the-art
baselines.</span>

                              <span>Recently, methods for skeleton-based human activity recognition have been
shown to be vulnerable to adversarial attacks. However, these attack methods
require either the full knowledge of the victim (i.e. white-box attacks),
access to training data (i.e. transfer-based attacks) or frequent model queries
(i.e. black-box attacks). All their requirements are highly restrictive,
raising the question of how detrimental the vulnerability is. In this paper, we
show that the vulnerability indeed exists. To this end, we consider a new
attack task: the attacker has no access to the victim model or the training
data or labels, where we coin the term hard no-box attack. Specifically, we
first learn a motion manifold where we define an adversarial loss to compute a
new gradient for the attack, named skeleton-motion-informed (SMI) gradient. Our
gradient contains information of the motion dynamics, which is different from
existing gradient-based attack methods that compute the loss gradient assuming
each dimension in the data is independent. The SMI gradient can augment many
gradient-based attack methods, leading to a new family of no-box attack
methods. Extensive evaluation and comparison show that our method imposes a
real threat to existing classifiers. They also show that the SMI gradient
improves the transferability and imperceptibility of adversarial samples in
both no-box and transfer-based black-box settings.</span>

                              <span>Automated driving has the potential to revolutionize personal, public, and
freight mobility. Besides the enormous challenge of perception, i.e. accurately
perceiving the environment using available sensor data, automated driving
comprises planning a safe, comfortable, and efficient motion trajectory. To
promote safety and progress, many works rely on modules that predict the future
motion of surrounding traffic. Modular automated driving systems commonly
handle prediction and planning as sequential separate tasks. While this
accounts for the influence of surrounding traffic on the ego-vehicle, it fails
to anticipate the reactions of traffic participants to the ego-vehicle&#x27;s
behavior. Recent works suggest that integrating prediction and planning in an
interdependent joint step is necessary to achieve safe, efficient, and
comfortable driving. While various models implement such integrated systems, a
comprehensive overview and theoretical understanding of different principles
are lacking. We systematically review state-of-the-art deep learning-based
prediction, planning, and integrated prediction and planning models. Different
facets of the integration ranging from model architecture and model design to
behavioral aspects are considered and related to each other. Moreover, we
discuss the implications, strengths, and limitations of different integration
methods. By pointing out research gaps, describing relevant future challenges,

significant demand for the diversity of traversable environments and the
quantity of supervision for training generalizable agents. To tackle the common
data scarcity issue in existing vision-and-language navigation datasets, we
propose an effective paradigm for generating large-scale data for learning,
which applies 1200+ photo-realistic environments from HM3D and Gibson datasets
and synthesizes 4.9 million instruction trajectory pairs using fully-accessible
resources on the web. Importantly, we investigate the influence of each
component in this paradigm on the agent&#x27;s performance and study how to
adequately apply the augmented data to pre-train and fine-tune an agent. Thanks
to our large-scale dataset, the performance of an existing agent can be pushed
up (+11% absolute with regard to previous SoTA) to a significantly new best of
80% single-run success rate on the R2R test split by simple imitation learning.
The long-lasting generalization gap between navigating in seen and unseen
environments is also reduced to less than 1% (versus 8% in the previous best
method). Moreover, our paradigm also facilitates different models to achieve
new state-of-the-art navigation results on CVDN, REVERIE, and R2R in continuous

                              <span>Retrosynthesis consists of breaking down a chemical compound recursively
step-by-step into molecular precursors until a set of commercially available
molecules is found with the goal to provide a synthesis route. Its two primary
research directions, single-step retrosynthesis prediction, which models the
chemical reaction logic, and multi-step synthesis planning, which tries to find
the correct sequence of reactions, are inherently intertwined. Still, this
connection is not reflected in contemporary research. In this work, we combine
these two major research directions by applying multiple single-step
retrosynthesis models within multi-step synthesis planning and analyzing their
impact using public and proprietary reaction data. We find a disconnection
between high single-step performance and potential route-finding success,
suggesting that single-step models must be evaluated within synthesis planning
in the future. Furthermore, we show that the commonly used single-step
retrosynthesis benchmark dataset USPTO-50k is insufficient as this evaluation
task does not represent model performance and scalability on larger and more
diverse datasets. For multi-step synthesis planning, we show that the choice of
the single-step model can improve the overall success rate of synthesis
planning by up to +28% compared to the commonly used baseline model. Finally,
we show that each single-step model finds unique synthesis routes, and differs
in aspects such as route-finding success, the number of found synthesis routes,
and chemical validity, making the combination of single-step retrosynthesis
prediction and multi-step synthesis planning a crucial aspect when developing
future methods.</span>

                              <span>The connection between Residual Neural Networks (ResNets) and continuous-time
control systems (known as NeurODEs) has led to a mathematical analysis of
neural networks which has provided interesting results of both theoretical and
practical significance. However, by construction, NeurODEs have been limited to
describing constant-width layers, making them unsuitable for modeling deep
learning architectures with layers of variable width. In this paper, we propose
a continuous-time Autoencoder, which we call AutoencODE, based on a
modification of the controlled field that drives the dynamics. This adaptation
enables the extension of the mean-field control framework originally devised
for conventional NeurODEs. In this setting, we tackle the case of low Tikhonov
regularization, resulting in potentially non-convex cost landscapes. While the
global results obtained for high Tikhonov regularization may not hold globally,
we show that many of them can be recovered in regions where the loss function
is locally convex. Inspired by our theoretical findings, we develop a training
method tailored to this specific type of Autoencoders with residual
connections, and we validate our approach through numerical experiments
conducted on various examples.</span>

                              <span>Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) for 3D point cloud recognition are vulnerable to
adversarial examples, threatening their practical deployment. Despite the many
research endeavors have been made to tackle this issue in recent years, the
diversity of adversarial examples on 3D point clouds makes them more
challenging to defend against than those on 2D images. For examples, attackers
can generate adversarial examples by adding, shifting, or removing points.
Consequently, existing defense strategies are hard to counter unseen point
cloud adversarial examples. In this paper, we first establish a comprehensive,
and rigorous point cloud adversarial robustness benchmark to evaluate
adversarial robustness, which can provide a detailed understanding of the
effects of the defense and attack methods. We then collect existing defense
tricks in point cloud adversarial defenses and then perform extensive and
systematic experiments to identify an effective combination of these tricks.
Furthermore, we propose a hybrid training augmentation methods that consider
various types of point cloud adversarial examples to adversarial training,
significantly improving the adversarial robustness. By combining these tricks,
we construct a more robust defense framework achieving an average accuracy of
83.45\% against various attacks, demonstrating its capability to enabling
robust learners. Our codebase are open-sourced on:

                              <span>The task of retrieving already debunked narratives aims to detect stories
that have already been fact-checked. The successful detection of claims that
have already been debunked not only reduces the manual efforts of professional
fact-checkers but can also contribute to slowing the spread of misinformation.
Mainly due to the lack of readily available data, this is an understudied
problem, particularly when considering the cross-lingual task, i.e. the
retrieval of fact-checking articles in a language different from the language
of the online post being checked. This paper fills this gap by (i) creating a
novel dataset to enable research on cross-lingual retrieval of already debunked
narratives, using tweets as queries to a database of fact-checking articles;
(ii) presenting an extensive experiment to benchmark fine-tuned and
off-the-shelf multilingual pre-trained Transformer models for this task; and
(iii) proposing a novel multistage framework that divides this cross-lingual
debunk retrieval task into refinement and re-ranking stages. Results show that
the task of cross-lingual retrieval of already debunked narratives is
challenging and off-the-shelf Transformer models fail to outperform a strong
lexical-based baseline (BM25). Nevertheless, our multistage retrieval framework
is robust, outperforming BM25 in most scenarios and enabling cross-domain and
zero-shot learning, without significantly harming the model&#x27;s performance.</span>

                              <span>Surgical instrument segmentation is recognised as a key enabler to provide
advanced surgical assistance and improve computer assisted interventions. In
this work, we propose SegMatch, a semi supervised learning method to reduce the
need for expensive annotation for laparoscopic and robotic surgical images.
SegMatch builds on FixMatch, a widespread semi supervised classification
pipeline combining consistency regularization and pseudo labelling, and adapts
it for the purpose of segmentation. In our proposed SegMatch, the unlabelled
images are weakly augmented and fed into the segmentation model to generate a
pseudo-label to enforce the unsupervised loss against the output of the model
for the adversarial augmented image on the pixels with a high confidence score.
Our adaptation for segmentation tasks includes carefully considering the
equivariance and invariance properties of the augmentation functions we rely
on. To increase the relevance of our augmentations, we depart from using only
handcrafted augmentations and introduce a trainable adversarial augmentation
strategy. Our algorithm was evaluated on the MICCAI Instrument Segmentation
Challenge datasets Robust-MIS 2019 and EndoVis 2017. Our results demonstrate
that adding unlabelled data for training purposes allows us to surpass the
performance of fully supervised approaches which are limited by the
availability of training data in these challenges. SegMatch also outperforms a
range of state-of-the-art semi-supervised learning semantic segmentation models
in different labelled to unlabelled data ratios.</span>

prediction is evaluated alongside the constant velocity model (CVM) with
respect to its applicability in autonomous vehicles. The evaluation is
conducted on the widely-used ETH/UCY dataset where the Average Displacement
Error (ADE) and the Final Displacement Error (FDE) are reported. To align with
requirements in real-world applications, modifications are made to the input
features of the initially proposed models. An ablation study is conducted to
examine the influence of the observed motion history on the prediction
performance, thereby establishing a better understanding of its impact.
Additionally, the inference time of each model is measured to evaluate the
scalability of each model when confronted with varying amounts of agents. The
results demonstrate that simple models remain competitive when generating
single trajectories, and certain features commonly thought of as useful have
little impact on the overall performance across different architectures. Based
on these findings, recommendations are proposed to guide the future development

                              <span>Large skew-t factor copula models are attractive for the modeling of
financial data because they allow for asymmetric and extreme tail dependence.
We show that the copula implicit in the skew-t distribution of Azzalini and
Capitanio (2003) allows for a higher level of pairwise asymmetric dependence
than two popular alternative skew-t copulas. Estimation of this copula in high
dimensions is challenging, and we propose a fast and accurate Bayesian
variational inference (VI) approach to do so. The method uses a conditionally
Gaussian generative representation of the skew-t distribution to define an
augmented posterior that can be approximated accurately. A fast stochastic
gradient ascent algorithm is used to solve the variational optimization. The
new methodology is used to estimate copula models for intraday returns from
2017 to 2021 on 93 U.S. equities. The copula captures substantial heterogeneity
in asymmetric dependence over equity pairs, in addition to the variability in
pairwise correlations. We show that intraday predictive densities from the
skew-t copula are more accurate than from some other copula models, while
portfolio selection strategies based on the estimated pairwise tail
dependencies improve performance relative to the benchmark index.</span>

both classification accuracy of the learnt model as well as the number of bits

trade-off by designing a privacy-aware compression mechanism, called the

learning models may be necessary to maintain or improve performance over time.
However, updating a model can introduce compatibility issues when the behavior
of the updated model does not align with user expectations, resulting in poor
user-model team performance. Existing compatibility measures depend on model
decision thresholds, limiting their applicability in settings where models are
used to generate rankings based on estimated risk. To address this limitation,
we propose a novel rank-based compatibility measure, $C^R$, and a new loss
function that aims to optimize discriminative performance while encouraging
good compatibility. Applied to a case study in mortality risk stratification
leveraging data from MIMIC, our approach yields more compatible models while
maintaining discriminative performance compared to existing model selection
techniques, with an increase in $C^R$ of $0.019$ ($95\%$ confidence interval:

                              <span>Reinforcement Learning (RL), bolstered by the expressive capabilities of Deep
Neural Networks (DNNs) for function approximation, has demonstrated
considerable success in numerous applications. However, its practicality in
addressing various real-world scenarios, characterized by diverse and
unpredictable dynamics, noisy signals, and large state and action spaces,
remains limited. This limitation stems from issues such as poor data
efficiency, limited generalization capabilities, a lack of safety guarantees,
and the absence of interpretability, among other factors. To overcome these
challenges and improve performance across these crucial metrics, one promising
avenue is to incorporate additional structural information about the problem
into the RL learning process. Various sub-fields of RL have proposed methods
for incorporating such inductive biases. We amalgamate these diverse
methodologies under a unified framework, shedding light on the role of
structure in the learning problem, and classify these methods into distinct
patterns of incorporating structure. By leveraging this comprehensive
framework, we provide valuable insights into the challenges of structured RL
and lay the groundwork for a design pattern perspective on RL research. This
novel perspective paves the way for future advancements and aids in developing
more effective and efficient RL algorithms that can potentially handle
real-world scenarios better.</span>

based, not on text, but on low bitrate discrete units that have been learned in
a self-supervised fashion and can therefore capture expressive aspects of
speech that are hard to transcribe (prosody, voice styles, non-verbal
vocalization). The adoption of these methods is still limited by the fact that
most speech synthesis datasets are read, severely limiting spontaneity and
expressivity. Here, we introduce Expresso, a high-quality expressive speech
dataset for textless speech synthesis that includes both read speech and
improvised dialogues rendered in 26 spontaneous expressive styles. We
illustrate the challenges and potentials of this dataset with an expressive
resynthesis benchmark where the task is to encode the input in low-bitrate
units and resynthesize it in a target voice while preserving content and style.
We evaluate resynthesis quality with automatic metrics for different
self-supervised discrete encoders, and explore tradeoffs between quality,
bitrate and invariance to speaker and style. All the dataset, evaluation

                              <span>The decentralized and privacy-preserving nature of federated learning (FL)
makes it vulnerable to backdoor attacks aiming to manipulate the behavior of
the resulting model on specific adversary-chosen inputs. However, most existing
defenses based on statistical differences take effect only against specific
attacks, especially when the malicious gradients are similar to benign ones or
the data are highly non-independent and identically distributed (non-IID). In
this paper, we revisit the distance-based defense methods and discover that i)
Euclidean distance becomes meaningless in high dimensions and ii) malicious
gradients with diverse characteristics cannot be identified by a single metric.
To this end, we present a simple yet effective defense strategy with
multi-metrics and dynamic weighting to identify backdoors adaptively.
Furthermore, our novel defense has no reliance on predefined assumptions over
attack settings or data distributions and little impact on benign performance.
To evaluate the effectiveness of our approach, we conduct comprehensive
experiments on different datasets under various attack settings, where our
method achieves the best defensive performance. For instance, we achieve the
lowest backdoor accuracy of 3.06% under the difficult Edge-case PGD, showing
significant superiority over previous defenses. The results also demonstrate
that our method can be well-adapted to a wide range of non-IID degrees without
sacrificing the benign performance.</span>

                              <span>In recent years, heterogeneous graph few-shot learning has been proposed to
address the label sparsity issue in heterogeneous graphs (HGs), which contain
various types of nodes and edges. The existing methods have achieved good
performance by transferring generalized knowledge extracted from rich-labeled
classes in source HG(s) to few-labeled classes in a target HG. However, these
methods only consider the single-heterogeneity scenario where the source and
target HGs share a fixed set of node/edge types, ignoring the more general
scenario of cross-heterogeneity, where each HG can have a different and
non-fixed set of node/edge types. To this end, we focus on the unexplored
cross-heterogeneity scenario and propose a novel model for Cross-heterogeneity
Graph Few-shot Learning, namely CGFL. In CGFL, we first extract meta-patterns
to capture heterogeneous information and propose a multi-view heterogeneous
graph neural network (MHGN) to learn meta-patterns across HGs. Then, we propose
a score module to measure the informativeness of labeled samples and determine
the transferability of each source HG. Finally, by integrating MHGN and the
score module into a meta-learning mechanism, CGFL can effectively transfer
generalized knowledge to predict new classes with few-labeled data. Extensive
experiments on four real-world datasets have demonstrated the superior
performance of CGFL over the state-of-the-art methods.</span>

                              <span>This paper studies Byzantine-robust stochastic optimization over a
decentralized network, where every agent periodically communicates with its
neighbors to exchange local models, and then updates its own local model by
stochastic gradient descent (SGD). The performance of such a method is affected
by an unknown number of Byzantine agents, which conduct adversarially during
the optimization process. To the best of our knowledge, there is no existing
work that simultaneously achieves a linear convergence speed and a small
learning error. We observe that the learning error is largely dependent on the
intrinsic stochastic gradient noise. Motivated by this observation, we
introduce two variance reduction methods, stochastic average gradient algorithm
(SAGA) and loopless stochastic variance-reduced gradient (LSVRG), to
Byzantine-robust decentralized stochastic optimization for eliminating the
negative effect of the stochastic gradient noise. The two resulting methods,
BRAVO-SAGA and BRAVO-LSVRG, enjoy both linear convergence speeds and stochastic
gradient noise-independent learning errors. Such learning errors are optimal
for a class of methods based on total variation (TV)-norm regularization and
stochastic subgradient update. We conduct extensive numerical experiments to

                              <span>Causal inference is a crucial goal of science, enabling researchers to arrive
at meaningful conclusions regarding the predictions of hypothetical
interventions using observational data. Path models, Structural Equation Models
(SEMs), and, more generally, Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs), provide a means to
unambiguously specify assumptions regarding the causal structure underlying a
phenomenon. Unlike DAGs, which make very few assumptions about the functional
and parametric form, SEM assumes linearity. This can result in functional
misspecification which prevents researchers from undertaking reliable effect
size estimation. In contrast, we propose Super Learner Equation Modeling, a
path modeling technique integrating machine learning Super Learner ensembles.
We empirically demonstrate its ability to provide consistent and unbiased
estimates of causal effects, its competitive performance for linear models when
compared with SEM, and highlight its superiority over SEM when dealing with
non-linear relationships. We provide open-source code, and a tutorial notebook
with example usage, accentuating the easy-to-use nature of the method.</span>

                              <span>The recent proliferation of 3D content that can be consumed on hand-held
devices necessitates efficient tools for transmitting large geometric data,
e.g., 3D meshes, over the Internet. Detailed high-resolution assets can pose a
challenge to storage as well as transmission bandwidth, and level-of-detail
techniques are often used to transmit an asset using an appropriate bandwidth
budget. It is especially desirable for these methods to transmit data
progressively, improving the quality of the geometry with more data. Our key
insight is that the geometric details of 3D meshes often exhibit similar local
patterns even across different shapes, and thus can be effectively represented
with a shared learned generative space. We learn this space using a
subdivision-based encoder-decoder architecture trained in advance on a large
collection of surfaces. We further observe that additional residual features
can be transmitted progressively between intermediate levels of subdivision
that enable the client to control the tradeoff between bandwidth cost and
quality of reconstruction, providing a neural progressive mesh representation.
We evaluate our method on a diverse set of complex 3D shapes and demonstrate

                              <span>This study proposes a hybrid deep-learning-metaheuristic framework with a
bi-level architecture for road network design problems (NDPs). We train a graph
neural network (GNN) to approximate the solution of the user equilibrium (UE)
traffic assignment problem and use inferences made by the trained model to
calculate fitness function evaluations of a genetic algorithm (GA) to
approximate solutions for NDPs. Using three test networks, two NDP variants and
an exact solver as benchmark, we show that on average, our proposed framework
can provide solutions within 1.5% gap of the best results in less than 0.5% of
the time used by the exact solution procedure. Our framework can be utilized
within an expert system for infrastructure planning to determine the best
infrastructure planning and management decisions under different scenarios.
Given the flexibility of the framework, it can easily be adapted to many other
decision problems that can be modeled as bi-level problems on graphs. Moreover,
we foreseen interesting future research directions, thus we also put forward a
brief research agenda for this topic. The key observation from our research
that can shape future research is that the fitness function evaluation time
using the inferences made by the GNN model was in the order of milliseconds,
which points to an opportunity and a need for novel heuristics that 1) can cope
well with noisy fitness function values provided by deep learning models, and
2) can use the significantly enlarged efficiency of the evaluation step to
explore the search space effectively (rather than efficiently). This opens a
new avenue for a modern class of metaheuristics that are crafted for use with
AI-powered predictors.</span>

                              <span>As the use of machine learning continues to expand, the importance of
ensuring its safety cannot be overstated. A key concern in this regard is the
ability to identify whether a given sample is from the training distribution,
or is an &quot;Out-Of-Distribution&quot; (OOD) sample. In addition, adversaries can
manipulate OOD samples in ways that lead a classifier to make a confident
prediction. In this study, we present a novel approach for certifying the
robustness of OOD detection within a $\ell_2$-norm around the input, regardless
of network architecture and without the need for specific components or
additional training. Further, we improve current techniques for detecting
adversarial attacks on OOD samples, while providing high levels of certified

to overfitted models that underperform under regime changes. In this work, we
propose a modular machine learning pipeline for ranking predictions on temporal
panel datasets which is robust under regime changes. The modularity of the
pipeline allows the use of different models, including Gradient Boosting
Decision Trees (GBDTs) and Neural Networks, with and without feature

robustness and generalisability with reduced complexity and computational cost.
We then demonstrate how online learning techniques, which require no retraining
of models, can be used post-prediction to enhance the results. First, we show
that dynamic feature projection improves robustness by reducing drawdown in
regime changes. Second, we demonstrate that dynamical model ensembling based on
selection of models with good recent performance leads to improved Sharpe and
Calmar ratios of out-of-sample predictions. We also evaluate the robustness of
our pipeline across different data splits and random seeds with good

challenging because, to ensure that the iterates remain on the submanifold, we
often need to solve difficult differential equations. Here, we simplify such
difficulties for a class of sparse or structured symmetric positive-definite
matrices with the affine-invariant metric. We do so by proposing a generalized
version of the Riemannian normal coordinates that dynamically orthonormalizes
the metric and locally converts the problem into an unconstrained problem in
the Euclidean space. We use our approach to simplify existing approaches for
structured covariances and develop matrix-inverse-free $2^\text{nd}$-order
optimizers for deep learning with low precision by using only matrix

                              <span>Inter-city highway transportation is significant for urban life. As one of
the key functions in intelligent transportation system (ITS), traffic
evaluation always plays significant role nowadays, and daily traffic flow
prediction still faces challenges at network-wide toll stations. On the one
hand, the data imbalance in practice among various locations deteriorates the
performance of prediction. On the other hand, complex correlative
spatio-temporal factors cannot be comprehensively employed in long-term
duration. In this paper, a prediction method is proposed for daily traffic flow
in highway domain through spatio-temporal deep learning. In our method, data
normalization strategy is used to deal with data imbalance, due to long-tail
distribution of traffic flow at network-wide toll stations. And then, based on
graph convolutional network, we construct networks in distinct semantics to
capture spatio-temporal features. Beside that, meteorology and calendar
features are used by our model in the full connection stage to extra external
characteristics of traffic flow. By extensive experiments and case studies in
one Chinese provincial highway, our method shows clear improvement in
predictive accuracy than baselines and practical benefits in business.</span>

and optimizing a database system to ensure data availability, performance, and
reliability. However, it is hard and tedious for DBAs to manage a large number

This paper presents a revolutionary LLM-centric framework for database

                              <span>Deep neural network (DNN) deployment has been confined to larger hardware
devices due to their expensive computational requirements. This challenge has
recently reached another scale with the emergence of large language models
(LLMs). In order to reduce both their memory footprint and latency, a promising
technique is quantization. It consists in converting floating point
representations to low bit-width fixed point representations, usually by
assuming a uniform mapping onto a regular grid. This process, referred to in
the literature as uniform quantization, may however be ill-suited as most DNN
weights and activations follow a bell-shaped distribution. This is even worse
on LLMs whose weight distributions are known to exhibit large, high impact,
outlier values. In this work, we propose an improvement over the most commonly
adopted way to tackle this limitation in deep learning models quantization,
namely, non-uniform quantization. NUPES leverages automorphisms to preserve the
scalar multiplications. Such transformations are derived from power functions.
However, the optimization of the exponent parameter and weight values remains a
challenging and novel problem which could not be solved with previous post
training optimization techniques which only learn to round up or down weight
values in order to preserve the predictive function. We circumvent this
limitation with a new paradigm: learning new quantized weights over the entire
quantized space. Similarly, we enable the optimization of the power exponent,
i.e. the optimization of the quantization operator itself during training by
alleviating all the numerical instabilities. The resulting predictive function
is compatible with integer-only low-bit inference. We show the ability of the
method to achieve state-of-the-art compression rates in both, data-free and
data-driven configurations.</span>

researchers start to explore the adoption of LLMs for agile hardware design,
such as generating design RTL based on natural-language instructions. However,
in existing works, their target designs are all relatively simple and in a
small scale, and proposed by the authors themselves, making a fair comparison
among different LLM solutions challenging. In addition, many prior works only
focus on the design correctness, without evaluating the design qualities of
generated design RTL. In this work, we propose an open-source benchmark named
RTLLM, for generating design RTL with natural language instructions. To
systematically evaluate the auto-generated design RTL, we summarized three
progressive goals, named syntax goal, functionality goal, and design quality
goal. This benchmark can automatically provide a quantitative evaluation of any

                              <span>Ocean modeling is a powerful tool for simulating the physical, chemical, and
biological processes of the ocean, which is the foundation for marine science
research and operational oceanography. Modern numerical ocean modeling mainly
consists of governing equations and numerical algorithms. Nonlinear
instability, computational expense, low reusability efficiency and high
coupling costs have gradually become the main bottlenecks for the further
development of numerical ocean modeling. Recently, artificial
intelligence-based modeling in scientific computing has shown revolutionary
potential for digital twins and scientific simulations, but the bottlenecks of
numerical ocean modeling have not been further solved. Here, we present
AI-GOMS, a large AI-driven global ocean modeling system, for accurate and
efficient global ocean daily prediction. AI-GOMS consists of a backbone model
with the Fourier-based Masked Autoencoder structure for basic ocean variable
prediction and lightweight fine-tuning models incorporating regional
downscaling, wave decoding, and biochemistry coupling modules. AI-GOMS has
achieved the best performance in 30 days of prediction for the global ocean
basic variables with 15 depth layers at 1/4{\deg} spatial resolution. Beyond
the good performance in statistical metrics, AI-GOMS realizes the simulation of
mesoscale eddies in the Kuroshio region at 1/12{\deg} spatial resolution and
ocean stratification in the tropical Pacific Ocean. AI-GOMS provides a new
backbone-downstream paradigm for Earth system modeling, which makes the system
transferable, scalable and reusable.</span>

and decision-makers would benefit from reliable, timely measures of the issues
impacting their communities during a disaster, and social media offers a
potentially rich data source. Social media can reflect public concerns and
demands during a disaster, offering valuable insights for decision-makers to
understand evolving situations and optimize resource allocation. We used
Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) topic modeling
to cluster topics from Twitter data. Then, we conducted a temporal-spatial
analysis to examine the distribution of these topics across different regions
during the 2020 western U.S. wildfire season. Our results show that Twitter
users mainly focused on three topics:&quot;health impact,&quot; &quot;damage,&quot; and
&quot;evacuation.&quot; We used the Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) theory to
explore the magnitude and velocity of topic diffusion on Twitter. The results
displayed a clear relationship between topic trends and wildfire propagation
patterns. The estimated parameters obtained from the SIR model in selected
cities revealed that residents exhibited a high level of several concerns
during the wildfire. Our study details how the SIR model and topic modeling

                              <span>In this paper, we describe a new algorithm called Preferential Attachment
k-class Classifier (PreAttacK) for detecting fake accounts in a social network.
Recently, several algorithms have obtained high accuracy on this problem.
However, they have done so by relying on information about fake accounts&#x27;
friendships or the content they share with others--the very things we seek to
prevent.

PreAttacK represents a significant departure from these approaches. We
provide some of the first detailed distributional analyses of how new fake (and
real) accounts first attempt to request friends after joining a major network
(Facebook). We show that even before a new account has made friends or shared
content, these initial friend request behaviors evoke a natural multi-class
extension of the canonical Preferential Attachment model of social network
growth.

We use this model to derive a new algorithm, PreAttacK. We prove that in
relevant problem instances, PreAttacK near-optimally approximates the posterior
probability that a new account is fake under this multi-class Preferential
Attachment model of new accounts&#x27; (not-yet-answered) friend requests. These are
the first provable guarantees for fake account detection that apply to new
users, and that do not require strong homophily assumptions.

This principled approach also makes PreAttacK the only algorithm with
provable guarantees that obtains state-of-the-art performance on new users on
the global Facebook network, where it converges to AUC&#x3D;0.9 after new users send
+ receive a total of just 20 not-yet-answered friend requests. For comparison,
state-of-the-art benchmarks do not obtain this AUC even after observing
additional data on new users&#x27; first 100 friend requests. Thus, unlike
mainstream algorithms, PreAttacK converges before the median new fake account
has made a single friendship (accepted friend request) with a human.</span>

where saliency is more well-studied, saliency is naturally localized through
the convolutional layers of the network; however, the same is not true in
modern transformer-stack networks used to process natural language. We adapt
gradient-based saliency methods for these networks, propose a method for
evaluating the degree of semantic coherence of each layer, and demonstrate
consistent improvement over numerous other methods for textual saliency on
multiple benchmark classification datasets. Our approach requires no additional

                              <span>Tracking and following objects of interest is critical to several robotics
use cases, ranging from industrial automation to logistics and warehousing, to
healthcare and security. In this paper, we present a robotic system to detect,
track, and follow any object in real-time. Our approach, dubbed &#x60;&#x60;follow
anything&#x27;&#x27; (FAn), is an open-vocabulary and multimodal model -- it is not
restricted to concepts seen at training time and can be applied to novel
classes at inference time using text, images, or click queries. Leveraging rich
visual descriptors from large-scale pre-trained models (foundation models), FAn
can detect and segment objects by matching multimodal queries (text, images,
clicks) against an input image sequence. These detected and segmented objects
are tracked across image frames, all while accounting for occlusion and object
re-emergence. We demonstrate FAn on a real-world robotic system (a micro aerial
vehicle) and report its ability to seamlessly follow the objects of interest in
a real-time control loop. FAn can be deployed on a laptop with a lightweight
(6-8 GB) graphics card, achieving a throughput of 6-20 frames per second. To
enable rapid adoption, deployment, and extensibility, we open-source all our
code on our project webpage at https://github.com/alaamaalouf/FollowAnything .

have shown that diffusion models offer several advantages over GANs, such as
generation of more realistic synthetic data and stable training in generating

the potential of diffusion models for generating realistic mixed-type tabular

low-rank MDPs, where both transition kernels and rewards may vary over time,
and the low-rank model contains unknown representation in addition to the
linear state embedding function. We first propose a parameter-dependent policy
optimization algorithm called PORTAL, and further improve PORTAL to its
parameter-free version of Ada-PORTAL, which is able to tune its
hyper-parameters adaptively without any prior knowledge of nonstationarity. For
both algorithms, we provide upper bounds on the average dynamic suboptimality
gap, which show that as long as the nonstationarity is not significantly large,
PORTAL and Ada-PORTAL are sample-efficient and can achieve arbitrarily small
average dynamic suboptimality gap with polynomial sample complexity.</span>

                              <span>Discovering causal relations among semantic factors is an emergent topic in
representation learning. Most causal representation learning (CRL) methods are
fully supervised, which is impractical due to costly labeling. To resolve this
restriction, weakly supervised CRL methods were introduced. To evaluate CRL
performance, four existing datasets, Pendulum, Flow, CelebA(BEARD) and
CelebA(SMILE), are utilized. However, existing CRL datasets are limited to
simple graphs with few generative factors. Thus we propose two new datasets
with a larger number of diverse generative factors and more sophisticated
causal graphs. In addition, current real datasets, CelebA(BEARD) and
CelebA(SMILE), the originally proposed causal graphs are not aligned with the
dataset distributions. Thus, we propose modifications to them.</span>

                              <span>Forecasting irregularly sampled time series with missing values is a crucial
task for numerous real-world applications such as healthcare, astronomy, and
climate sciences. State-of-the-art approaches to this problem rely on Ordinary
Differential Equations (ODEs) which are known to be slow and often require
additional features to handle missing values. To address this issue, we propose
a novel model using Graphs for Forecasting Irregularly Sampled Time Series with
missing values which we call GraFITi. GraFITi first converts the time series to
a Sparsity Structure Graph which is a sparse bipartite graph, and then
reformulates the forecasting problem as the edge weight prediction task in the
graph. It uses the power of Graph Neural Networks to learn the graph and
predict the target edge weights. GraFITi has been tested on 3 real-world and 1
synthetic irregularly sampled time series dataset with missing values and
compared with various state-of-the-art models. The experimental results
demonstrate that GraFITi improves the forecasting accuracy by up to 17% and
reduces the run time up to 5 times compared to the state-of-the-art forecasting
models.</span>

                              <span>Code summarization aims to generate concise natural language descriptions for
source code. The prevailing approaches adopt transformer-based encoder-decoder
architectures, where the Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) of the source code is
utilized for encoding structural information. However, ASTs are much longer
than the corresponding source code, and existing methods ignore this size
constraint by directly feeding the entire linearized AST into the encoders.
This simplistic approach makes it challenging to extract truly valuable
dependency relations from the overlong input sequence and leads to significant
computational overhead due to self-attention applied to all nodes in the AST.

To address this issue effectively and efficiently, we present a model,
AST-MHSA that uses multi-head attention to extract the important semantic
information from the AST. The model consists of two main components: an encoder
and a decoder. The encoder takes as input the abstract syntax tree (AST) of the
code and generates a sequence of hidden states. The decoder then takes these
hidden states as input and generates a natural language summary of the code.

The multi-head attention mechanism allows the model to learn different
representations of the input code, which can be combined to generate a more
comprehensive summary. The model is trained on a dataset of code and summaries,
and the parameters of the model are optimized to minimize the loss between the
generated summaries and the ground-truth summaries.</span>

                              <span>Time-dependent partial differential equations (PDEs) are ubiquitous in
science and engineering. Recently, mostly due to the high computational cost of
traditional solution techniques, deep neural network based surrogates have
gained increased interest. The practical utility of such neural PDE solvers
relies on their ability to provide accurate, stable predictions over long time
horizons, which is a notoriously hard problem. In this work, we present a
large-scale analysis of common temporal rollout strategies, identifying the
neglect of non-dominant spatial frequency information, often associated with
high frequencies in PDE solutions, as the primary pitfall limiting stable,
accurate rollout performance. Based on these insights, we draw inspiration from
recent advances in diffusion models to introduce PDE-Refiner; a novel model
class that enables more accurate modeling of all frequency components via a
multistep refinement process. We validate PDE-Refiner on challenging benchmarks
of complex fluid dynamics, demonstrating stable and accurate rollouts that
consistently outperform state-of-the-art models, including neural, numerical,
and hybrid neural-numerical architectures. We further demonstrate that
PDE-Refiner greatly enhances data efficiency, since the denoising objective
implicitly induces a novel form of spectral data augmentation. Finally,
PDE-Refiner&#x27;s connection to diffusion models enables an accurate and efficient
assessment of the model&#x27;s predictive uncertainty, allowing us to estimate when
the surrogate becomes inaccurate.</span>

                              <span>When applied to autonomous vehicle (AV) settings, action recognition can
enhance an environment model&#x27;s situational awareness. This is especially
prevalent in scenarios where traditional geometric descriptions and heuristics
in AVs are insufficient. However, action recognition has traditionally been
studied for humans, and its limited adaptability to noisy, un-clipped,
un-pampered, raw RGB data has limited its application in other fields. To push
for the advancement and adoption of action recognition into AVs, this work
proposes a novel two-stage action recognition system, termed RALACs. RALACs
formulates the problem of action recognition for road scenes, and bridges the
gap between it and the established field of human action recognition. This work
shows how attention layers can be useful for encoding the relations across
agents, and stresses how such a scheme can be class-agnostic. Furthermore, to
address the dynamic nature of agents on the road, RALACs constructs a novel
approach to adapting Region of Interest (ROI) Alignment to agent tracks for
downstream action classification. Finally, our scheme also considers the
problem of active agent detection, and utilizes a novel application of fusing
optical flow maps to discern relevant agents in a road scene. We show that our
proposed scheme can outperform the baseline on the ICCV2021 Road Challenge

                              <span>Learning disentangled representations with variational autoencoders (VAEs) is
often attributed to the regularisation component of the loss. In this work, we
highlight the interaction between data and the reconstruction term of the loss
as the main contributor to disentanglement in VAEs. We show that standard
benchmark datasets have unintended correlations between their subjective
ground-truth factors and perceived axes in the data according to typical VAE
reconstruction losses. Our work exploits this relationship to provide a theory
for what constitutes an adversarial dataset under a given reconstruction loss.
We verify this by constructing an example dataset that prevents disentanglement
in state-of-the-art frameworks while maintaining human-intuitive ground-truth
factors. Finally, we re-enable disentanglement by designing an example
reconstruction loss that is once again able to perceive the ground-truth
factors. Our findings demonstrate the subjective nature of disentanglement and
the importance of considering the interaction between the ground-truth factors,
data and notably, the reconstruction loss, which is under-recognised in the
literature.</span>

                              <span>Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are models that are utilized extensively
for the hierarchical extraction of features. Vision transformers (ViTs),
through the use of a self-attention mechanism, have recently achieved superior
modeling of global contextual information compared to CNNs. However, to realize
their image classification strength, ViTs require substantial training
datasets. Where the available training data are limited, current advanced
multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) can provide viable alternatives to both deep
CNNs and ViTs. In this paper, we developed the SGU-MLP, a learning algorithm
that effectively uses both MLPs and spatial gating units (SGUs) for precise
land use land cover (LULC) mapping. Results illustrated the superiority of the
developed SGU-MLP classification algorithm over several CNN and CNN-ViT-based
models, including HybridSN, ResNet, iFormer, EfficientFormer and CoAtNet. The
proposed SGU-MLP algorithm was tested through three experiments in Houston,
USA, Berlin, Germany and Augsburg, Germany. The SGU-MLP classification model
was found to consistently outperform the benchmark CNN and CNN-ViT-based
algorithms. For example, for the Houston experiment, SGU-MLP significantly
outperformed HybridSN, CoAtNet, Efficientformer, iFormer and ResNet by
approximately 15%, 19%, 20%, 21%, and 25%, respectively, in terms of average
accuracy. The code will be made publicly available at

                              <span>Epilepsy is a prevalent neurological disorder characterized by recurrent and
unpredictable seizures, necessitating accurate prediction for effective
management and patient care. Application of machine learning (ML) on
electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings, along with its ability to provide
valuable insights into brain activity during seizures, is able to make accurate
and robust seizure prediction an indispensable component in relevant studies.
In this research, we present a comprehensive comparative analysis of five
machine learning models - Random Forest (RF), Decision Tree (DT), Extra Trees
(ET), Logistic Regression (LR), and Gradient Boosting (GB) - for the prediction
of epileptic seizures using EEG data. The dataset underwent meticulous
preprocessing, including cleaning, normalization, outlier handling, and
oversampling, ensuring data quality and facilitating accurate model training.
These preprocessing techniques played a crucial role in enhancing the models&#x27;
performance. The results of our analysis demonstrate the performance of each
model in terms of accuracy. The LR classifier achieved an accuracy of 56.95%,
while GB and DT both attained 97.17% accuracy. RT achieved a higher accuracy of
98.99%, while the ET model exhibited the best performance with an accuracy of
99.29%. Our findings reveal that the ET model outperformed not only the other
models in the comparative analysis but also surpassed the state-of-the-art
results from previous research. The superior performance of the ET model makes
it a compelling choice for accurate and robust epileptic seizure prediction
using EEG data.</span>

                              <span>We replace the multiplication and sigmoid function of the conventional
recurrent gate with addition and ReLU activation. This mechanism is designed to
maintain long-term memory for sequence processing but at a reduced
computational cost, thereby opening up for more efficient execution or larger
models on restricted hardware. Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) with gating
mechanisms such as LSTM and GRU have been widely successful in learning from
sequential data due to their ability to capture long-term dependencies.
Conventionally, the update based on current inputs and the previous state
history is each multiplied with dynamic weights and combined to compute the
next state. However, multiplication can be computationally expensive,
especially for certain hardware architectures or alternative arithmetic systems
such as homomorphic encryption. It is demonstrated that the novel gating
mechanism can capture long-term dependencies for a standard synthetic sequence
learning task while significantly reducing computational costs such that
execution time is reduced by half on CPU and by one-third under encryption.
Experimental results on handwritten text recognition tasks furthermore show
that the proposed architecture can be trained to achieve comparable accuracy to
conventional GRU and LSTM baselines. The gating mechanism introduced in this
paper may enable privacy-preserving AI applications operating under homomorphic
encryption by avoiding the multiplication of encrypted variables. It can also
support quantization in (unencrypted) plaintext applications, with the
potential for substantial performance gains since the addition-based
formulation can avoid the expansion to double precision often required for
multiplication.</span>

                              <span>The primary method for identifying mental disorders automatically has
traditionally involved using binary classifiers. These classifiers are trained
using behavioral data obtained from an interview setup. In this training
process, data from individuals with the specific disorder under consideration
are categorized as the positive class, while data from all other participants
constitute the negative class. In practice, it is widely recognized that
certain mental disorders share similar symptoms, causing the collected
behavioral data to encompass a variety of attributes associated with multiple
disorders. Consequently, attributes linked to the targeted mental disorder
might also be present within the negative class. This data impurity may lead to
sub-optimal training of the classifier for a mental disorder of interest. In
this study, we investigate this hypothesis in the context of major depressive
disorder (MDD) and post-traumatic stress disorder detection (PTSD). The results
show that upon removal of such data impurity, MDD and PTSD detection
performances are significantly improved.</span>

                              <span>A significant number of machine learning models are vulnerable to model
extraction attacks, which focus on stealing the models by using specially
curated queries against the target model. This task is well accomplished by
using part of the training data or a surrogate dataset to train a new model
that mimics a target model in a white-box environment. In pragmatic situations,
however, the target models are trained on private datasets that are
inaccessible to the adversary. The data-free model extraction technique
replaces this problem when it comes to using queries artificially curated by a
generator similar to that used in Generative Adversarial Nets. We propose for
the first time, to the best of our knowledge, an adversary black box attack
extending to a regression problem for predicting bounding box coordinates in
object detection. As part of our study, we found that defining a loss function
and using a novel generator setup is one of the key aspects in extracting the
target model. We find that the proposed model extraction method achieves
significant results by using reasonable queries. The discovery of this object

                              <span>Stroke is a significant cause of mortality and morbidity, necessitating early
predictive strategies to minimize risks. Traditional methods for evaluating
patients, such as Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE II,
IV) and Simplified Acute Physiology Score III (SAPS III), have limited accuracy
and interpretability. This paper proposes a novel approach: an interpretable,
attention-based transformer model for early stroke mortality prediction. This
model seeks to address the limitations of previous predictive models, providing
both interpretability (providing clear, understandable explanations of the
model) and fidelity (giving a truthful explanation of the model&#x27;s dynamics from
input to output). Furthermore, the study explores and compares fidelity and
interpretability scores using Shapley values and attention-based scores to

classifiers such as gradient-boosting decision trees (GBDTs) against
adversarial perturbation attacks. The idea is based on a recent symmetry
defense for convolutional neural network classifiers (CNNs) that utilizes CNNs&#x27;
lack of invariance with respect to symmetries. CNNs lack invariance because
they can classify a symmetric sample, such as a horizontally flipped image,
differently from the original sample. CNNs&#x27; lack of invariance also means that
CNNs can classify symmetric adversarial samples differently from the incorrect
classification of adversarial samples. Using CNNs&#x27; lack of invariance, the
recent CNN symmetry defense has shown that the classification of symmetric
adversarial samples reverts to the correct sample classification. In order to
apply the same symmetry defense to GBDTs, we examine GBDT invariance and are
the first to show that GBDTs also lack invariance with respect to symmetries.
We apply and evaluate the GBDT symmetry defense for nine datasets against six
perturbation attacks with a threat model that ranges from zero-knowledge to
perfect-knowledge adversaries. Using the feature inversion symmetry against
zero-knowledge adversaries, we achieve up to 100% accuracy on adversarial
samples even when default and robust classifiers have 0% accuracy. Using the
feature inversion and horizontal flip symmetries against perfect-knowledge
adversaries, we achieve up to over 95% accuracy on adversarial samples for the
GBDT classifier of the F-MNIST dataset even when default and robust classifiers
have 0% accuracy.</span>

                              <span>We address the challenge of sound propagation simulations in $3$D virtual
rooms with moving sources, which have applications in virtual/augmented
reality, game audio, and spatial computing. Solutions to the wave equation can
describe wave phenomena such as diffraction and interference. However,
simulating them using conventional numerical discretization methods with
hundreds of source and receiver positions is intractable, making stimulating a
sound field with moving sources impractical. To overcome this limitation, we
propose using deep operator networks to approximate linear wave-equation
operators. This enables the rapid prediction of sound propagation in realistic
3D acoustic scenes with moving sources, achieving millisecond-scale
computations. By learning a compact surrogate model, we avoid the offline
calculation and storage of impulse responses for all relevant source/listener
pairs. Our experiments, including various complex scene geometries, show good
agreement with reference solutions, with root mean squared errors ranging from
0.02 Pa to 0.10 Pa. Notably, our method signifies a paradigm shift as no prior
machine learning approach has achieved precise predictions of complete wave
fields within realistic domains. We anticipate that our findings will drive
further exploration of deep neural operator methods, advancing research in
immersive user experiences within virtual environments.</span>

                              <span>This paper demonstrates the utility of organized numerical representations of
genes in research involving flat string gene formats (i.e., FASTA/FASTQ5).
FASTA/FASTQ files have several current limitations, such as their large file
sizes, slow processing speeds for mapping and alignment, and contextual
dependencies. These challenges significantly hinder investigations and tasks
that involve finding similar sequences. The solution lies in transforming
sequences into an alternative representation that facilitates easier clustering
into similar groups compared to the raw sequences themselves. By assigning a
unique vector embedding to each short sequence, it is possible to more
efficiently cluster and improve upon compression performance for the string
representations of cDNA libraries. Furthermore, through learning alternative
coordinate vector embeddings based on the contexts of codon triplets, we can
demonstrate clustering based on amino acid properties. Finally, using this
sequence embedding method to encode barcodes and cDNA sequences, we can improve
the time complexity of the similarity search by coupling vector embeddings with
an algorithm that determines the proximity of vectors in Euclidean space; this
allows us to perform sequence similarity searches in a quicker and more modular
fashion.</span>

                              <span>The multifactorial etiology of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) suggests that
its study would benefit greatly from multimodal approaches that combine data
from widely varying platforms, e.g., neuroimaging, genetics, and clinical
characterization. Prior neuroimaging-genetic analyses often apply naive feature
concatenation approaches in data-driven work or use the findings from one
modality to guide posthoc analysis of another, missing the opportunity to
analyze the paired multimodal data in a truly unified approach. In this paper,
we develop a more integrative model for combining genetic, demographic, and
neuroimaging data. Inspired by the influence of genotype on phenotype, we
propose using an attention-based approach where the genetic data guides
attention to neuroimaging features of importance for model prediction. The
genetic data is derived from copy number variation parameters, while the
neuroimaging data is from functional magnetic resonance imaging. We evaluate
the proposed approach on ASD classification and severity prediction tasks,
using a sex-balanced dataset of 228 ASD and typically developing subjects in a
10-fold cross-validation framework. We demonstrate that our attention-based
model combining genetic information, demographic data, and functional magnetic
resonance imaging results in superior prediction performance compared to other
multimodal approaches.</span>

                              <span>The present work discusses the use of a weakly-supervised deep learning
algorithm that reduces the cost of labelling pixel-level masks for complex
radio galaxies with multiple components. The algorithm is trained on weak
class-level labels of radio galaxies to get class activation maps (CAMs). The
CAMs are further refined using an inter-pixel relations network (IRNet) to get
instance segmentation masks over radio galaxies and the positions of their
infrared hosts. We use data from the Australian Square Kilometre Array
Pathfinder (ASKAP) telescope, specifically the Evolutionary Map of the Universe
(EMU) Pilot Survey, which covered a sky area of 270 square degrees with an RMS
sensitivity of 25-35 $\mu$Jy/beam. We demonstrate that weakly-supervised deep
learning algorithms can achieve high accuracy in predicting pixel-level
information, including masks for the extended radio emission encapsulating all
galaxy components and the positions of the infrared host galaxies. We evaluate
the performance of our method using mean Average Precision (mAP) across
multiple classes at a standard intersection over union (IoU) threshold of 0.5.
We show that the model achieves a mAP$_{50}$ of 67.5\% and 76.8\% for radio
masks and infrared host positions, respectively. The network architecture can

                              <span>Phosphorylation is central to numerous fundamental cellular processes,
influencing the onset and progression of a variety of diseases. Identification
of phosphorylation sites is thus an important step for understanding the
molecular mechanisms of cells and virus infection, which potentially leads to
new therapeutic targets. In this study, we present PTransIPs, a novel deep
learning model for the identification of phosphorylation sites. PTransIPs
treats amino acids in protein sequences as words in natural language,
extracting unique encodings based on the types along with position of amino
acids in the sequence. It also incorporates embeddings from large pre-trained
protein models as additional data inputs. PTransIPS is further trained on a
combination model of convolutional neural network with residual connections and
Transformer model equipped with multi-head attention mechanisms. At last, the
model outputs classification results through a fully connected layer. The
results of independent testing reveal that PTransIPs outperforms existing
state-of-the-art methodologies, achieving AUROCs of 0.9232 and 0.9660 for
identifying phosphorylated S/T and Y sites respectively. In addition, ablation
studies prove that pretrained model embeddings contribute to the performance of
PTransIPs. Furthermore, PTransIPs has interpretable amino acid preference,

                              <span>While many studies have assessed the fairness of AI algorithms in the medical
field, the causes of differences in prediction performance are often unknown.
This lack of knowledge about the causes of bias hampers the efficacy of bias
mitigation, as evidenced by the fact that simple dataset balancing still often
performs best in reducing performance gaps but is unable to resolve all
performance differences. In this work, we investigate the causes of gender bias
in machine learning-based chest X-ray diagnosis. In particular, we explore the
hypothesis that breast tissue leads to underexposure of the lungs and causes
lower model performance. Methodologically, we propose a new sampling method
which addresses the highly skewed distribution of recordings per patient in two
widely used public datasets, while at the same time reducing the impact of
label errors. Our comprehensive analysis of gender differences across diseases,
datasets, and gender representations in the training set shows that dataset
imbalance is not the sole cause of performance differences. Moreover, relative
group performance differs strongly between datasets, indicating important
dataset-specific factors influencing male/female group performance. Finally, we
investigate the effect of breast tissue more specifically, by cropping out the
breasts from recordings, finding that this does not resolve the observed
performance gaps. In conclusion, our results indicate that dataset-specific
factors, not fundamental physiological differences, are the main drivers of
male--female performance gaps in chest X-ray analyses on widely used NIH and
CheXpert Dataset.</span>

                              <span>In recent years, the field of data-driven neural network-based machine
learning (ML) algorithms has grown significantly and spurred research in its
applicability to instrumentation and control systems. While they are promising
in operational contexts, the trustworthiness of such algorithms is not
adequately assessed. Failures of ML-integrated systems are poorly understood;
the lack of comprehensive risk modeling can degrade the trustworthiness of
these systems. In recent reports by the National Institute for Standards and
Technology, trustworthiness in ML is a critical barrier to adoption and will
play a vital role in intelligent systems&#x27; safe and accountable operation. Thus,
in this work, we demonstrate a real-time model-agnostic method to evaluate the
relative reliability of ML predictions by incorporating out-of-distribution
detection on the training dataset. It is well documented that ML algorithms
excel at interpolation (or near-interpolation) tasks but significantly degrade
at extrapolation. This occurs when new samples are &quot;far&quot; from training samples.
The method, referred to as the Laplacian distributed decay for reliability
(LADDR), determines the difference between the operational and training
datasets, which is used to calculate a prediction&#x27;s relative reliability. LADDR
is demonstrated on a feedforward neural network-based model used to predict
safety significant factors during different loss-of-flow transients. LADDR is
intended as a &quot;data supervisor&quot; and determines the appropriateness of
well-trained ML models in the context of operational conditions. Ultimately,
LADDR illustrates how training data can be used as evidence to support the
trustworthiness of ML predictions when utilized for conventional interpolation
tasks.</span>

                              <span>Causal inference is a crucial goal of science, enabling researchers to arrive
at meaningful conclusions regarding the predictions of hypothetical
interventions using observational data. Path models, Structural Equation Models
(SEMs), and, more generally, Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs), provide a means to
unambiguously specify assumptions regarding the causal structure underlying a
phenomenon. Unlike DAGs, which make very few assumptions about the functional
and parametric form, SEM assumes linearity. This can result in functional
misspecification which prevents researchers from undertaking reliable effect
size estimation. In contrast, we propose Super Learner Equation Modeling, a
path modeling technique integrating machine learning Super Learner ensembles.
We empirically demonstrate its ability to provide consistent and unbiased
estimates of causal effects, its competitive performance for linear models when
compared with SEM, and highlight its superiority over SEM when dealing with
non-linear relationships. We provide open-source code, and a tutorial notebook
with example usage, accentuating the easy-to-use nature of the method.</span>

                              <span>In today&#x27;s rapidly evolving urban landscapes, efficient and accurate mapping
of road infrastructure is critical for optimizing transportation systems,
enhancing road safety, and improving the overall mobility experience for
drivers and commuters. Yet, a formidable bottleneck obstructs progress - the
laborious and time-intensive manual identification of intersections. Simply
considering the shear number of intersections that need to be identified, and
the labor hours required per intersection, the need for an automated solution
becomes undeniable. To address this challenge, we propose a novel approach that
leverages connected vehicle data and cutting-edge deep learning techniques. By
employing geohashing to segment vehicle trajectories and then generating image
representations of road segments, we utilize the YOLOv5 (You Only Look Once
version 5) algorithm for accurate classification of both straight road segments
and intersections. Experimental results demonstrate an impressive overall
classification accuracy of 95%, with straight roads achieving a remarkable 97%
F1 score and intersections reaching a 90% F1 score. This approach not only
saves time and resources but also enables more frequent updates and a
comprehensive understanding of the road network. Our research showcases the
potential impact on traffic management, urban planning, and autonomous vehicle
navigation systems. The fusion of connected vehicle data and deep learning
models holds promise for a transformative shift in road infrastructure mapping,
propelling us towards a smarter, safer, and more connected transportation
ecosystem.</span>

                              <span>Riemannian submanifold optimization with momentum is computationally
challenging because, to ensure that the iterates remain on the submanifold, we
often need to solve difficult differential equations. Here, we simplify such
difficulties for a class of sparse or structured symmetric positive-definite
matrices with the affine-invariant metric. We do so by proposing a generalized
version of the Riemannian normal coordinates that dynamically orthonormalizes
the metric and locally converts the problem into an unconstrained problem in
the Euclidean space. We use our approach to simplify existing approaches for
structured covariances and develop matrix-inverse-free $2^\text{nd}$-order
optimizers for deep learning with low precision by using only matrix
multiplications. Code: https://github.com/yorkerlin/StructuredNGD-DL</span>

                              <span>Channel modelling is essential to designing modern wireless communication
systems. The increasing complexity of channel modelling and the cost of
collecting high-quality wireless channel data have become major challenges. In
this paper, we propose a diffusion model based channel sampling approach for
rapidly synthesizing channel realizations from limited data. We use a diffusion
model with a U Net based architecture operating in the frequency space domain.
To evaluate how well the proposed model reproduces the true distribution of
channels in the training dataset, two evaluation metrics are used: $i)$ the
approximate $2$-Wasserstein distance between real and generated distributions
of the normalized power spectrum in the antenna and frequency domains and $ii)$
precision and recall metric for distributions. We show that, compared to
existing GAN based approaches which suffer from mode collapse and unstable
training, our diffusion based approach trains stably and generates diverse and
high-fidelity samples from the true channel distribution. We also show that we
can pretrain the model on a simulated urban macro-cellular channel dataset and
fine-tune it on a smaller, out-of-distribution urban micro-cellular dataset,
therefore showing that it is feasible to model real world channels using
limited data with this approach.</span>

                              <span>Counter-adversarial system design problems have lately motivated the
development of inverse Bayesian filters. For example, inverse Kalman filter
(I-KF) has been recently formulated to estimate the adversary&#x27;s
Kalman-filter-tracked estimates and hence, predict the adversary&#x27;s future
steps. The purpose of this paper and the companion paper (Part I) is to address
the inverse filtering problem in non-linear systems by proposing an inverse
extended Kalman filter (I-EKF). The companion paper proposed the theory of
I-EKF (with and without unknown inputs) and I-KF (with unknown inputs). In this
paper, we develop this theory for highly non-linear models, which employ
second-order, Gaussian sum, and dithered forward EKFs. In particular, we derive
theoretical stability guarantees for the inverse second-order EKF using the
bounded non-linearity approach. To address the limitation of the standard
I-EKFs that the system model and forward filter are perfectly known to the
defender, we propose reproducing kernel Hilbert space-based EKF to learn the
unknown system dynamics based on its observations, which can be employed as an
inverse filter to infer the adversary&#x27;s estimate. Numerical experiments
demonstrate the state estimation performance of the proposed filters using
recursive Cram\&#x27;{e}r-Rao lower bound as a benchmark.</span>

                              <span>Here, we show that the InfoNCE objective is equivalent to the ELBO in a new
class of probabilistic generative model, the recognition parameterised model
(RPM). When we learn the optimal prior, the RPM ELBO becomes equal to the
mutual information (MI; up to a constant), establishing a connection to
pre-existing self-supervised learning methods such as InfoNCE. However,
practical InfoNCE methods do not use the MI as an objective; the MI is
invariant to arbitrary invertible transformations, so using an MI objective can
lead to highly entangled representations (Tschannen et al., 2019). Instead, the
actual InfoNCE objective is a simplified lower bound on the MI which is loose
even in the infinite sample limit. Thus, an objective that works (i.e. the
actual InfoNCE objective) appears to be motivated as a loose bound on an
objective that does not work (i.e. the true MI which gives arbitrarily
entangled representations). We give an alternative motivation for the actual
InfoNCE objective. In particular, we show that in the infinite sample limit,
and for a particular choice of prior, the actual InfoNCE objective is equal to
the ELBO (up to a constant); and the ELBO is equal to the marginal likelihood
with a deterministic recognition model. Thus, we argue that our VAE perspective
gives a better motivation for InfoNCE than MI, as the actual InfoNCE objective
is only loosely bounded by the MI, but is equal to the ELBO/marginal likelihood
(up to a constant).</span>

                              <span>Selective inference methods are developed for group lasso estimators for use
with a wide class of distributions and loss functions. The method includes the
use of exponential family distributions, as well as quasi-likelihood modeling
for overdispersed count data, for example, and allows for categorical or
grouped covariates as well as continuous covariates. A randomized
group-regularized optimization problem is studied. The added randomization
allows us to construct a post-selection likelihood which we show to be adequate
for selective inference when conditioning on the event of the selection of the
grouped covariates. This likelihood also provides a selective point estimator,
accounting for the selection by the group lasso. Confidence regions for the
regression parameters in the selected model take the form of Wald-type regions
and are shown to have bounded volume. The selective inference method for
grouped lasso is illustrated on data from the national health and nutrition
examination survey while simulations showcase its behaviour and favorable
comparison with other methods.</span>

                              <span>As data shift or new data become available, updating clinical machine
learning models may be necessary to maintain or improve performance over time.
However, updating a model can introduce compatibility issues when the behavior
of the updated model does not align with user expectations, resulting in poor
user-model team performance. Existing compatibility measures depend on model
decision thresholds, limiting their applicability in settings where models are
used to generate rankings based on estimated risk. To address this limitation,
we propose a novel rank-based compatibility measure, $C^R$, and a new loss
function that aims to optimize discriminative performance while encouraging
good compatibility. Applied to a case study in mortality risk stratification
leveraging data from MIMIC, our approach yields more compatible models while
maintaining discriminative performance compared to existing model selection
techniques, with an increase in $C^R$ of $0.019$ ($95\%$ confidence interval:
$0.005$, $0.035$). This work provides new tools to analyze and update risk

                              <span>Random Search is one of the most widely-used method for Hyperparameter
Optimization, and is critical to the success of deep learning models. Despite
its astonishing performance, little non-heuristic theory has been developed to
describe the underlying working mechanism. This paper gives a theoretical
accounting of Random Search. We introduce the concept of \emph{scattering
dimension} that describes the landscape of the underlying function, and
quantifies the performance of random search. We show that, when the environment
is noise-free, the output of random search converges to the optimal value in
probability at rate $ \widetilde{\mathcal{O}} \left( \left( \frac{1}{T}
\right)^{ \frac{1}{d_s} } \right) $, where $ d_s \ge 0 $ is the scattering
dimension of the underlying function. When the observed function values are
corrupted by bounded $iid$ noise, the output of random search converges to the
optimal value in probability at rate $ \widetilde{\mathcal{O}} \left( \left(
\frac{1}{T} \right)^{ \frac{1}{d_s + 1} } \right) $. In addition, based on the
principles of random search, we introduce an algorithm, called BLiN-MOS, for
Lipschitz bandits in doubling metric spaces that are also endowed with a
probability measure, and show that BLiN-MOS achieves a regret rate of order $
\widetilde{\mathcal{O}} \left( T^{ \frac{d_z}{d_z + 1} } \right) $, where $d_z$
is the zooming dimension of the problem instance.</span>

                              <span>Multi-task learning is frequently used to model a set of related response
variables from the same set of features, improving predictive performance and
modeling accuracy relative to methods that handle each response variable
separately. Despite the potential of multi-task learning to yield more powerful
inference than single-task alternatives, prior work in this area has largely
omitted uncertainty quantification. Our focus in this paper is a common
multi-task problem in neuroimaging, where the goal is to understand the
relationship between multiple cognitive task scores (or other subject-level
assessments) and brain connectome data collected from imaging. We propose a
framework for selective inference to address this problem, with the flexibility
to: (i) jointly identify the relevant covariates for each task through a
sparsity-inducing penalty, and (ii) conduct valid inference in a model based on
the estimated sparsity structure. Our framework offers a new conditional
procedure for inference, based on a refinement of the selection event that
yields a tractable selection-adjusted likelihood. This gives an approximate
system of estimating equations for maximum likelihood inference, solvable via a
single convex optimization problem, and enables us to efficiently form
confidence intervals with approximately the correct coverage. Applied to both
simulated data and data from the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD)
study, our selective inference methods yield tighter confidence intervals than
commonly used alternatives, such as data splitting. We also demonstrate through
simulations that multi-task learning with selective inference can more
accurately recover true signals than single-task methods.</span>

                              <span>One of the established approaches to causal discovery consists of combining
directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) with structural causal models (SCMs) to describe
the functional dependencies of effects on their causes. Possible
identifiability of SCMs given data depends on assumptions made on the noise
variables and the functional classes in the SCM. For instance, in the LiNGAM
model, the functional class is restricted to linear functions and the
disturbances have to be non-Gaussian.

In this work, we propose TSLiNGAM, a new method for identifying the DAG of a
causal model based on observational data. TSLiNGAM builds on DirectLiNGAM, a
popular algorithm which uses simple OLS regression for identifying causal
directions between variables. TSLiNGAM leverages the non-Gaussianity assumption
of the error terms in the LiNGAM model to obtain more efficient and robust
estimation of the causal structure. TSLiNGAM is justified theoretically and is
studied empirically in an extensive simulation study. It performs significantly
better on heavy-tailed and skewed data and demonstrates a high small-sample
efficiency. In addition, TSLiNGAM also shows better robustness properties as it
is more resilient to contamination.</span>

                              <span>In the past few years, there has been considerable interest in two prominent
approaches for Distributionally Robust Optimization (DRO): Divergence-based and
Wasserstein-based methods. The divergence approach models misspecification in
terms of likelihood ratios, while the latter models it through a measure of
distance or cost in actual outcomes. Building upon these advances, this paper
introduces a novel approach that unifies these methods into a single framework
based on optimal transport (OT) with conditional moment constraints. Our
proposed approach, for example, makes it possible for optimal adversarial
distributions to simultaneously perturb likelihood and outcomes, while
producing an optimal (in an optimal transport sense) coupling between the
baseline model and the adversarial model.Additionally, the paper investigates
several duality results and presents tractable reformulations that enhance the

                              <span>Modern transportation planning relies heavily on accurate predictions of
person and vehicle trips. However, traditional planning models often fail to
account for the intricacies and dynamics of travel behavior, leading to
less-than-optimal accuracy in these predictions. This study explores the
potential of deep learning techniques to transform the way we approach trip
predictions, and ultimately, transportation planning. Utilizing a comprehensive
dataset from the National Household Travel Survey (NHTS), we developed and
trained a deep learning model for predicting person and vehicle trips. The
proposed model leverages the vast amount of information in the NHTS data,
capturing complex, non-linear relationships that were previously overlooked by
traditional models. As a result, our deep learning model achieved an impressive
accuracy of 98% for person trip prediction and 96% for vehicle trip estimation.
This represents a significant improvement over the performances of traditional
transportation planning models, thereby demonstrating the power of deep
learning in this domain. The implications of this study extend beyond just more
accurate predictions. By enhancing the accuracy and reliability of trip
prediction models, planners can formulate more effective, data-driven
transportation policies, infrastructure, and services. As such, our research
underscores the need for the transportation planning field to embrace advanced
techniques like deep learning. The detailed methodology, along with a thorough
discussion of the results and their implications, are presented in the
subsequent sections of this paper.</span>

 I&#x27;d be very interested to talk to anyone that is utilizing a distributed model for daily use or for an application and even more interested to talk to anyone running a model among friends or colleagues in the private mode.

                              <span>RL techniques in general have the ability to increase the time horizon of models since future rewards impact the Q value or advantage of the current action.
 My understanding of RLHF is a reward model is trained based on human feedback, and then the LLM is optimized to maximize the reward from the reward model. Is this correct?
 If so, does the reward model care about future rewards? Does this impact the time horizon?

                              <span>I am new to this field and feeling quite confused. I need to use a DL-based Keras Embeddings technique with the Dense layer for text classification (specifically, a Binary Classification problem), along with TF-IDF featurization as input for the Random Forest Algorithm. However, my confusion arises from the fact that the Keras Embedding Layer also serves as a featurization technique. Therefore, I&#x27;m uncertain whether this layer should be used as input for the Random Forest or it has the capability to classify text on its own. Second question is that what can be the reason to use Dense Layer and What it is exactly here.

 Trying to make a plan so I can chip away at stuff day-by-day over the next few months/year(s).
 I was wondering if I&#x27;ve classified everything in this diagram in the correct way or if I&#x27;m missing anything ?
 Reason I ask here is I&#x27;m not too sure if I&#x27;m missing anything obsecure or if I&#x27;ve misinterpreted anything ?
 Thank you !

                              <span>I&#x27;m currently working through &quot;Understanding Deep Learning&quot; by Simon J.D. Prince. On page 403, he makes the following statement about regularization:
  
Another possible explanation for the ease with which models are trained is that regularization makes the loss surface flatter and more convex.
  
From my understanding, L2 regularization (or weight decay) indeed adds a convex term λ∣∣w∣∣2 to the loss function, smoothing it out. Additionally, the Hessian matrix becomes more positive with the addition of the regularization term 2λI, giving the function a more convex characteristic.
 However, I&#x27;m puzzled as to how other regularization methods like Dropout, L1/Lasso, or Early Stopping might lead to a similarly flatter and more convex loss surface. Can anyone offer insights or explanations on this?

 Petar Veličković says that in their AC batch 65% submitted no rebuttal or withdrew.

 Xin Eric Wang says in their batch pre-rebuttal no papers had an avg score above an weak accept.

 Will NeurIPS keep 25% acceptance rate? What do you think will happen to neurips in light of the above? Is this the end of big ML confs?

                              <span>Hi!
 I have been trying to find a good guide of how best to implement a Sentence Transformers style model using Keras, but have not found anything :(
 I have managed to get something running, but I am not sure it is pretty and wanted to see if anyone know how to improve it or maybe has seen a nice implementation on the web?
 Here is my first draft https://gist.github.com/ydennisy/fec55fab84d107b72852ba2d2c2b61db

                              <span>I can understand part of the statement if you are using Adam. Since the trainable params are much less, we are saving on optimizer states. However, even we are not actually updating the pretrained model, we still need to compute the graidients for backpropagation to the lower layer of the lora head. The memory usage of gradients would not decrease. Please correct me if I am wrong.

                              <span>Hi everyone! I&#x27;m working on a model using YOLO v8x to detect regions on identity cards, but it struggles with identifying address regions. This issue seems to stem from insufficient data. Would it be advisable to incorporate additional data containing addresses(other documents instead of identity card) to enhance the model&#x27;s accuracy in detecting address regions?

Check us out at www.twilix.io if anything below resonates with you and I hope you find some of it helpful.
 So to begin, in my previous company we invested a few months building a chatbot to help with user onboarding. At first everything was great, and we saw a 40% decrease in drop-off rates (which is significant given we were building a consumer facing app), but somehow over time this drop-off rate started creeping up again. Perplexed by the unexpected turn in metrics, management started to question the benefits of maintaining this chatbot and was skeptical that we were cherry picking examples to showcase its performance…</span>

However, I&#x27;m a bit confused from the documentation of the original repositories (both from CompVis). My intention is to experiment with significantly smaller models and datasets while retaining the same architecture. Unfortunately, neither repository offers an official configuration for training the txt2img architecture.Through my exploration of the issues, I&#x27;ve observed that the training script provided by the latent diffusion repository does support txt2img (although an official configuration has not been made available yet). I&#x27;m curious if any of you might be familiar with better online resources or tutorials that can provide a clearer and more comprehensive understanding of the training process.

 Abstract:
  
Recent advancements in Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated significant progress in tackling complex multimodal tasks. Among these cutting-edge developments, Google&#x27;s Bard stands out for its remarkable multimodal capabilities, promoting comprehensive comprehension and reasoning across various domains. This work presents an early and holistic evaluation of LVLMs&#x27; multimodal abilities, with a particular focus on Bard, by proposing a lightweight variant of LVLM-eHub, named Tiny LVLM-eHub. In comparison to the vanilla version, Tiny LVLM-eHub possesses several appealing properties. Firstly, it provides a systematic assessment of six categories of multimodal capabilities, including visual perception, visual knowledge acquisition, visual reasoning, visual commonsense, object hallucination, and embodied intelligence, through quantitative evaluation of 42 standard text-related visual benchmarks. Secondly, it conducts an in-depth analysis of LVLMs&#x27; predictions using the ChatGPT Ensemble Evaluation (CEE), which leads to a robust and accurate evaluation and exhibits improved alignment with human evaluation compared to the word matching approach. Thirdly, it comprises a mere 2.1K image-text pairs, facilitating ease of use for practitioners to evaluate their own offline LVLMs. Through extensive experimental analysis, this study demonstrates that Bard outperforms previous LVLMs in most multimodal capabilities except object hallucination, to which Bard is still susceptible. Tiny LVLM-eHub serves as a baseline evaluation for various LVLMs and encourages innovative strategies aimed at advancing multimodal techniques.

                              <span>Hi,
 I have written a post discussion whether or not the hidden size in transformers is an overkill. 
 TLDR;
 I show that an embedding size of 2048 is too much to represent just one token like &#x60;is&#x60; but rather, it can encode an average 8 tokens with up-to 16 tokens almost losslessly. 
 I think if we can design more compute efficient transformers with some of the ideas that I explore in the post.
 Of course this is not a proper research with ablation studies and empirical analysis. But I would love to hear your thoughts on this topic.

                              <span>Personal Shelf Inspector is an application that helps visually impaired people during their day-to-day shopping. The application is based on a simple neural network and was created as a part of the AI for Accesibility Hackathon in 2020 in Prague.
 We decided to build free tools that make shopping for visually impaired people more accessible. These tools can be implemented in any retail chain within the loyalty app or in-store.

 The Idea
 A visually impaired person only needs their smartphone to use our tools. Personal Shelf Inspector is a web application that reads the price and product name from a price tag. The algorithm selects the price tag closest to the centre of the photo and sends it to the model, which reads the price and product name on the price tag. Then it returns this information to the application, which appears as text on the screen.

 The voice-over built into the user&#x27;s mobile phone reads this text aloud. The app also helps to read the banknote values and read from a live video.
 What could be other cool ideas and concepts to help making the world more accesible using AI and Machine Learning?

                              <span>In &quot;InstructBLIP&quot; paper, authors say: &quot;We transform 26 datasets into the instruction tuning format&quot; in order to create a general-purpose vision language model via instruction tuning. However, they did not provide details on how they did this transformation. At a first glance, three ways come to mind:
  
They use ChatGPT/GPT-4 to automatically transform them.
 They define and code rules to automatically transform them.
 They manually transform them (highly improbable)
  
Someone knows the answer? Thank you so much

                              <span>At my company, we collaborate closely with top-level executives from Fortune 500 companies and other industry leaders, helping them identify and secure the right partners for crucial digital transformation initiatives. When these executives present us with their project specifics, budgets, obstacles, and schedules, we take charge of finding the right partners for their RFP process, enhancing the entire workflow for efficiency and effectiveness. Currently, I have a collection of RFP projects and I’m keen on leveraging AI to simplify the task of identifying potential partners to call. I provided ChatGPT with all of my various project details and would inquire, ‘Which of my client projects align well with X company, and what are the reasons?’ OR “Would X company align with any of my projects?” The AI started off well, but eventually became confused and started making mistakes. Are there any systems available that could assist me in this project matching process?

I&#x27;ve been playing around with Google Vertex AI (https://console.cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative/) but the current results are ... meh! 🤷‍♂️ 
 Any other recommendations?

The algorithm, HelioLinc3D, was explicitly designed for the Vera Rubin Observatory currently under construction in Northern Chile.[1]
 The U.S. Defense Department has created a task force to evaluate and guide the application of generative artificial intelligence for national security purposes, amid an explosion of public interest in the technology.[2]
 China’s largest web and cloud providers (Alibaba, Baidu, ByteDance, and Tencent)are lining up to buy as many Nvidia GPUs as they can while they still can get their hands on them.[3]
 At Black Hat USA 2023, DARPA issued a call to top computer scientists, AI experts, software developers, and beyond to participate in the AI Cyber Challenge (AIxCC) – a two-year competition aimed at driving innovation at the nexus of AI and cybersecurity to create a new generation of cybersecurity tools.[4]

                              <span>Hi everyone, we finally ended our journey through Dreamer, and we released the last version, Dreamer V3 in SheepRL.
 Our implementation follows closely the author&#x27;s one, and is very well documented, with a blog post to explain the details and differences between this version and Dreamer V2.
 Together with Dreamer, we also have Plan2Explore with Dreamer v1 and v2.
 Finally, we completed the integration with Diambra, so you can try your agents on new (funnier) benchmarks.
 Check it out and feel free to contribute. Every feedback is appreciated :)

I kind of understand the metadata CSV file but the other 4 don&#x27;t make sense to me. They have a bunch of numbers and either L or RGB at the end of the file names. Can someone help me make sense of these?

                              <span>I first tried this experiment back in January and it kinda tripped me out. I used the wonder AI. When I tried the experiment with the Wombo dream AI the results were completely random. I wonder what the results would be with Midjourney. I later revisited the experiment in June with the wonder AI and again got intriguing results. Posting this just as an experiment in the hopes others will try it and see if it is repeatable and if other AI have more consistent results than others. It’s just an experiment, I don’t really care about your opinion I care about your results from trying this.

                              <span>Google and Universal Music are discussing licensing artists&#x27; voices and melodies to develop AI-generated songs fans can create and pay for, seeking to get ahead of the controversial &quot;deepfake&quot; music trend. Though some stars oppose their work being mimicked, artists could opt-in to receive royalties in a model akin to how YouTube now pays for user-generated content.
 For Google, AI music would boost its generative AI offerings against competitors. But significant ethical hurdles around consent and IP must still be addressed in developing a legitimate AI music market.

                              <span>So Llama 2 sounds awesome, but I really wanted to run it locally on my Macbook Pro instead of on a Linux box with an NVIDIA GPU. So I put the llama.cpp GGML models into the XetHub Llama 2 repo so I can use the power of Llama 2 locally. It now takes me 5 seconds to mount Llama 2 and it loads the GGML model almost instantly. Here’s how I did it:
  
Create an account: Go to xethub.com and Sign In with GitHub
 Quick start: Go to xethub.com/explore/quickstart and follow the Install &amp; Setup steps (xethub.com/explore/install)
 pip install pyxet for Python SDK and CLI
 Set up authentication: Create a Personal Access Token and then run the login command from a Terminal so your ~/.xetconfig is set up with your login token.
  
Here’s the code to get Llama 2 up and running on your Mac laptop in a few …</span>

                              <span>Hi Reddit folks, I wanted to share some benchmarking data I recently compiled running upstage_Llama-2-70b-instruct-v2 on two different hardware setups. If you&#x27;d like to see the spreadsheet with the raw data you can check out this link.
 Hardware Config #1: AWS g5.12xlarge - 4 x A10 w/ 96GB VRAM
 Hardware Config #2: Vultr - 1 x A100 w/ 80GB VRAM
 A few questions I wanted to answer:
  
How does the inference speed (tokens/s) between these two configurations compare?
 How does the number of input tokens impact inference speed?
 How many input tokens can these machines handle before they start to hit OOM?
 How does 4-bit vs 8-bit quantization affect all of the above?
  
Why this model?
 I chose upstage_Llama-2-70b-instruct-v2 because it&#x27;s the current #1 performing OS model on HuggingFace&#x27;s LLM…</span>

                              <span>Autonomous robots deployed in the real world will need control policies that rapidly adapt to environmental changes. To this end, we propose AutoRobotics-Zero (ARZ), a method based on AutoML-Zero that discovers zero-shot adaptable policies from scratch. In contrast to neural network adaption policies, where only model parameters are optimized, ARZ can build control algorithms with the full expressive power of a linear register machine. We evolve modular policies that tune their model parameters and alter their inference algorithm on-the-fly to adapt to sudden environmental changes. We demonstrate our method on a realistic simulated quadruped robot, for which we evolve safe control policies that avoid falling when individual limbs suddenly break. This is a challenging task in which two popular neural network baselines fail. Finally, we conduct a detailed analysis of our method on a novel and challenging non-stationary control task dubbed Cataclysmic Cartpole. Results confirm our findings that ARZ is significantly more robust to sudden environmental changes and can build simple, interpretable control policies.

                              <span>Machine perception uses advanced sensors to collect information about the surrounding scene for situational awareness. State-of-the-art machine perception using active sonar, radar, and LiDAR to enhance camera vision faces difficulties when the number of intelligent agents scales up. Exploiting omnipresent heat signals could be a new frontier for scalable perception. However, objects and their environment constantly emit and scatter thermal radiation, leading to textureless images famously known as the ‘ghosting effect’. Thermal vision thus has no specificity limited by information loss, whereas thermal ranging—crucial for navigation—has been elusive even when combined with artificial intelligence (AI). Here, we propose and experimentally demonstrate heat-assisted detection and ranging (HADAR) overcoming this open challenge of ghosting and benchmark it against AI-enhanced thermal sensing. HADAR not only sees texture and depth through the darkness as if it were day but also perceives decluttered physical attributes beyond RGB or thermal vision, paving the way to fully passive and physics-aware machine perception. We develop HADAR estimation theory and address its photonic shot-noise limits depicting information-theoretic bounds to HADAR-based AI performance. HADAR ranging at night beats thermal ranging and shows an accuracy comparable with RGB stereovision in daylight. Our automated HADAR thermography reaches the Cramér–Rao bound on temperature accuracy, beating existing thermography techniques. Our work leads to a disruptive technology that can accelerate the Fourth Industrial Revolution (Industry 4.0) with HADAR-based autonomous navigation and human–robot social interactions.

                              <span>I was watching this talk where they were showing that basically every task in machine learning has been replaced by the transformer architecture. For instance, where a convolution neural network might have been used for image recognition in the past, the predominant strategy now is just to use a transformer instead. How true is this? Is it worth learning any other architecture than transformers for current state of the art research?

 I am looking to spearhead the impending transition of understanding AI/ML at my organization and am looking for community suggestions in courses and bootcamps that could provide a deeper knowledge for some of my work projects in the future. Specifically, I feel unequipped in how to properly test and validate models. 
 I have a computer science background with strong skills in data analytics and programming. I’ve also taken several introductory courses at a high level for AI. 
 Does anyone have suggestions or experiences for 1-4 week long bootcamps or intensive courses? I prefer in-person (anywhere in US) but would also consider live-online remote courses. Price is not a concern. 
 Thanks in advance.

 I want to make an AI that is able to find out that there is an object, but it shouldnt need to know what the object is. I want the AI to be able to find objects in an image in realtime without needing to know what the object is. It&#x27;s supposed to grasp the concept of what an object is. Are there any methods or datasets that would make something like this possible?

                              <span>What are language retrieval models exactly?
 I&#x27;ve been hearing more and more of those in the context of not needing embeddings retrieval and putting useful text in the system prompt.
 How do they work in simple terms?

                              <span>Hey people, this time I am asking for your opinion. I am in automotive. I know ML very well due to personal projects but so far in my 5 years I never had the opportunity of applying it in the industry so I built expertise in classic CV Modelling instead. 
 Now there is an opportunity to work on newer topics like data generation, dataset curation or even ML based Fusion. Nevertheless I also got the opportunity to do SLAM and it excites me a lot because of the many things involved in it and the possibility to use parallelization and so on. What could be a nice strategy here in your opinion and why? I thank you all!

                              <span>would it be possible to train or fine-tune a small (1-3B) model who&#x27;s sole purpose is to perform function calls? similar to how we have tiny models like replit-v2-3B that are super capable at specific things like code auto-complete . 
 i know that&#x27;s how openAI implemented function call was by fine-tuning gpt-3.5/4 but I&#x27;m thinking just a straight up base model trained to understand and excel at function calls (similar to Gorilla for apis)
 i&#x27;m thinking it would be a perfect &quot;glue&quot; for bigger LLM apps-- avoiding the need for external tools like langchain/quidance/etc...

                              <span>I&#x27;m new to RL, and I was trying to train an agent to move items in a 2D grid. The agent needs to output the row number, column number, and item index, and right now I&#x27;m modeling them as discrete actions. I am not sure what kind of agent to use to solve this problem. I tried PPO, but I&#x27;m not sure what the output of the policy module should be in this case. I&#x27;d be grateful for any help.

 Studying Large Language Model Generalization with Influence Functions
 When trying to gain better visibility into a machine learning model in order to understand and mitigate the associated risks, a potentially valuable source of evidence is: which training examples most contribute to a given behavior? Influence functions aim to answer a counterfactual: how would the model&#x27;s parameters (and hence its outputs) change if a given sequence were added to the training set? While influence functions have produced insights for small models, they are difficult to scale to large language models (LLMs) due to the difficulty of computing an inverse-Hessian-vector product (IHVP). We use the Eigenvalue-corrected Kronecker-Factored Approximate Curvature (EK-FAC) approximation to scale influence functions up to LLMs with up to 52 billion parameters. In our experiments, EK-FAC achieves similar accuracy to traditional influence function estimators despite the IHVP computation being orders of magnitude faster. We investigate two algorithmic techniques to reduce the cost of computing gradients of candidate training sequences: TF-IDF filtering and query batching. We use influence functions to investigate the generalization patterns of LLMs, including the sparsity of the influence patterns, increasing abstraction with scale, math and programming abilities, cross-lingual generalization, and role-playing behavior. Despite many apparently sophisticated forms of generalization, we identify a surprising limitation: influences decay to near-zero when the order of key phrases is flipped. Overall, influence functions give us a powerful new tool for studying the generalization properties of LLMs.

                              <span>I hear AI &amp; ML used interchangeable, and a lot of people dispute the use of the term &quot;AI&quot;, as defining &quot;intelligence&quot; can be a sticky wicket. &quot;Machine learning&quot; seems like a much clearer term, describing systems that can optimize themselves given an objective function &amp; maybe training data (generalization). 
 But, I know ML is just a subset of AI, so is there any extant AI that isn&#x27;t ML? If not, what would AI that&#x27;s not ML look like?

                              <span>I’ve been kind of getting ChatGPT and Google Bard to generate subreddits, and look for me Cannabis sites, and shopping. (to be specific haha, well forums) It’s done a good job with some of the links, but a lot of times it kind of makes them up. Is there not an Ai that can deep dive or skim the web more accurately? Does it decipher filters like “time and date”, “availability”, “price”. More problems I’ve run into is it not being able to go really far back such as early internet or none indexed sites. Also noticed with Google and Bing they will give you the same results over and over (I assume I should have used “no repeats”) Google also will show me sold out items or items that aren’t actually on sale. It’ll show the item as say “on sale: $12.00” inspected the link- “$137” actually?? Any filter tips, or other Ai??

                              <span>If you&#x27;re creating voice-enabled products, I hope this will help you choose which model to use!
 I read the papers and docs for Bark and Tortoise TTS - two text-to-speech models that seemed pretty similar on the surface but are actually pretty different.
 Here&#x27;s what Bark can do:
  
It can synthesize natural, human-like speech in multiple languages.
 Bark can also generate music, sound effects, and other audio.
 The model supports generating laughs, sighs, and other non-verbal sounds to make speech more natural and human-sounding. I find these really compelling and these imperfections make the speech sound much more real. Check out an example here (scroll down to &quot;pizza.webm&quot;).
 Bark allows control over tone, pitch, speaker identity and other attributes through text prompts. 
 The model learns directly from text-audio pairs.
  
Whereas for Tortoise TTS:
  
It excels at cloning voices using just short audio samples of a target speaker. This makes it easy to produce text in many distinct voices (like celebrities). I think voice cloning is the best use case for this tool.
 The quality of the synthesized voices is pretty high.
 Tortoise supports fine-grained control of speech characteristics like tone, emotion, pacing, etc through priming text.
 Tortoise is only trained on English and it&#x27;s not capable of producing sound effects.
  
Here&#x27;s how they compare to the other speech-related models I&#x27;ve taken a look at so far:
  
 Model Best Use Cases Key Strengths 
  
 Bark Voice assistants, audio generation Flexibility, multilingual 
  Tortoise TTS Audiobooks, voice cloning Natural prosody, voice cloning 
  AudioLDM (full guide) Voice assistants High-quality speech and SFX 
  Whisper Transcription Accuracy, flexibility 
  Free VC Voice conversion Retains speech style 
 
 I have a full write-up here if you want to read more, it&#x27;s about a 10-minute read. I also looked at the model inputs and outputs and speculated on some products you can build with each tool.

                              <span>I see lots of people say AI will not be able to do movies / TV because it hallucinates yada yada yada. But, movies / TV shows follow a clear script. Script being a generic formula that is taught to script writers the same way as music theory cheat sheet helps aspiring musicians to write songs. 
 Script. Script can be turned into machine readable format. You can add commands how to render a movie on the basis of it. For example in a script you could have #Jack, telling the thing reading the script that we are talking of actor #Jack meaning it should tap into assets about jack which would reside in folder Jack. Jack meanwhile could be rendered by sub ai to fit the part. 
 That helps us nail down the character so it wont be changing appearance wise in our script.

                              <span>Thanks any answers or musings -
 what are some technical limitations (eg computing / storage power/speed) that (1) limits AI&#x27;s progress and (2) might be solved (and how), and (3) if solved, would make possible developments we can conceive of but not do yet?
 I&#x27;m just wondering if AI researchers forsee a kind of &#x27;leap forward&#x27; and what are some obstacles?

What I mean is that I train a model but when I ran the prediction, I just get an array of equivalent probabilities (0.25, 0.25, 0.25, 0.25). I have tried changing everything (making only one action to payoff for example) and still get the same error. Anyone has ran into a similar situation? Help please!

                              <span>I am currently addressing a challenge within the domain of Reinforcement Learning. The particular issue revolves around a dynamic action space, where the set of potential actions available changes based on the context or state. In light of this, I am seeking guidance on the feasibility of utilizing the Deep Q-Network (DQN) approach to specifically identify permissible actions for distinct states.
 Furthermore, if the DQN approach is not applicable in this scenario, I would appreciate recommendations for alternative algorithms that could effectively address this issue. Additionally, I am considering the option of designing a single action space and employing negative reward to discourage the agent from pursuing unauthorized actions within specific states.

I had it play 100k training games, but the loss scores increased over time, not decreased. I&#x27;ve got the (relatively short) implementation and the last few output graphs from the training--is there a problem with my model architecture or does it just need more training games, perhaps against a better opponent than itself? Here&#x27;s the notebook file. Thanks in advance

 I used the TransformReward on the enviroment, and seems that it&#x27;s working (changing the reward values).
 So here it is how it works the program:
 It calculates a reward per step based on the distance of the next state to the goal state. Also I tried adding some more constraints, like punishing if it stays on the same square or if it falls into a hole.
 The thing is that I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;m doing something wrong, so if someone can help me would be much appreciated. Here is part of the code, I&#x27;ll omit the neuro symbolic part because it&#x27;s irrelevant.
 The rewards are:

                              <span>I&#x27;m working on a RL Environment for my Masther Thesis where i try to explore the use of RL for Architectural Design. The environment looks like a 3D Grid of cubic 3D tiles or modules, and the agent can place tiles by choosing : Location (As x,y,z coordinates) , rotation (0 to 4 as multiples of 90 degrees around a z axis in the center) , and Tile Type (Im experimenting with many sets of tiles with different sizes). Then, I use Grasshopper3D to analyze the radiation that the interior surfaces and other metrics, that i use for my reward calculation. 
 For this, the state of the environment is defined as a 3D Array with 2 channels. One for the Tile Types and one for the rotations. This is processed by a 3D CNN features extractor. 
 The thing is that, I just realized that the array that represents the tile types as integers is actually categorical data, and I don&#x27;t know how well this could work in a CNN. What i mean by this is that a tile&#x3D;3 is not any more &quot;anything&quot; that a tile&#x3D;1, it is just different. 
 Am I doing something stupid then? Should i change it?
 I apologize if im saying something really dumb. I just got into RL few months ago : - )

 Would the ideal strategy be to find relating articles to topics, or topics relating to articles as they come in? What models would be ideal here? I’m fairly new to this, so any help would be appreciated.

                              <span>There have been many LLM inference solutions since the bloom of open-source LLMs. Most of the performant inference solutions are based on CUDA and optimized for NVIDIA GPUs. In the meantime, with the high demand for compute availability, it is useful to bring support to a broader class of hardware accelerators. AMD is one potential candidate.
 We build a project that makes it possible to compile LLMs and deploy them on AMD GPUs using ROCm and get competitive performance. More specifically, AMD Radeon™ RX 7900 XTX gives 80% of the speed of NVIDIA® GeForce RTX™ 4090 and 94% of the speed of NVIDIA® GeForce RTX™ 3090Ti for single batch Llama2-7B/13B 4bit inference. Besides ROCm, our Vulkan support allows us to generalize LLM deployment to other AMD devices, for example, a SteamDeck with an AMD APU.

                              <span>I am currently thinking about doing a PhD after I am done with my Master&#x27;s thesis because the topic of my thesis is so fascinating. However, I put the possibility of doing a PhD aside because I was always more &quot;hands-on&quot; rather than academic / research focused.
 Would you say a PhD in the intersection of embedded systems + machine learning (maybe training a model &quot;on the edge&quot; with the sensor data of the embedded device) is beneficial regarding finding a job afterwards?

                              <span>I&#x27;ve become interested in how LLMs express emotions through their responses. Here&#x27;s an example:
 [Q] &#x3D; I am having a bad day
 [R] &#x3D; I&#x27;m sorry to hear that you&#x27;re having a bad day. Is there anything specific you&#x27;d like to talk about or any way I can help you feel better? Whether it&#x27;s just a listening ear... 
 I am aware that LLMs are not conscious and have no real understanding of emotions. But it is clear from the example that they can produce emotionally appropriate responses. Is there some kind of systematic test that can be automated to verify this? I.e. given a text-based query and response determine if the response is empathetic.

 Do you have any tips on getting location from photographic images?
 Are there any open source neural nets for street view point clouds that can help?
 Is this an either/or problem or is it possible to use both data sources combined?

                              <span>Hi everyone, I have an interesting task in hand, and wanted some advice over here before getting my hands dirty.
 I have to compile a list of 15-20 papers, to systematically go from &quot;what&#x27;s a transformer&quot; to bleeding edge research of multimodal and LLMs applications to robotics, dynamical systems, and RL (e.g. RT-2). The base assumption is that the reader will be a master student, who already has the basics of what deep learning and control theory are.
 Could you suggest possible cornerstone papers that could go in this list? If you could, this would guide my search a lot, and I would appreciate it.

The last few years have seen rapid progress in systems that can automatically process complex business documents and turn them into structured objects. A system that can automatically extract data from documents, e.g., receipts, insurance quotes, and financial statements, has the potential to dramatically improve the efficiency of business workflows by avoiding error-prone, manual work. Recent models, based on the Transformer architecture, have shown impressive gains in accuracy. Larger models, such as PaLM 2, are also being leveraged to further streamline these business workflows. However, the datasets used in academic literature fail to capture the challenges seen in real-world use cases. Consequently, academic b…</span>

                              <span>I’m kind of new to the world of machine/deep learning so cut me some slack here, but I was wondering the best ways to train models (in my case a transformer) without a GPU. I personally don’t even have a PC, I’ve been using a 2017 MacBook Air. I know deep learning models are quite computationally expensive and since I don’t have access to a GPU, how do I train models? I’ve read about cloud computing services like AWS, Google Colab, etc. but I was wondering what the best method was. Ideally free or as cheap as possible.

                              <span>I have a regression model based on CNN, works reasonably well with less than 1M parameters. I am trying to check how Visual Transformer (ViT) will perform on this task, but due to lack of pooling in ViT, model size is considerably large (~10M parameters). Do ViT have anything equivalent to pooling to reduce number of parameters?
 If not then that reduces applicability of ViT to large models on large dataset dataset only. For smaller tasks with small dataset, CNN or Resnet are way more computation efficient.
 Or am I missing something?

                              <span>For our R&amp;D team, we spent over a month trying to setup our pipeline. After that, we spend at least 5 days after R&amp;D for to put a model into production without the required data pipelines that communicate with our model and the service. For training a model, the infrastructure maintain and manage it also needs to be built for around 2 weeks. 
 Currently, our best solution is to offload the training process by purchasing a GPU and keeping it in the office.

 Hi everyone!
 I want to share some interesting observations that indicate a very simple periodical weights resetting procedure could serve as an implicit regularization strategy for training DL models. This technique also shows potential connection with the Double Descent phenomenon. Here&#x27;s the link to github etc: https://github.com/amcircle/weights-reset.
 As a co-author of this study, I must apologize in advance for its brevity. However, I sincerely hope it may prove useful to some. I would gladly respond to your queries and receive your criticism. Your personal experiences related to something similar would also be highly appreciated.

                              <span>Hi,
 I am going through research papers and noticed that most of the papers talk about the text conditioned image generation process (reverse diffusion process). The text and time encodings are added as additional channels to the UNet block.
 However, I am curious to know if any text encodings are used during the training process as well. Is there any preview of the training datasets that is available which is used in the training process ? or a code snippet that points out to the forward part of the training loop
 Thanks

                              <span>Hi everyone,
 There has been a lot of work on benchmarking autoregressive LLMs, such as HF LLM Leaderboard, but I have not seen much work specifically on the relevancy of such LLMs for retrieval. 
 There is a lot of talk about chat based on knowledge with solutions like llama_index, where LLMs both provide embeddings and answer based on most similar content, but embedding and answer generation need not be the same LLM.
 I saw the Massive Text Embedding Benchmark (MTEB) but it does not seem to contain a lot of information about the recent autoregressive LLMs. 
 Are the recent autoregressive LLMs, e.g. Llama 2, actually performing better than Bidirectional LLMs such as BERT? 
 Because if so, all the recent fancy chat with your documents projects could use much smaller models to do embedding extraction for retrieval and just call a fancy autoregressive LLM such as GPT4 for answer synthesis.

For example the values of the x,y axis and their labels, weather the chart is increasing or decreasing. 
 I&#x27;ve worked with image captioning models such as BLIP before as I have used them in projects involving stable diffusion, but this model doesn&#x27;t give specifics about the information in the graph, just a brief overview. 
 I know researches have worked on this problem in the past using the vistext dataset: 
 https://news.mit.edu/2023/researchers-chart-captions-ai-vistext-0630
 So far I&#x27;m thinking that it may come to me finetuning BLIP or equivalent to specialize on infographics instead. 
 Thoughts?

I&#x27;m pretty sure I saw a demo like this at a code conference using Azure but I&#x27;m hoping for something self-hosted to avoid API fees. I was exploring coding something to do this for me but I don&#x27;t want to put in the work if something with a UI exists already. This seemed like the best place to ask.

                              <span>Hi - I have trained a pytorch model that does some fairly simple object classification - The goal is distribute it as part of an app, that will pull information from a user&#x27;s video.
 The videos are typically ~25-30 minutes and about 1GB in size, only a 600x600px square on the bottom right of the video is needed for the classification (it&#x27;s a minimap in a video game)
 The app is electron based
 Ideally I want to input a video, and extract the labels from the cropped section once per second.
 ​
 My current attempt involves converting the model to a tensorflowjs model, and rendering the video on a  element, stretching it so only the minimap is visible on the canvas, running the model, saving the labels, and increasing the current time of the video by 1 second, and repeating until the video is done.
 ​
 This seems like a terrible plan, but it&#x27;s much better than the couple of other ideas I&#x27;ve tried (using ffmpeg to extract a frame every second for example)
 ​
 Any advice appreciated!
 ​
 Edit: just to clarify this will only ever be ran on Windows

                              <span>Hello, I&#x27;m looking for a model (probably two models) that would:
  
Summarize reviews (e.g. website review) to two/three words.
 
Reuse these words or &quot;review tokens&quot; to tag reviews with similar content. Then if a review&#x27;s content differs (e.g. cosine sim. of 0.2), another tag will be generated from the review that diverges.
 
 Is there anything like this on the &quot;market&quot;?

 I am just about to finish Andrew NG&#x27;s course 3 courses on ML specialization and I have had 2 courses on ML as well in my Business Intelligence Analytics studies at uni. 
 Now I am extremely interested in ML but I see there are wide diaspora of different subfields you can focus on. I need to get into the job market as fast as possible. So can anyone guide me which aspect of ML should I give most of my time to practice and build portfolio that would translate well to interviews and hiring?
 Thank you

                              <span>How would you proceed on a project in assessing the difficulty level of a question? I tried using lexicographic metrics like flesh-kincaid score, etc., but those did not yield proper results. Is there a good method I could use? Also, how could I assess the &quot;readability&quot; of a question, or in other words, how easy it is to understand what the question is asking.

 Overall it is a hierarchical latent diffusion modeland generates complete linked musical phrases at good quality.

                              <span>A lot of my PhD work will be in using different types of ML/NN approaches to characterizing problems in my field. It&#x27;s kind of weird, since for my undergrad I came from a more traditional science background where we research off papers that were written like 2-20 years ago. Since a lot of these architectures and whatever are updating so fast, I wanted to see if there&#x27;s a good way to keep up with the latest information so my work wouldn&#x27;t be outdated by the time I publish. Is there a general workflow that those of you in the field follow in regards to this?

                              <span>Hey all, I have a technical background, having studied engineering and ML at one of the world&#x27;s leading universities. I really enjoyed it and did well, but long story short, since graduating (coming to 2 years) I have been working in a Family Office, doing things I don&#x27;t feel are very related.
 I wanted to know what kind of things I can do to keep myself in the loop and continue developing my ML/DS skills in my spare time. Alternatively, ideas of projects I could have just to make sure I have a portfolio?

Hugging Face recently released detailed evaluation data that includes per task performance. I made a sortable leaderboard here https://huggingface.co/spaces/CoreyMorris/MMLU-by-task-Leaderboard . You can also make custom scatter plots on the site so you can explore the relationship between parameter count and performance.

                              <span>At first, with InstructGPT and ChatGPT, it looked like RLHF was the holy grail to successfully finetune LLMs on human preferences. Then, from May 2023 onwards, a trend of doing just SFT with high-quality data showed up (e.g. &quot;LIMA: Less Is More for Alignment&quot; https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.11206) as an alternative to doing RLHF.
 What&#x27;s your opinion on these two narratives? Is RLHF likely to still be relevant even in the presence of SFT with high-quality data?

 I am currently already working in the field of ML research at a big name medical research center. Our main focus is in application of ML methods with the focus on stroke diagnostics and treatment.
 Now, I am quite happy working here but my background is somewhat interdisciplinary. I have a bachelor&#x27;s in Life science and a Master in bioinformatics. Because of this I always feel like I have to catch up to my colleagues when it comes to ML and in parts also computer science knowledge. It feels like there are a million things to learn and many small details to know that I am not even sure how to look up.
 I am curious what your experience has been if you were/are in a similar situation? How did you manage to catch up?

 This paper aims to provide an in-depth explanation of representing and propagating wavefunctions in a hierarchical manner using Gaussian basis functions. Wavefunctions are mathematical descriptions of the quantum states of physical systems and are fundamental to quantum mechanics. However, representing complex wavefunctions for real-world quantum systems remains a key challenge. This paper proposes using multiple layers of Gaussian basis functions, with trainable amplitudes, to represent wavefunctions in a hierarchical fashion and enable wavefunction propagation between layers.
 Understanding wavefunction representation and propagation has significant implications in diverse fields like quantum computing, quantum chemistry, and materials science. Efficient wavefunction man…</span>

                              <span>I’ve been researching the Evol-Instruct datasets now for a few days and have decided I want to build my own out for a specific use case.
 I’ve read literally everything possible, admittedly not much outside of WizardLM and GeorgiaTech, but I’ve read it.
 I was hoping to discuss it here with smarter people. 
 I’m seeing this as a way to use LLMs to generate great datasets. However, my use case doesn’t really exist in any models yet. Not thoroughly enough to produce a good Evol-Instruct set. So, I’m going to do that tomorrow.
 I’m going to use The Blokes WizardCoder-Guanaco 15b GPTQ version to train on my specific dataset - about 10GB of clean, really strong data I’ve spent 3-4 weeks putting together.
 In theory, I’ll use the Evol-Instruct script from WizardLM to generate the new dataset, and then I’ll apply that to whatever model I decide to use. There is a good chance I train my own on general Evol-Instruct datasets available now, and likely quite a large one.
 I’m looking for any tips, discussion, ideas, thoughts from the community. 
 Cheers!

                              <span>Hi there 👋,
 I&#x27;m excited to share a project I&#x27;ve been working on over the past few months!
 My primary goal is to create a service that will be beneficial for people. Please share your thoughts on this idea, and suggest any new features you think I should implement!
 Exciting Features:
 • Speak to Write: with this feature, you can speak your thoughts or information and the tool will transcribe it into text. The best part? You can then forward the transcribed text to any application with just one click.
 • Audio to Action Plan: the service can transform a received audio message into a structured list of elements or bullet points. This feature is especially useful for outlining an action plan or item list.
 • Speak in and Language: you can dictate an audio message in your native language, and the service will translate it into any other language, maintaining high translation quality—significantly better than Google Translate.
 • Meeting Transcripts &amp; Summaries: the service is perfect for converting recorded audio from meetings into text and generating concise summaries. It supports the upload of users&#x27; files.
 Thank you for taking the time to check it out. I look forward to hearing your feedback. You can access the service by visiting this link: https://audionotes.ai

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been using this today whilst I&#x27;ve been working and I found it pretty comical at first with the voice that talks to you, but now I&#x27;m starting to love it! I want it to talk more when it does talk. It feels like a nice break in the music to have the AI talk like a radio host. I&#x27;m sure some people would rather that not being a feature (if they use it at all), but I&#x27;d love for it to have some more comedic one-liners, possible news updates, and potentially traffic updates based on location and if it knows you&#x27;re driving. Would be awesome! 
 It&#x27;s also a really good tool for if you want to listen to music you&#x27;ve not heard before. Whether it&#x27;s part of your usual genre or not.
 Looking forward to seeing how this progresses!

                              <span>Hi everyone.
 I am an artist. And programmer, and kind of a bit of everything. But what is important, is that I was an artist before the current &quot;generative AI&quot; was a thing, and I have been drawing, digitally and traditionally alike for like... a decade?
 Art, to me, is getting what is inside your head, and presenting it to others outside of your consciousness and thoughts. It&#x27;s showing the world a piece of your interpretation, your experience, your impressions of the world you inhabit. It&#x27;s about communicating to others your emotions, your ideas, your thoughts and feelings.
 Not everyone can draw, or paint, or sculpt. I could say &quot;learn it, it&#x27;s easy&quot;, but that would be a lie. It isn&#x27;t easy. It is years upon years of constant, hard work, requiring focus and dedication, and a passion for l…</span>

 I&#x27;m a software engineer passionate about AI, and recently I&#x27;ve been experimenting with making my first AI game. 
 In the game, you try to negotiate a price down on a watch with an AI-driven salesman, rewarding -or roasting lol- you depending on your bargaining skills.
 I’d be more than happy to get your thoughts and feedback on this idea, it&#x27;s the first application I&#x27;ve built using AI so any tips would be much appreciated! 
 Thanks!

Obviously, Minecraft is a HUGE game and has thousands of videos posted every day... This is why I want to know if there is an AI that can rate videos based on editing, audience engagement, sound, etc... Also giving areas of improvement and the strengths of the video.
 Probably a big ask and SO far fetched, but there&#x27;s always a chance of something being out there.

Adaptive computation refers to the ability of a machine learning system to adjust its behavior in response to changes in the environment. While conventional neural networks have a fixed function and computation capacity, i.e., they spend the same number of FLOPs for processing different inputs, a model with adaptive and dynamic computation modulates the computational budget it dedicates to processing each input, depending on the complexity of the input.


Adaptive computation in neural networks is appealing for two key reasons. First, the mechanism that introduces adaptivity provides an inductive bias that can play a key role in solving some challenging tasks. For instance, enabling different num…</span>

 Very interesting blog post from OpenCV.ai team about how can explore ChatGPT to serve for code development debugging.
 Introduction from the article:
 As programmers, we often work with familiar development environments, but occasionally we encounter new tools that can be time-consuming and challenging to learn. In such situations, having virtual assistance can be extremely beneficial.
 In this article, I will share my experience of contributing to OpenCV, a renowned open-source library, despite having limited knowledge of C++ and understanding its architecture. I achieved this with the assistance of ChatGPT, a Large Language Model (LLM).
 I hope you can find it interesting. More details are here.

                              <span>I want to study Reinforcement Learning, but the concepts are really hard and mathematical. Whenever I think I grasp something I forget it the next day completly. The Basic Concepts of MDP is the only thing which I think I understood. But I cant understand the Training algorithms like Sarsa or Q-Learning and DQN and their implementations. I am really frustrated and overwhelmed.
 Does anyone know some good resources to understand the concepts and implementations of RL?

                              <span>In Q-learning (image), episodes are run, in the sense that, the states are visited in the order they appear as part of one sequence in an episode.
 In Dyna-Q (image) (which is btw described to be the same as Q-learning when the planning portion is deleted), there doesn&#x27;t seem to be any iteration over the states of an episode. It just picks a state, applies the e-greedy policy on it to choose the action, learns, updates the model, then plans.
 Would Q-learning also work fine if we got rid of the &quot;episodes&quot; and just picked isolated state-action pairs?
 Thank you

                              <span>I know for image recognition there is a rough intuition that neural network lower layers learn low level features like edges, and the higher layers learn more complex compositions of the lower layer features. Is there a similar intuition about what a value network or policy network learns in deep RL? If there are any papers that investigate this that would be helpful

                              <span>I was just watching the documentary about the &#x27;greatest movie never made&#x27;, director Alejandro Jodorowsky&#x27;s vision of Frank Herbert&#x27;s Dune.
 There is a huge book that contains a storyboard version of the movie with lots of production art by artists Moebius, Chris Foss and HR Giger.
 The movie was to star Jodorowsky&#x27;s son as Paul Atriedes, Salvadore Dali as the Emperor, Orson Wells as Baron Harkonnen and Mick Jagger as Feyd.
 Could one of today&#x27;s AIs be &#x27;fed&#x27; Jodorowsky&#x27;s book and create a movie of his vision?
 Curious to know what your opinions are on this.
 Thanks.

                              <span>Hi, all,
 I would like to use batch reaction trend data to build a regression model. I&#x27;m wondering what is the best way to approach this.
 Here&#x27;s some background:
 Reaction Data: 
  
 Time (min) Pressure (bar) Temperature (°C) Flow (kg/h) Gas Total (kg) 
  
 1 10 70 502 8 
  2 10.1 71 498 16 
  ... ... ... ... ... 
  102 10.3 76 475 850 
 
 Output: Polymer property X
 The reaction continues until a gas total is met and the time this takes depends on the other variables.
 I have ~700 batches of data in a format similar to the above and would like to predict polymer property X. As the variables can change minute to minute I was thinking of binning the variables into 5 minute bins using the mean and using these as variables for linear regression or similar.
 Is this a valid approach or is there another way I can approach the problem?
 Thanks!

                              <span>Alexander Amini, a Postdoctoral Associate at MIT, well known for the MIT&#x27;s Introduction to Deep Learning Course, published a git repo called CAPSA for uncertainty prediction. This was introduced during the online course. The code was released under Thermis AI, Inc, a private company. He is the co-founder and CSO of the company. You can check how well the code was documented in the wayback machine. Recently, they removed the code base from the github and launched a pro version with selected companies as beta. The original repo (now called capsa-lite) was a great learning tool that I wanted to use. This was a quick way to try out different methods of uncertainty prediction using minimal code. Unfortunately, they have pulled all previous version of the code from the github repo. I was wondering if anyone knows a similar python package or has the old repo - would be really helpful!

 I&#x27;ve got a couple of questions specifically regarding the motherboard. One concern I have is whether the space between the two GPUs is sufficient, as I&#x27;m planning to set them up using NVLink. Additionally, I&#x27;m curious about the compatibility of the case and motherboard for effective air cooling ( not considering water cooling at the moment). Anyone else with dual 3090s who can give some insights on how they&#x27;ve managed temperatures and potential overheating issues?
 Lastly, would upgrading to a Ryzen 9 5900X prevent me from bottlenecking the GPU&#x27;s? 
 Would love to hear your feedback and suggestions!

I am trying to apply for jobs, but there are some few options for physicists (based on my geography). So, I am trying to learn some new skill for my future job. One option would be Machine Learning, which is on-demand and the field is growing. The other option is Quantum Computing. I can start a postdoc in quantum information theory as well.
 Each path, has its pros and cons, and the final decision is based on many factors. I just don&#x27;t have enough data and information to say which one is more secure in the future? Which one has less compete? And also, is it possible to get hired without any serious project in ML, and just self-taught?
 If you were me, which one would you pick?
 Thanks

                              <span>Hi all, 
 I&#x27;m looking apply to some top masters for machine learning in the UK, so I&#x27;m guessing you know which one I&#x27;m referring to. 
 I got some guidance from the application advisor, which state they like to look at the transcript the most to have an idea of my linear algebra, calculus and statistics ability. I got 70% in &quot;Maths for Computer Science&quot; and some other modules I strong first and 2:1 in some others, but in general my course wasn&#x27;t too mathematically intensive. I did BSc Computer Science. I have been working as SWE the past 3 years. 
 I have completed the following specialisation &quot;Mathematics for Machine Learning and Data Science Specialization&quot; and read &quot;Mathematics for Machine Learning&quot;, as learning about mathematics actually got me into ML. I have also covered the videos on 3Blue1Brown etc. The application advisor said that certs don&#x27;t really mean too much which is understandable. I can&#x27;t change the past in terms of BSc transcript, therefore I was thinking a project may be a good way to showcase this.
 Any tips on how to best showcase this or get across my ability would be extremely helpful?

                              <span>Hey, 
 I&#x27;ve been trying to build an ML workstation and was considering the idea of using two RTX 3090&#x27;s to get the extra VRAM instead of a single 4090. However, I&#x27;ve come across some confusion regarding whether they can share their VRAM or not. Do I need to run them via NVLink to achieve this? I believe PyTorch&#x27;s data parallelism splits the batches across both GPUs, but that wouldn&#x27;t effectively combine their VRAM right?
 Any advice or insights you can share on the topic would be highly appreciated!

                              <span>Hi folks.
 I am sure you know the running gags around “thin OpenAI wrapper” products. Instead of more toy products, I am doing an experiment with some “AI engineering” to come up with a solution that’s closer to being usable in actual production cases.
 My background is in project management and data engineering, and I’ve built large systems for big companies and worked as a consultant in the space.
 I’ve seen enough crappy data pipelines for a lifetime.
 Hence.
 I want to do something different: A thin AI wrapper is not sufficient for having reliable data pipelines that use OpenAI for schema management and inference
 So this leaves me with the following doubts:
 ​
  
How to scale code horizontally and vertically? Using third-party solutions? SNS/SQS/Kafka?
 How to log and trace? Langsmith? Custom solutions?
 How to extend reliably with my own data, and make it stateful?
  
Looking for your perspective
 ​
  
What do you think about the state of data engineering, MLOps, and infrastructure in AI companies?
 What do you think about how to scale properly the systems and prepare them for the future?
 In this code here, I do process some PDFs as a simple pipeline, what approaches do you think could be better?
  
My current thinking and the state of the project
 ​
  
I should create a formal scale of usability. I am looking for your input here.
 I should improve model consistency, extends the model with custom domain knowledge, and make an early attempt to build simple user agents in the domain
 What I have is a schema inference, contracting basics, and a way to structure unstructured data
 I’m about to create a memory component that manages the data stored in vector dbs, as a DWH for AI
 If I bring this use case that was not something available easily to the public before, how best do it?

                              <span>Hey there,
 I got 2x 4090 RTX with 24GB GDDR each.I often ran into the problem of
 CUDA out of memory. Tried to allocate X MiB (GPU 0; 23.65 GiB total capacity; 22.75 GiB already allocated; 96.81 MiB free; 22.76 GiB reserved in total by PyTorch) 
 I wonder if there is a way to take usage of both GPUs so the model is split onto both GPUs.
 When training models I use torch.nn.DataParallel to use both GPUs, but it seems like I am not doing it right for load the model.
 Can anyone help me? Both GPUs are available in the system - this has already been checked.

                              <span>humanscript is an inferpreter. A script interpreter that infers commands from natural language using AI. There is no predefined syntax, humanscripts just say what they want to happen, and when you execute them, it happens.
 https://github.com/lukechilds/humanscript
 This is a humanscript called tidy-screenshots. It takes an unorganised directory of screenshots and organises them into directories based on the month the screenshot was taken.It can be executed like any other script.

 The LLM inferpreted the humanscript into the following bash script at runtime.

 The code is streamed out of the LLM during inferpretation and executed line by line so execution is not blocked waiting for inference to finish. The generated code is cached on first run and will be executed instantly on subsequent runs, bypassing the need for reinferpretation.
 ​

 The humanscript inferpreter supports a wide range of LLM backends. It can be used with cloud hosted LLMs like OpenAI&#x27;s GTP-3.5 and GPT-4 or locally running open source LLMs like Llama 2.
 You can run humanscript in a sandboxed Docker environment with a single command if you want to have a play.

                              <span>lets say i have a set of images which contains sentences of text on it. now i want to generative images using some generative model with valid (meaningful) text in them. what i assume is just using gan or more powerful diffusion to generate images but i don&#x27;t think the generated images won&#x27;t contains valid text in them. i want the model to implicitly learn the text in the images without feeding external text or ocr on them. does any one know any paper trying to tackle this problem. 
 any comments on this by anyone.

                              <span>Hey folks,
 For the past 2 years I&#x27;ve been working on a library to automate the most tedious part of my own work - data loading, normalisation, typing, schema creation, retries, schema inference, evolution &amp; ddl generation, self deployment.. Basically, as you build better and better pipelines you will want more and more, and dlt supports those options.
 The value proposition of this library is to automate the tedious work you do, so you can focus on better things. 
 What&#x27;s special about dlt?
 In the easiest form, you shoot response.json() json at a function and it auto manages the typing normalisation and loading, kind of like a pandas df.to_sql() but with auto schema inference, versioning and evolution. It supports loading to files, databases, and soon table formats and vector dbs.
 In its most complex form, you can do almost anything you can want, from memory management, microbatching, multithreading, extraction DAGs, 1 line Airflow/git actions deployment, dbt runner, streamlit app for data discovery, sql client, atomic state dictionaries, etc.
 The library is in use with early adopters, and we are now working on expanding our feature set to accommodate the larger community. We are adding Athena + Iceberg and Weaviate vector dbs next.
 Free forever
 The library is open source and will forever be open source. We will not gate any features for the sake of monetisation - instead we will take a more kafka/confluent approach where the eventual paid offering would be supportive not competing.
 Call for Feedback!
 Feedback is very welcome and so are requests for features or destinations.
 I would particularly love to hear from you: What destinations are you looking for from such a tool? And what use cases do you usually have? I&#x27;m a data engineer so my knowledge is more around loading external sources to a common space.

                              <span>Staying on top of all changes, tools, and best practices with AI is getting increasingly hard. Each week I find just 1 piece of information that is most interesting across research, products, business news, and many more. No fluff guaranteed.
 Sharing the top research from this week&#x27;s edition:
 https://preview.redd.it/fa3b1u39nlgb1.png?width&#x3D;591&amp;format&#x3D;png&amp;auto&#x3D;webp&amp;s&#x3D;1ccd78136e3578396878fd9641605845f0309865
 Summary: Meta released their latest open-source model, Llama 2, in partnership with Microsoft’s Azure platform. But Microsoft also offers OpenAI models and is a major investor in the company (they paid $14B for 49%). So, confused Matt asks, why would Microsoft partner with Meta, when it might undermine their investment in OpenAI?
 💡 Answering the question:
  
Spreading the risk: OpenAI may have the first mover advantages, but this does not always last (e.g. Blackberry, Myspace, Yahoo). Microsoft is betting on AI but keeps the chips diversified on multiple players.
 It’s beside the point: regardless of who Microsoft supports, their game is to attract all AI utilization on Azure. It&#x27;s not about the tools but about the CPU/GPU cycles they can charge for. smart!
 The real AI gangsta: Microsoft is sitting on the holy trinity of AI now.
  
 Exclusive partnerships with top LLMs (OpenAI, Meta)
 Priority access to Nvidia GPUs
 And strategic assets like GitHub and Azure

                              <span>I’ve used several AI programs that work excellent on blurred/pixelated photos of human faces but beyond that, I have not had success finding a program that can render animals in similar way. I’m more looking for something that can make the quality of a pixelated photo of say, a dog, non pixelated. Or at least, much less pixelated. 
 The images I’m trying to use are just absolutely horrible and not fixable, or I am just not using the best programs for my purposes. Or the programs I’m looking for simply do not exist yet. 
 If you have any recommendations (Paid or free programs) please do share! I have a MacBook and an iPhone if that helps.
 Thank you! 💕

                              <span>Hello, im in need of an ai that could rewrite for example a pdf document changing the wording but keeping the meaning of the content. 
 Right now im a user of chatgpt plus, and trying to use code interpreter for that, ive managed to get what i want, but it isnt capable of rewriting more than two pages without crashing or simply stoping the process without any warning.
 I do not know if im using the prompting in a wrong way, any help would be apreciated, also, in case theres an ai out there capable of doing this in a better way id be glad to know about it.
 Thank you guys.

                              <span>I have these chiptune songs I made myself, and I want to know if there is any AI that can remaster them with real instruments, etc., like an old 8-bit video game song that is updated to a modern version in a remake. Is any already AI capable of doing that?

I&#x27;m a newbie and making my project on machine learning and the aim is create a programme to recognise a spice by feeding some chemical constituents, but I can&#x27;t find appropriate dataset for it. I have been searching for months, and now I&#x27;m a bit desperate, so I&#x27;m asking anyone interested for help...

                              <span>Hello I am attempting to reduce a matrix that is 57 by 256 to 57 to 128. I was attempting to use PCA but it failed as maximum size would be 57 by 57. I was also attempting an autoencoder but the syntax behind this is very confusing so If anyone could give me adivce that would be great. Thank you

                              <span>Hello,
 I have been working on an OpenAI-compatible API for serving LLAMA-2 models written entirely in Rust. It supports offloading computation to Nvidia GPU and Metal acceleration for GGML models !
 Here is the project link: Cria- Local LLAMA2 API
 You can use it as an OpenAI replacement (check out the included &#x60;Langchain&#x60; example in the project).
 This is an ongoing project, I have implemented the &#x60;embeddings&#x60; and &#x60;completions&#x60; routes. The &#x60;chat-completion&#x60; route will be here very soon!
 Really interested in your feedback and I would welcome any help :) !

I was wondering what other resources you guys have used that you would recommend that emphasize deep reinforcement learning for someone with some experience in shallow/classical reinforcement learning already and some experience with deep learning already, but new to deep reinforcement learning

                              <span>Hey! 
 I am working on a project to predict the best sequences of marketing channel so that sales is maximized. I have 20 ways of reaching out to the customer (email, phone, face2face...). I have 20 days of interaction history and it&#x27;s generated sales, recorded for past 2 years. I have to predict for the next 20 working days(1 month)
 So far, I have tried ensemble methods, svm, fully connected nn, etc. But it is quite apparent that these are not good solutions. 
 Any suggestions on ml/dl methods? Papers, blogs or other resources would be much appreciated

                              <span>Greetings fellow researchers,
 I am 27, currently working remotely at a healthcare IT company based in Silicon Valley (6+ years in industrial research) where I apply deep learning methods and large language models. I recently received an exciting opportunity to pursue a PhD at the Technical University of Denmark (DTU) in a similar research area. 
 While I am grateful for my current position and compensation, Have published in NeurIPS, EMNLP, ACL, ACM etc (NLP) with really good citations under company. I feel unsatisfied with the learning opportunities available in company &amp; industry.
 I am strongly considering pursuing the DTU PhD program full-time, but wanted to get perspectives from others before making a decision. How strong is DTU&#x27;s AI research community?
 Given the rapid advances in large language models, is now an ideal time to immerse myself in academic research? There are many topics that interest me, including fairness, ethics, hallucinations, quantization, specialized domains like healthcare/finance, and federated learning combined with LLMs.
 Would appreciate any insights on whether moving into academia would be a wise choice at this stage versus remaining in industry. I welcome any suggestions or considerations I should keep in mind. 
 Thank you for taking the time to share your thoughts!

 I&#x27;m working on an RNN-based model that should learn how to guess the next character given a simple prompt based on all scripts from Friends to generate non-existing Friends dialogue. It is heavily inspired by Andrej Karpathy&#x27;s blog post on RNN&#x27;s. I&#x27;m mostly doing this for training, and because it&#x27;s pretty fun.
 I have a little experience with deep learning in the sense that I am familiar with most common architectures and have intermediate understanding of how deep learning models work and are trained. I haven&#x27;t created many models from scratch though, yet.
 Network
 My GRU is fairly simple. I&#x27;ll save you the exact code, but instead give a systematic overview of all network layers. It&#x27;s implemented with Pytorch:

                              <span>Hey.
 I&#x27;m currently working on an application that digitalizes text from physical book pages using Google&#x27;s Cloud Vision API.
 I&#x27;m looking to add a functionality that can recognize and highlight underlined words within the scanned pages. I initially thought this would be a common feature and expected to find existing open-source solutions or libraries that I could use. To my surprise, I&#x27;ve been unable to find any. 
 I am just really bad at finding it, or is this not as straightforward as I initially thought?

                              <span>Experts, I am a beginner here and seeking some advise here please.
 I am have compiled a high quality Q&amp;A dataset (around 1200 entries) for a domain specific topic.
 What&#x27;s the best course of action here to use LLM with that specific knowledge base?
 1) Finetuning a model? if so which one is a good candidate? OpenAI let&#x27;s me finetune some models and later, all my users have to do is use pass the model name to the API
 2) Use the regular vector database + embeddings for augmented retrieval
 
 I prefer (1) but I am not sure how it will perform.
 Option (2) should work, since we really just use semantic search to bring in context to the LLM, etc.
 I hope you can say that (1) works nicely, if not please help me learn why.
 Thank you in advance!

 Also is this (splitting prediction into 2 stages) a prominent paradigm in other areas of ML too? I am reading about something called the &quot;Action Transformer&quot; created by Adept AI, and it also has 2 stages: instruction generation and code generation.

                              <span>Web dev student here and I&#x27;m interested in knowing more about creating products that actually use AI to help its users (not products that just use GPT in the backend). More specifically, I want to build a food supply management app for restaurants for my school thesis. This app will use AI to analyse food supplies and assign them purchase priority, value, and complexity scores (maybe just priority if it&#x27;s too hard). Restaurant owners could then determine what foods should be purchased before others based on the priority scores.
 For example, a restaurant may only have 10 tomatoes left and the average usage of tomatoes in this restaurant is 12 per week. Based on this, a priority would be assigned to purchase x amount of tomatoes.
 Other factors that could be taken into account for the prior…</span>

 Basically i just need to post some text into one website everyday for my work 
 The problem is there are many steps involves to post one data value, I was wondering if there is a tool that can learn my tasks and then post some of the data to the website from google sheets? 
 I&#x27;m open to any suggestions and advice. 
 Thanks in advance.

                              <span>I want to convert a few books into audiobooks. Are there any AI options out there that are free and will give me something I can use offline? I typically listen to books on my phone while I&#x27;m out, so something like Edge browser isn&#x27;t going to work.
 I&#x27;ve heard that there are some great options, but I&#x27;ve only seen some web paid services, and for my purpose, it&#x27;s too expensive just to get an audiobook out of it. This is all just for personal use.

 My agent needs to learn to take one action in my environment and there are only two possible actions that the agent can take at each time step. The state is just the time step, so every episode has 240 time steps and the agent just needs to learn to take one optimal action out of two possible actions for every time step. I have set this up as simply as I can as a starting point to make sure the algorithm is implemented correctly and that the agent can learn. I am using n-step expected SARSA.
 The bottom plot shows the count for how many times the agent took each action during each episode. The middle plot has the temporal difference error in blue and the &quot;modelling error&quot; in orange. The modelling error is the difference between the actual discounted return and the TD target for each time step, summed up for each episode. The red line is the return that the agent would get if it took the optimal action in every time step.
 0.11, the blue line in the bottom plot, is the optimal action for the agent to take at every time step. The other action will never result in a reward other than 0. So it should be fairly simple for the agent to learn what action to take at every time step and it does learn that at the start. But then, as you can see in the top plot, the agent suddenly starts taking the non-optimal action more often after around episode 450. So I&#x27;m just wondering why that would happen. Why would the agent learn to take the optimal action at most time steps and then suddenly decide that it will start taking other actions?
 For more context, the learning rate is 0.6, n is 6, epsilon is decayed by 1/(n_episodes/1.1) every episode so it reaches 0 slightly before the final episode.
 Any ideas based on this information why the agent would decide to start taking the non-optimal action? Or any suggestions for how I could figure out why it would start taking the non-optimal action?

                              <span>The previous post looked at the swish function and related activation functions for deep neural networks designed to address the “dying ReLU problem.” Unlike many activation functions, the function f(x) is not monotone but has a minimum near x0 &#x3D; -1.2784. The exact location of the minimum is where W is the Lambert W function, […]

                              <span>Swish, mish, and serf are neural net activation functions. The names are fun to say, but more importantly the functions have been shown to improve neural network performance by solving the “dying ReLU problem.” Softplus can also be used as an activation function, but our interest in softplus here is as part of the definition […]

Do you guys think we will ever experience a sort of unstoppable super soldier when it comes to our police / swat forces ? We are replacing many jobs with robots. From surgery procedures in hospitals to flipping burgers. It’s not above the realm of possibility to think we may someday soon see a hybrid police force. What do you guys think ?

What would you suggest as some steps to take, both now and in the future, as I plan out my career? It looks like I am going to need to learn Python, but I&#x27;m not 100% sure, and there&#x27;s so little established in such a new field.

                              <span>Interesting experiment i thought of.
 What if we gave AI access to web browser, and let it do whatever it wants? It could create accounts on any social media, email accounts, ad comments everywhere and such.
 of course, ai by itself does not have any agenda or need to do anything, so ai would need to be fed some kind of personality simulation first. Lets say ai was either fed personality based on extensive twitter or reddit history of someone&#x27;s post. Using that, basic psychological traits, beliefs and maybe goals could be determined.
 Such ai would simulate person sitting in front of pc, so it would need to parse the content of webpages, but i don&#x27;t think it would be that of a problem. And it would maybe also have access to some bank account with some money to maybe pay for online subscriptions and such. But who knows, maybe thanks to simulating someone&#x27;s personality, it would attempt to donate money to some charity or lose it on onlyfans?

                              <span>While some schools have curbed the use of generative AI, the University of Hong Kong (HKU) is going all in and urging both its teachers and students to embrace the technology. The University of Hong Kong is supporting this by giving teachers and students free access to various generative AI tools, including Microsoft Azure OpenAI and OpenAI’s ChatGPT and DALL-E.[1]
 Intel’s CEO, Pat Gelsinger, has called NVIDIA the clear market leader who has done a great job within the AI space.[2]
 AI powerhouse, OpenAI has released some new features for its sensational chatbot, ChatGPT. The new features allow the chatbot to show suggested follow-up prompts at the bottom of its responses. The new features were announced by the company via a tweet on its official Twitter handle.[3]
 Asian Americans and women in the workforce are the most concentrated in fields where AI could assist or replace their job tasks, according to new research.[4]

                              <span>I’m a filmmaker and I’m just experimenting with AI. I just had fun crafting a film trailer to understand the today’s limits of these tools. I used Midjourney, Runway Gen-2, StableDiffusion, Premiere, After Effects. The movie it&#x27;s called &quot;The Phoenix&quot;, which hints at the film&#x27;s underlying theme of rising from the ashes, symbolizing female empowerment, all wrapped in a bit of sarcastic humor from a male perspective. 
 I&#x27;m sharing because I genuinely want to know what you guys think. Any and all thoughts are welcome.
 If you&#x27;re curious about the workflow or the process behind the creation of this trailer, I&#x27;d be happy to share more.

This is different with conventional transformer in a sense that we don’t have access to future information, so how do we change the training strategy? Also, it’s inefficient if we use the entire history; are there any smart way to select which frame in the past to keep?

I just don&#x27;t know that much about their construction. I understand how they work, but I&#x27;m probably behind the latest developments in tokenizers.
 So, I thought it wisest to reach out to the community for advice or clarity.
 Context:
 I&#x27;ve collected about 15 GB of data over the last month. It&#x27;s incredibly clean and well-organized. The core goal of the data is to train a model to solve or assist with a particular development problem. This means that much of my data is a code/natural language mix. It&#x27;s delimited clearly, and the formatting is uniform. The entire dataset has been normalized and standardized. It&#x27;s taken me a lot of time to produce and that&#x27;s…</span>

                              <span>Hi everyone,
 With the recent boom of LLMs, we have seen both ends of the spectrum advance at a very fast pace, from OpenAI GPT4, which runs on huge data centers operated by Azure, to llama.cpp, which runs on consumer laptops.
 While both have their pros and cons, for instance, open-source models on decentralized compute reduce the need to trust or rely on centralized actors like Cloud providers, the efficiency of running training/inference on personal setups is not often discussed.
 I am therefore interested in learning how more energy/cost efficient it is to train/serve AI models on data centers vs doing it on personal computers. 
 Do you know if there have been studies? 
 In theory, I guess that several factors, such as economies of scale, use of renewable energy sources in some data centers, such as Canada, advanced cooling systems and advanced hardware, make data centers more cost/energy efficient.
 I guess some modeling on a precise use case where we fix some variables could help have an idea. For instance, one could ask, what is the energy/cost/time needed to predict 1 billion tokens from a Llama 2 70B in a data center with X amount of A100s, vs on Y different consumer CPU / GPUs.
 If anyone has references to models or past studies I would be quite interested. Of course, using data centers implies trusting those people, but I am not considering that factor for this discussion as I am focusing on understanding best what is the best setup to have optimal enrgy/cost/time for AI.

                              <span>Hi guys
 Im looking for groups or communities where i could discuss about certain topic. Im a software developer and a mechanical engineer and recently made an app that combines gpt4 model to perform engineering tasks like CAD models creation and performing stress analysis. I would like find people who share the same passion and perhaps would like to discuss about that, exchange the concepts, ideas and visions. Im getting to the point where i will need to implement own trained model and im no ML expert so would be great to discuss about the architecture etc. 
 Here is a demo of my app

                              <span>Hi, I am a new starter with ML apps and want to build a first app preferably using existing (trained) models. The idea is an app that takes a text description of a wished kick drum (for example: create a 808 kick with enhanced subs and filtered above 15kHz) and then generates a corresponding hifi sample of the description (44,1k or 48k). 
 I would like to learn how to do that with some peers happy to help me.
 As said this would be my first attempt. About me: I only followed Deep Learning theoretical courses from Andrew Ng and never built or used existing models so I&#x27;d appreciate some guidance if you are interested to support. Thanks a lot

 import torch import torch.nn as nn class MultiHeadSelfAttention(nn.Module): def __init__(self, nheads&#x3D;8, dim&#x3D;512, bias&#x3D;True, dropout&#x3D;0.2): super().__init__() assert dim % nheads &#x3D;&#x3D; 0, &quot;dimension must be divisible by number of heads&quot; self.nheads &#x3D; nheads self.dim &#x3D; dim self.head_dim &#x3D; dim // nheads self.scale &#x3D; self.head_dim**-0.5 self.softmax &#x3D; nn.Softmax(dim&#x3D;-1) self.dropout &#x3D; nn.Dropout(dropout) self.to_keys &#x3D; nn.Linear(dim, self.dim_heads * nheads, bias&#x3D;bias) self.to_queries &#x3D; nn.Linear(dim, self.dim_heads * nheads, bias&#x3D;bias) self.to_values &#x3D; nn.Linear(dim, self.dim_heads * nheads, bias&#x3D;bias) self.to_out &#x3D; nn.Linear(self.dim_heads * nheads, dim, bias&#x3D;bias) def change_shape(self, x): b_size &#x3D; x.shape[:-1] return x.reshape(*b_size, self.nheads, self.head_dim) def forward(self, x, mask&#x3D;True): q &#x3D; self.change_shape(self.to_queries(x)) k &#x3D; self.change_shape(self.to_keys(x)) v &#x3D; self.change_shape(self.to_values(x)) dot_score &#x3D; q @ k.transpose(-2, -1) * self.scale if mask: tril &#x3D; torch.tril(torch.ones(dot_score.shape[-2:])) dot_score &#x3D; dot_score.masked_fill(tril &#x3D;&#x3D; 0, float(&quot;-inf&quot;)) attn &#x3D; self.softmax(attn) attn &#x3D; self.dropout(attn) out &#x3D; torch.einsum(&quot;bnk,bnd-&gt;bnd&quot;, attn, v) b_size &#x3D; out.shape[:-2] out &#x3D; out.view(*b_size, -1) return self.to_out(out)

                              <span>In the forward process of diffusion models, gaussian noise is added -- when this is done, is the resulting &quot;noisy image&quot; clipped to be within the pixel-value bounds (ie [0, 255] or [0, 1]), or is it allowed to exceed these limits? 
 Clipping makes sense as there is no interpretation for pixel values which exceed these limits.
 On the other hand, the problem with clipping is that if the added noise is clipped, you are not adding truly gaussian noise, which seems problematic as much of the theory behind diffusion models assumes true gaussian noise. 
 Any ideas about what is done in practice, and whether or not this has implications from a theoretical standpoint?

 So I am currently creating a dataset in a team of three. This dataset is aimed to create a object detection model for around 11 classes. We have aimed to label around approx. 4000. Our current workflow is a couple of scripts scraping from Pinterest and using Label Studio for labeling. We labeled approx. 25% to our goal but realized that we are about to burn out. We&#x27;d prefer that whatever solution there is is self hosted and not paid.
 Thoughts? is there some kind of workflow we are missing to create a dataset?

                              <span>Hi all, 
 I&#x27;m interested in redesigning my application to utilize an open-source embeddings model and a different vector DB. My current issue with embeddings is that processing large volumes of data into a vector DB using ada-002 is unreliable, with frequent API timeouts occurring or issues interacting with Pinecone. This is super problematic as it&#x27;s difficult to track which data has / hasn&#x27;t been stored correctly. I also know that many open-source embeddings models are more performant and will allow for more long term control over my data. 
 However, the advantage of using OpenAI / Pinecone has of course been simplicity in production and not having to worry about queries / retrieval working efficiently. To give context, I&#x27;m dealing with a large volume of documents, such that if I were to embed my documents into a FAISS index with a small sentence transformers model, it would constitute 12GB, so a really simple solution like storing within the same application database is probably a no-go.
 In initiating this switch, I want to know the best approach towards: 
 A) Utilizing an open-source embeddings model in a production context (is it best to host as an API via a cloud provider and what are some considerations I should think about? What&#x27;s a fast / reliable way of setting this up? I would like prioritise a more simple approach if possible.) 
 B) What Vector DB I should be looking into as an alternative and what&#x27;s the best way to achieve self-hosted so that it would be equally performant compared to hosted services like pinecone (Docker? AWS?)?

                              <span>SARSA is a TD algorithm for control (learning optimal policies). In the book it&#x27;s written like this: image. The idea is to learn the action-value function instead of the value function for a policy that we keep improving (using GPI). Once we learn the converged action-value function for all states, the optimal policy is greedily derived from the action-value function (basically take the most promising action at each state).
 In contrast, TD for value estimation is written like this: image. Here we keep the policy fixed and just keep iterating over the multiple episodes, whilst refining the value estimate.
 My question is, why can&#x27;t we just change TD for value estimation to just greedily update the policy at each stage? That would be in the spirit of generalized policy iteration (GPI) too. In other words, a version of SARSA which doesn&#x27;t use action-value functions, but instead use value functions?

                              <span>Clustering analysis of sequence data continues to address many applications
in engineering design, aided with the rapid growth of machine learning in
applied science. This paper presents an unsupervised machine learning algorithm
to extract defining characteristics of earthquake ground-motion spectra, also
called latent features, to aid in ground-motion selection (GMS). In this
context, a latent feature is a low-dimensional machine-discovered spectral
characteristic learned through nonlinear relationships of a neural network
autoencoder. Machine discovered latent features can be combined with
traditionally defined intensity measures and clustering can be performed to
select a representative subgroup from a large ground-motion suite. The
objective of efficient GMS is to choose characteristic records representative
of what the structure will probabilistically experience in its lifetime. Three
examples are presented to validate this approach, including the use of
synthetic and field recorded ground-motion datasets. The presented deep
embedding clustering of ground-motion spectra has three main advantages: 1.
defining characteristics the represent the sparse spectral content of
ground-motions are discovered efficiently through training of the autoencoder,
2. domain knowledge is incorporated into the machine learning framework with
conditional variables in the deep embedding scheme, and 3. method exhibits
excellent performance when compared to a benchmark seismic hazard analysis.</span>

                              <span>(Economic) nonlinear model predictive control ((e)NMPC) requires dynamic
system models that are sufficiently accurate in all relevant state-space
regions. These models must also be computationally cheap enough to ensure
real-time tractability. Data-driven surrogate models for mechanistic models can
be used to reduce the computational burden of (e)NMPC; however, such models are
typically trained by system identification for maximum average prediction
accuracy on simulation samples and perform suboptimally as part of actual
(e)NMPC. We present a method for end-to-end reinforcement learning of dynamic
surrogate models for optimal performance in (e)NMPC applications, resulting in
predictive controllers that strike a favorable balance between control
performance and computational demand. We validate our method on two
applications derived from an established nonlinear continuous stirred-tank
reactor model. We compare the controller performance to that of MPCs utilizing
models trained by the prevailing maximum prediction accuracy paradigm, and
model-free neural network controllers trained using reinforcement learning. We
show that our method matches the performance of the model-free neural network
controllers while consistently outperforming models derived from system
identification. Additionally, we show that the MPC policies can react to
changes in the control setting without retraining.</span>

                              <span>Continual learning is a promising machine learning paradigm to learn new
tasks while retaining previously learned knowledge over streaming training
data. Till now, rehearsal-based methods, keeping a small part of data from old
tasks as a memory buffer, have shown good performance in mitigating
catastrophic forgetting for previously learned knowledge. However, most of
these methods typically treat each new task equally, which may not adequately
consider the relationship or similarity between old and new tasks. Furthermore,
these methods commonly neglect sample importance in the continual training
process and result in sub-optimal performance on certain tasks. To address this
challenging problem, we propose Relational Experience Replay (RER), a bi-level
learning framework, to adaptively tune task-wise relationships and sample
importance within each task to achieve a better &#x60;stability&#x27; and &#x60;plasticity&#x27;
trade-off. As such, the proposed method is capable of accumulating new
knowledge while consolidating previously learned old knowledge during continual
learning. Extensive experiments conducted on three publicly available datasets
(i.e., CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and Tiny ImageNet) show that the proposed method
can consistently improve the performance of all baselines and surpass current
state-of-the-art methods.</span>

                              <span>Unsupervised multiplex graph learning (UMGL) has been shown to achieve
significant effectiveness for different downstream tasks by exploring both
complementary information and consistent information among multiple graphs.
However, previous methods usually overlook the issues in practical
applications, i.e., the out-of-sample issue and the noise issue. To address the
above issues, in this paper, we propose an effective and efficient UMGL method
to explore both complementary and consistent information. To do this, our
method employs multiple MLP encoders rather than graph convolutional network
(GCN) to conduct representation learning with two constraints, i.e., preserving
the local graph structure among nodes to handle the out-of-sample issue, and
maximizing the correlation of multiple node representations to handle the noise
issue. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed method achieves
superior effectiveness and efficiency over the comparison methods and
effectively tackles those two issues. Code is available at

                              <span>The development of technologies for causal inference with the privacy
preservation of distributed data has attracted considerable attention in recent
years. To address this issue, we propose a data collaboration quasi-experiment
(DC-QE) that enables causal inference from distributed data with privacy
preservation. In our method, first, local parties construct
dimensionality-reduced intermediate representations from the private data.
Second, they share intermediate representations, instead of private data for
privacy preservation. Third, propensity scores were estimated from the shared
intermediate representations. Finally, the treatment effects were estimated
from propensity scores. Our method can reduce both random errors and biases,
whereas existing methods can only reduce random errors in the estimation of
treatment effects. Through numerical experiments on both artificial and
real-world data, we confirmed that our method can lead to better estimation
results than individual analyses. Dimensionality-reduction loses some of the
information in the private data and causes performance degradation. However, we
observed that in the experiments, sharing intermediate representations with
many parties to resolve the lack of subjects and covariates, our method
improved performance enough to overcome the degradation caused by
dimensionality-reduction. With the spread of our method, intermediate
representations can be published as open data to help researchers find
causalities and accumulated as a knowledge base.</span>

prior knowledge for new tasks, encouraging faster learning and good
generalization for new tasks. This article gives a detailed view of these

prevalent trait in the literature. There are numerous research papers that

research studies that combine (two of) these learning algorithms. This survey

                              <span>The ability to quickly learn a new task with minimal instruction - known as
few-shot learning - is a central aspect of intelligent agents. Classical
few-shot benchmarks make use of few-shot samples from a single modality, but
such samples may not be sufficient to characterize an entire concept class. In
contrast, humans use cross-modal information to learn new concepts efficiently.
In this work, we demonstrate that one can indeed build a better ${\bf visual}$
dog classifier by ${\bf read}$ing about dogs and ${\bf listen}$ing to them
bark. To do so, we exploit the fact that recent multimodal foundation models
such as CLIP are inherently cross-modal, mapping different modalities to the
same representation space. Specifically, we propose a simple cross-modal
adaptation approach that learns from few-shot examples spanning different
modalities. By repurposing class names as additional one-shot training samples,
we achieve SOTA results with an embarrassingly simple linear classifier for
vision-language adaptation. Furthermore, we show that our approach can benefit
existing methods such as prefix tuning, adapters, and classifier ensembling.
Finally, to explore other modalities beyond vision and language, we construct
the first (to our knowledge) audiovisual few-shot benchmark and use cross-modal
training to improve the performance of both image and audio classification.</span>

interconnected challenges in smart grid systems. Addressing these issues
collectively is crucial for ensuring system security. This paper addresses the
interconnected challenges of ETD and ECF in smart grid systems. The proposed
solution combines long short-term memory (LSTM) and a denoising diffusion
probabilistic model (DDPM) to generate input reconstruction and forecasting. By
leveraging the reconstruction and forecasting errors, the system identifies

the proposed scheme outperforms baseline methods in ETD and ECF problems. The

                              <span>Efficient exploration in complex environments remains a major challenge for
reinforcement learning (RL). Compared to previous Thompson sampling-inspired
mechanisms that enable temporally extended exploration, i.e., deep exploration,
we focus on deep exploration in distributional RL. We develop here a general
purpose approach, Bag of Policies (BoP), that can be built on top of any return
distribution estimator by maintaining a population of its copies. BoP consists
of an ensemble of multiple heads that are updated independently. During
training, each episode is controlled by only one of the heads and the collected
state-action pairs are used to update all heads off-policy, leading to distinct
learning signals for each head which diversify learning and behaviour. To test
whether optimistic ensemble method can improve on distributional RL as did on
scalar RL, by e.g. Bootstrapped DQN, we implement the BoP approach with a
population of distributional actor-critics using Bayesian Distributional Policy
Gradients (BDPG). The population thus approximates a posterior distribution of
return distributions along with a posterior distribution of policies. Another
benefit of building upon BDPG is that it allows to analyze global posterior
uncertainty along with local curiosity bonus simultaneously for exploration. As
BDPG is already an optimistic method, this pairing helps to investigate if
optimism is accumulatable in distributional RL. Overall BoP results in greater
robustness and speed during learning as demonstrated by our experimental
results on ALE Atari games.</span>

                              <span>Unsupervised representation learning approaches aim to learn discriminative
feature representations from unlabeled data, without the requirement of
annotating every sample. Enabling unsupervised representation learning is
extremely crucial for time series data, due to its unique annotation bottleneck
caused by its complex characteristics and lack of visual cues compared with
other data modalities. In recent years, unsupervised representation learning
techniques have advanced rapidly in various domains. However, there is a lack
of systematic analysis of unsupervised representation learning approaches for
time series. To fill the gap, we conduct a comprehensive literature review of
existing rapidly evolving unsupervised representation learning approaches for
time series. Moreover, we also develop a unified and standardized library,
named ULTS (i.e., Unsupervised Learning for Time Series), to facilitate fast
implementations and unified evaluations on various models. With ULTS, we
empirically evaluate state-of-the-art approaches, especially the rapidly
evolving contrastive learning methods, on 9 diverse real-world datasets. We
further discuss practical considerations as well as open research challenges on
unsupervised representation learning for time series to facilitate future
research in this field.</span>

                              <span>Precise and fast prediction methods for ischemic areas comprised of dead
tissue, core, and salvageable tissue, penumbra, in acute ischemic stroke (AIS)
patients are of significant clinical interest. They play an essential role in
improving diagnosis and treatment planning. Computed Tomography (CT) scan is
one of the primary modalities for early assessment in patients with suspected
AIS. CT Perfusion (CTP) is often used as a primary assessment to determine
stroke location, severity, and volume of ischemic lesions. Current automatic
segmentation methods for CTP mostly use already processed 3D parametric maps
conventionally used for clinical interpretation by radiologists as input.
Alternatively, the raw CTP data is used on a slice-by-slice basis as 2D+time
input, where the spatial information over the volume is ignored. In addition,
these methods are only interested in segmenting core regions, while predicting
penumbra can be essential for treatment planning. This paper investigates
different methods to utilize the entire 4D CTP as input to fully exploit the
spatio-temporal information, leading us to propose a novel 4D convolution
layer. Our comprehensive experiments on a local dataset of 152 patients divided
into three groups show that our proposed models generate more precise results
than other methods explored. Adopting the proposed 4D mJ-Net, a Dice
Coefficient of 0.53 and 0.23 is achieved for segmenting penumbra and core
areas, respectively. The code is available on

                              <span>This paper focusses on the optimal implementation of a Mean Variance
Estimation network (MVE network) (Nix and Weigend, 1994). This type of network
is often used as a building block for uncertainty estimation methods in a
regression setting, for instance Concrete dropout (Gal et al., 2017) and Deep
Ensembles (Lakshminarayanan et al., 2017). Specifically, an MVE network assumes
that the data is produced from a normal distribution with a mean function and
variance function. The MVE network outputs a mean and variance estimate and
optimizes the network parameters by minimizing the negative loglikelihood. In
our paper, we present two significant insights. Firstly, the convergence
difficulties reported in recent work can be relatively easily prevented by
following the simple yet often overlooked recommendation from the original
authors that a warm-up period should be used. During this period, only the mean
is optimized with a fixed variance. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this
step through experimentation, highlighting that it should be standard practice.
As a sidenote, we examine whether, after the warm-up, it is beneficial to fix
the mean while optimizing the variance or to optimize both simultaneously.
Here, we do not observe a substantial difference. Secondly, we introduce a
novel improvement of the MVE network: separate regularization of the mean and
the variance estimate. We demonstrate, both on toy examples and on a number of
benchmark UCI regression data sets, that following the original recommendations
and the novel separate regularization can lead to significant improvements.</span>

                              <span>Text-to-image diffusion models such as Stable Diffusion have recently
attracted the interest of many researchers, and inverting the diffusion process
can play an important role in better understanding the generative process and
how to engineer prompts in order to obtain the desired images. To this end, we
introduce the new task of predicting the text prompt given an image generated
by a generative diffusion model. We combine a series of white-box and black-box
models (with and without access to the weights of the diffusion network) to
deal with the proposed task. We propose a novel learning framework comprising
of a joint prompt regression and multi-label vocabulary classification
objective that generates improved prompts. To further improve our method, we
employ a curriculum learning procedure that promotes the learning of
image-prompt pairs with lower labeling noise (i.e. that are better aligned),
and an unsupervised domain-adaptive kernel learning method that uses the
similarities between samples in the source and target domains as extra
features. We conduct experiments on the DiffusionDB data set, predicting text
prompts from images generated by Stable Diffusion. Our novel learning framework
produces excellent results on the aforementioned task, yielding the highest
gains when applied on the white-box model. In addition, we make an interesting
discovery: training a diffusion model on the prompt generation task can make
the model generate images that are much better aligned with the input prompts,
when the model is directly reused for text-to-image generation.</span>

                              <span>Stochastic gradient descent (SGD) is the simplest deep learning optimizer
with which to train deep neural networks. While SGD can use various learning
rates, such as constant or diminishing rates, the previous numerical results
showed that SGD performs better than other deep learning optimizers using when
it uses learning rates given by line search methods. In this paper, we perform
a convergence analysis on SGD with a learning rate given by an Armijo line
search for nonconvex optimization. The analysis indicates that the upper bound
of the expectation of the squared norm of the full gradient becomes small when
the number of steps and the batch size are large. Next, we show that, for SGD
with the Armijo-line-search learning rate, the number of steps needed for
nonconvex optimization is a monotone decreasing convex function of the batch
size; that is, the number of steps needed for nonconvex optimization decreases
as the batch size increases. Furthermore, we show that the stochastic
first-order oracle (SFO) complexity, which is the stochastic gradient
computation cost, is a convex function of the batch size; that is, there exists
a critical batch size that minimizes the SFO complexity. Finally, we provide
numerical results that support our theoretical results. The numerical results
indicate that the number of steps needed for training deep neural networks
decreases as the batch size increases and that there exist the critical batch
sizes that can be estimated from the theoretical results.</span>

                              <span>Algorithms for solving the linear classification problem have a long history,
dating back at least to 1936 with linear discriminant analysis. For linearly
separable data, many algorithms can obtain the exact solution to the
corresponding 0-1 loss classification problem efficiently, but for data which
is not linearly separable, it has been shown that this problem, in full
generality, is NP-hard. Alternative approaches all involve approximations of
some kind, including the use of surrogates for the 0-1 loss (for example, the
hinge or logistic loss) or approximate combinatorial search, none of which can
be guaranteed to solve the problem exactly. Finding efficient algorithms to
obtain an exact i.e. globally optimal solution for the 0-1 loss linear
classification problem with fixed dimension, remains an open problem. In
research we report here, we detail the rigorous construction of a new
algorithm, incremental cell enumeration (ICE), that can solve the 0-1 loss
classification problem exactly in polynomial time. We prove correctness using
concepts from the theory of hyperplane arrangements and oriented matroids. We
demonstrate the effectiveness of this algorithm on synthetic and real-world
datasets, showing optimal accuracy both in and out-of-sample, in practical
computational time. We also empirically demonstrate how the use of approximate
upper bound leads to polynomial time run-time improvements to the algorithm
whilst retaining exactness. To our knowledge, this is the first,
rigorously-proven polynomial time, practical algorithm for this long-standing

                              <span>We introduce a novel interpretable tree based algorithm for prediction in a
regression setting. Our motivation is to estimate the unknown regression
function from a functional decomposition perspective in which the functional
components correspond to lower order interaction terms. The idea is to modify
the random forest algorithm by keeping certain leaves after they are split
instead of deleting them. This leads to non-binary trees which we refer to as
planted trees. An extension to a forest leads to our random planted forest
algorithm. Additionally, the maximum number of covariates which can interact
within a leaf can be bounded. If we set this interaction bound to one, the
resulting estimator is a sum of one-dimensional functions. In the other extreme
case, if we do not set a limit, the resulting estimator and corresponding model
place no restrictions on the form of the regression function. In a simulation
study we find encouraging prediction and visualisation properties of our random
planted forest method. We also develop theory for an idealized version of
random planted forests in cases where the interaction bound is low. We show
that if it is smaller than three, the idealized version achieves asymptotically
optimal convergence rates up to a logarithmic factor. Code is available on

                              <span>DNA methylation is a crucial regulator of gene transcription and has been
linked to various diseases, including autoimmune diseases and cancers. However,
diagnostics based on DNA methylation face challenges due to large feature sets
and small sample sizes, resulting in overfitting and suboptimal performance. To
address these issues, we propose MIRACLE, a novel interpretable neural network
that leverages autoencoder-based multi-task learning to integrate multiple
datasets and jointly identify common patterns in DNA methylation.

MIRACLE&#x27;s architecture reflects the relationships between methylation sites,
genes, and pathways, ensuring biological interpretability and meaningfulness.
The network comprises an encoder and a decoder, with a bottleneck layer
representing pathway information as the basic unit of heredity. Customized
defined MaskedLinear Layer is constrained by site-gene-pathway graph adjacency
matrix information, which provides explainability and expresses the
site-gene-pathway hierarchical structure explicitly. And from the embedding,
there are different multi-task classifiers to predict diseases.

Tested on six datasets, including rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus
erythematosus, multiple sclerosis, inflammatory bowel disease, psoriasis, and
type 1 diabetes, MIRACLE demonstrates robust performance in identifying common
functions of DNA methylation across different phenotypes, with higher accuracy
in prediction dieseases than baseline methods. By incorporating biological
prior knowledge, MIRACLE offers a meaningful and interpretable framework for
DNA methylation data analysis in the context of autoimmune diseases.</span>

applications utilizing graph structural data, such as social analysis and fraud
detection. The graph links, e.g., social relationships and transaction history,
are sensitive and valuable information, which raises privacy concerns when
using GNNs. To exploit these vulnerabilities, we propose VertexSerum, a novel
graph poisoning attack that increases the effectiveness of graph link stealing
by amplifying the link connectivity leakage. To infer node adjacency more
accurately, we propose an attention mechanism that can be embedded into the
link detection network. Our experiments demonstrate that VertexSerum
significantly outperforms the SOTA link inference attack, improving the AUC

different GNN structures. Furthermore, our experiments reveal the effectiveness
of VertexSerum in both black-box and online learning settings, further

pathway identification, but has not been explicitly utilized in the standard
random forest (RF) algorithm for gene expression data analysis. We investigate
the performance of a network-guided RF where the network information is
summarized into a sampling probability of predictor variables which is further
used in the construction of the RF. Our results suggest that network-guided RF
does not provide better disease prediction than the standard RF. In terms of
disease gene discovery, if disease genes form module(s), network-guided RF
identifies them more accurately. In addition, when disease status is
independent from genes in the given network, spurious gene selection results
can occur when using network information, especially on hub genes. Our
empirical analysis on two balanced microarray and RNA-Seq breast cancer
datasets from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) for classification of progesterone

                              <span>How to enable learnability for new classes while keeping the capability well
on old classes has been a crucial challenge for class incremental learning.
Beyond the normal case, long-tail class incremental learning and few-shot class
incremental learning are also proposed to consider the data imbalance and data
scarcity, respectively, which are common in real-world implementations and
further exacerbate the well-known problem of catastrophic forgetting. Existing
methods are specifically proposed for one of the three tasks. In this paper, we
offer a unified solution to the misalignment dilemma in the three tasks.
Concretely, we propose neural collapse terminus that is a fixed structure with
the maximal equiangular inter-class separation for the whole label space. It
serves as a consistent target throughout the incremental training to avoid
dividing the feature space incrementally. For CIL and LTCIL, we further propose
a prototype evolving scheme to drive the backbone features into our neural
collapse terminus smoothly. Our method also works for FSCIL with only minor
adaptations. Theoretical analysis indicates that our method holds the neural
collapse optimality in an incremental fashion regardless of data imbalance or
data scarcity. We also design a generalized case where we do not know the total
number of classes and whether the data distribution is normal, long-tail, or
few-shot for each coming session, to test the generalizability of our method.
Extensive experiments with multiple datasets are conducted to demonstrate the
effectiveness of our unified solution to all the three tasks and the
generalized case.</span>

                              <span>Multitask learning is a powerful framework that enables one to simultaneously
learn multiple related tasks by sharing information between them. Quantifying
uncertainty in the estimated tasks is of pivotal importance for many downstream
applications, such as online or active learning. In this work, we provide novel
multitask confidence intervals in the challenging agnostic setting, i.e., when
neither the similarity between tasks nor the tasks&#x27; features are available to
the learner. The obtained intervals do not require i.i.d. data and can be
directly applied to bound the regret in online learning. Through a refined
analysis of the multitask information gain, we obtain new regret guarantees
that, depending on a task similarity parameter, can significantly improve over
treating tasks independently. We further propose a novel online learning
algorithm that achieves such improved regret without knowing this parameter in
advance, i.e., automatically adapting to task similarity. As a second key
application of our results, we introduce a novel multitask active learning
setup where several tasks must be simultaneously optimized, but only one of
them can be queried for feedback by the learner at each round. For this
problem, we design a no-regret algorithm that uses our confidence intervals to
decide which task should be queried. Finally, we empirically validate our
bounds and algorithms on synthetic and real-world (drug discovery) data.</span>

                              <span>With the widespread application of personalized online services,
click-through rate (CTR) prediction has received more and more attention and
research. The most prominent features of CTR prediction are its multi-field
categorical data format, and vast and daily-growing data volume. The large
capacity of neural models helps digest such massive amounts of data under the
supervised learning paradigm, yet they fail to utilize the substantial data to
its full potential, since the 1-bit click signal is not sufficient to guide the
model to learn capable representations of features and instances. The
self-supervised learning paradigm provides a more promising pretrain-finetune
solution to better exploit the large amount of user click logs, and learn more
generalized and effective representations. However, self-supervised learning
for CTR prediction is still an open question, since current works on this line
are only preliminary and rudimentary. To this end, we propose a Model-agnostic
pretraining (MAP) framework that applies feature corruption and recovery on
multi-field categorical data, and more specifically, we derive two practical
algorithms: masked feature prediction (MFP) and replaced feature detection
(RFD). MFP digs into feature interactions within each instance through masking
and predicting a small portion of input features, and introduces noise
contrastive estimation (NCE) to handle large feature spaces. RFD further turns
MFP into a binary classification mode through replacing and detecting changes
in input features, making it even simpler and more effective for CTR
pretraining. Our extensive experiments on two real-world large-scale datasets
(i.e., Avazu, Criteo) demonstrate the advantages of these two methods on
several strong backbones (e.g., DCNv2, DeepFM), and achieve new
state-of-the-art performance in terms of both effectiveness and efficiency for

generation, yet they entail significant computational overhead, hindering the
technique&#x27;s broader application in the research community. We propose a
prior-based denoising training framework, the first to incorporate the
pre-train and fine-tune paradigm into the diffusion model training process,
which substantially improves training efficiency and shows potential in
facilitating various downstream tasks. Our approach centers on masking a high
proportion (e.g., up to 90\%) of the input image and employing masked denoising
score matching to denoise the visible areas, thereby guiding the diffusion
model to learn more salient features from training data as prior knowledge. By
utilizing masked learning in a pre-training stage, we efficiently train the
ViT-based diffusion model on CelebA-HQ $256 \times 256$ in the pixel space,
achieving a 4x acceleration and enhancing the quality of generated images
compared to denoising diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM). Moreover, our
masked pre-training technique can be universally applied to various diffusion
models that directly generate images in the pixel space, aiding in the learning
of pre-trained models with superior generalizability. For instance, a diffusion
model pre-trained on VGGFace2 attains a 46\% quality improvement through
fine-tuning with merely 10\% data from a different distribution. Moreover, our
method shows the potential to serve as a training paradigm for enhancing the
privacy protection capabilities of diffusion models. Our code is available at

                              <span>We consider the inverse acoustic obstacle problem for sound-soft star-shaped
obstacles in two dimensions wherein the boundary of the obstacle is determined
from measurements of the scattered field at a collection of receivers outside
the object. One of the standard approaches for solving this problem is to
reformulate it as an optimization problem: finding the boundary of the domain
that minimizes the $L^2$ distance between computed values of the scattered
field and the given measurement data. The optimization problem is
computationally challenging since the local set of convexity shrinks with
increasing frequency and results in an increasing number of local minima in the
vicinity of the true solution. In many practical experimental settings, low
frequency measurements are unavailable due to limitations of the experimental
setup or the sensors used for measurement. Thus, obtaining a good initial guess
for the optimization problem plays a vital role in this environment.

We present a neural network warm-start approach for solving the inverse
scattering problem, where an initial guess for the optimization problem is
obtained using a trained neural network. We demonstrate the effectiveness of
our method with several numerical examples. For high frequency problems, this
approach outperforms traditional iterative methods such as Gauss-Newton
initialized without any prior (i.e., initialized using a unit circle), or
initialized using the solution of a direct method such as the linear sampling
method. The algorithm remains robust to noise in the scattered field
measurements and also converges to the true solution for limited aperture data.
However, the number of training samples required to train the neural network
scales exponentially in frequency and the complexity of the obstacles
considered. We conclude with a discussion of this phenomenon and potential
directions for future research.</span>

                              <span>We present novel cross-sectional and longitudinal claim count models for
vehicle insurance built upon the Combined Actuarial Neural Network (CANN)
framework proposed by Mario W\&quot;uthrich and Michael Merz. The CANN approach
combines a classical actuarial model, such as a generalized linear model, with
a neural network. This blending of models results in a two-component model
comprising a classical regression model and a neural network part. The CANN
model leverages the strengths of both components, providing a solid foundation
and interpretability from the classical model while harnessing the flexibility
and capacity to capture intricate relationships and interactions offered by the
neural network. In our proposed models, we use well-known log-linear claim
count regression models for the classical regression part and a multilayer
perceptron (MLP) for the neural network part. The MLP part is used to process
telematics car driving data given as a vector characterizing the driving
behavior of each insured driver. In addition to the Poisson and negative
binomial distributions for cross-sectional data, we propose a procedure for
training our CANN model with a multivariate negative binomial (MVNB)
specification. By doing so, we introduce a longitudinal model that accounts for
the dependence between contracts from the same insured. Our results reveal that
the CANN models exhibit superior performance compared to log-linear models that
rely on manually engineered telematics features.</span>

only be distinguished from benign samples, but also classified into malware
families. For this purpose, investigating how existing malware families are
developed and examining emerging families need to be explored. This paper
focuses on the online processing of incoming malicious samples to assign them
to existing families or, in the case of samples from new families, to cluster
them. We experimented with seven prevalent malware families from the EMBER
dataset, four in the training set and three additional new families in the test
set. Based on the classification score of the multilayer perceptron, we
determined which samples would be classified and which would be clustered into
new malware families. We classified 97.21% of streaming data with a balanced
accuracy of 95.33%. Then, we clustered the remaining data using a
self-organizing map, achieving a purity from 47.61% for four clusters to 77.68%

be applied to the classification and clustering of zero-day malware into

                              <span>The turbulent jet ignition concept using prechambers is a promising solution
to achieve stable combustion at lean conditions in large gas engines, leading
to high efficiency at low emission levels. Due to the wide range of design and
operating parameters for large gas engine prechambers, the preferred method for
evaluating different designs is computational fluid dynamics (CFD), as testing
in test bed measurement campaigns is time-consuming and expensive. However, the
significant computational time required for detailed CFD simulations due to the
complexity of solving the underlying physics also limits its applicability. In
optimization settings similar to the present case, i.e., where the evaluation
of the objective function(s) is computationally costly, Bayesian optimization
has largely replaced classical design-of-experiment. Thus, the present study
deals with the computationally efficient Bayesian optimization of large gas
engine prechambers design using CFD simulation. Reynolds-averaged-Navier-Stokes
simulations are used to determine the target values as a function of the
selected prechamber design parameters. The results indicate that the chosen
strategy is effective to find a prechamber design that achieves the desired

                              <span>A self-driving vehicle (SDV) must be able to perceive its surroundings and
predict the future behavior of other traffic participants. Existing works
either perform object detection followed by trajectory forecasting of the
detected objects, or predict dense occupancy and flow grids for the whole
scene. The former poses a safety concern as the number of detections needs to
be kept low for efficiency reasons, sacrificing object recall. The latter is
computationally expensive due to the high-dimensionality of the output grid,
and suffers from the limited receptive field inherent to fully convolutional
networks. Furthermore, both approaches employ many computational resources
predicting areas or objects that might never be queried by the motion planner.
This motivates our unified approach to perception and future prediction that
implicitly represents occupancy and flow over time with a single neural
network. Our method avoids unnecessary computation, as it can be directly
queried by the motion planner at continuous spatio-temporal locations.
Moreover, we design an architecture that overcomes the limited receptive field
of previous explicit occupancy prediction methods by adding an efficient yet
effective global attention mechanism. Through extensive experiments in both
urban and highway settings, we demonstrate that our implicit model outperforms
the current state-of-the-art. For more information, visit the project website:

                              <span>With the rise of the popularity and usage of neural networks, trustworthy
uncertainty estimation is becoming increasingly essential. One of the most
prominent uncertainty estimation methods is Deep Ensembles (Lakshminarayanan et
al., 2017) . A classical parametric model has uncertainty in the parameters due
to the fact that the data on which the model is build is a random sample. A
modern neural network has an additional uncertainty component since the
optimization of the network is random. Lakshminarayanan et al. (2017) noted
that Deep Ensembles do not incorporate the classical uncertainty induced by the
effect of finite data. In this paper, we present a computationally cheap
extension of Deep Ensembles for the regression setting, called Bootstrapped
Deep Ensembles, that explicitly takes this classical effect of finite data into
account using a modified version of the parametric bootstrap. We demonstrate
through an experimental study that our method significantly improves upon
standard Deep Ensembles</span>

Tumor Dynamic Neural-ODE (TDNODE) as a pharmacology-informed neural network to

overcomes a key limitation of existing models in its ability to make unbiased

to express an underlying dynamical law which possesses the fundamental property
of generalized homogeneity with respect to time. Thus, the modeling formalism
enables the encoder output to be interpreted as kinetic rate metrics, with
inverse time as the physical unit. We show that the generated metrics can be
used to predict patients&#x27; overall survival (OS) with high accuracy. The

                              <span>Cross-modal representation learning learns a shared embedding between two or
more modalities to improve performance in a given task compared to using only
one of the modalities. Cross-modal representation learning from different data
types -- such as images and time-series data (e.g., audio or text data) --
requires a deep metric learning loss that minimizes the distance between the
modality embeddings. In this paper, we propose to use the contrastive or
triplet loss, which uses positive and negative identities to create sample
pairs with different labels, for cross-modal representation learning between
image and time-series modalities (CMR-IS). By adapting the triplet loss for
cross-modal representation learning, higher accuracy in the main (time-series
classification) task can be achieved by exploiting additional information of
the auxiliary (image classification) task. We present a triplet loss with a
dynamic margin for single label and sequence-to-sequence classification tasks.
We perform extensive evaluations on synthetic image and time-series data, and
on data for offline handwriting recognition (HWR) and on online HWR from
sensor-enhanced pens for classifying written words. Our experiments show an
improved classification accuracy, faster convergence, and better
generalizability due to an improved cross-modal representation. Furthermore,
the more suitable generalizability leads to a better adaptability between

the highly familiar softmax classification model, to which it relates similarly
to how variational and traditional autoencoders relate. We derive a training
objective based on the evidence lower bound (ELBO) that is non-trivial to
optimize, and therefore propose an adversarial approach to maximise it. We show
that VC addresses an inherent inconsistency within softmax classification,
whilst also allowing more flexible choices of prior distributions in the latent
space in place of implicit assumptions revealed within off-the-shelf softmax
classifiers. Empirical evaluation on image and text classification datasets
demonstrates that variational classification maintains prediction accuracy
while improving other desirable properties such as calibration and adversarial

                              <span>In recent years, Variational Quantum Algorithms (VQAs) have emerged as a
promising approach for solving optimization problems on quantum computers in
the NISQ era. However, one limitation of VQAs is their reliance on
fixed-structure circuits, which may not be taylored for specific problems or
hardware configurations. A leading strategy to address this issue are
Adaptative VQAs, which dynamically modify the circuit structure by adding and
removing gates, and optimize their parameters during the training. Several
Adaptative VQAs, based on heuristics such as circuit shallowness, entanglement
capability and hardware compatibility, have already been proposed in the
literature, but there is still lack of a systematic comparison between the
different methods. In this paper, we aim to fill this gap by analyzing three
Adaptative VQAs: Evolutionary Variational Quantum Eigensolver (EVQE), Variable
Ansatz (VAns), already proposed in the literature, and Random Adapt-VQE
(RA-VQE), a random approach we introduce as a baseline. In order to compare
these algorithms to traditional VQAs, we also include the Quantum Approximate
Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) in our analysis. We apply these algorithms to
QUBO problems and study their performance by examining the quality of the
solutions found and the computational times required. Additionally, we
investigate how the choice of the hyperparameters can impact the overall
performance of the algorithms, highlighting the importance of selecting an
appropriate methodology for hyperparameter tuning. Our analysis sets benchmarks
for Adaptative VQAs designed for near-term quantum devices and provides
valuable insights to guide future research in this area.</span>

                              <span>For safety-related applications, it is crucial to produce trustworthy deep
neural networks whose prediction is associated with confidence that can
represent the likelihood of correctness for subsequent decision-making.
Existing dense binary classification models are prone to being over-confident.
To improve model calibration, we propose Adaptive Stochastic Label Perturbation
(ASLP) which learns a unique label perturbation level for each training image.
ASLP employs our proposed Self-Calibrating Binary Cross Entropy (SC-BCE) loss,
which unifies label perturbation processes including stochastic approaches
(like DisturbLabel), and label smoothing, to correct calibration while
maintaining classification rates. ASLP follows Maximum Entropy Inference of
classic statistical mechanics to maximise prediction entropy with respect to
missing information. It performs this while: (1) preserving classification
accuracy on known data as a conservative solution, or (2) specifically improves
model calibration degree by minimising the gap between the prediction accuracy
and expected confidence of the target training label. Extensive results
demonstrate that ASLP can significantly improve calibration degrees of dense
binary classification models on both in-distribution and out-of-distribution
data. The code is available on https://github.com/Carlisle-Liu/ASLP.</span>

exposed inherent risks, highlighting their dual nature and raising concerns

To bridge this gap, This paper investigates both the long-standing and emerging

extensive map outlining the trustworthiness of these models, while also
providing practical recommendations and identifying future directions. These

                              <span>We deal with a general distributed constrained online learning problem with
privacy over time-varying networks, where a class of nondecomposable objectives
are considered. Under this setting, each node only controls a part of the
global decision, and the goal of all nodes is to collaboratively minimize the
global cost over a time horizon $T$ while guarantees the security of the
transmitted information. For such problems, we first design a novel generic
algorithm framework, named as DPSDA, of differentially private distributed
online learning using the Laplace mechanism and the stochastic variants of dual
averaging method. Note that in the dual updates, all nodes of DPSDA employ the
noise-corrupted gradients for more generality. Then, we propose two algorithms,
named as DPSDA-C and DPSDA-PS, under this framework. In DPSDA-C, the nodes
implement a circulation-based communication in the primal updates so as to
alleviate the disagreements over time-varying undirected networks. In addition,
for the extension to time-varying directed ones, the nodes implement the
broadcast-based push-sum dynamics in DPSDA-PS, which can achieve average
consensus over arbitrary directed networks. Theoretical results show that both
algorithms attain an expected regret upper bound in $\mathcal{O}( \sqrt{T} )$
when the objective function is convex, which matches the best utility
achievable by cutting-edge algorithms. Finally, numerical experiment results on
both synthetic and real-world datasets verify the effectiveness of our
algorithms.</span>

                              <span>Simulating turbulence is critical for many societally important applications
in aerospace engineering, environmental science, the energy industry, and
biomedicine. Large eddy simulation (LES) has been widely used as an alternative
to direct numerical simulation (DNS) for simulating turbulent flows due to its
reduced computational cost. However, LES is unable to capture all of the scales
of turbulent transport accurately. Reconstructing DNS from low-resolution LES
is critical for many scientific and engineering disciplines, but it poses many
challenges to existing super-resolution methods due to the spatio-temporal
complexity of turbulent flows. In this work, we propose a new physics-guided
neural network for reconstructing the sequential DNS from low-resolution LES
data. The proposed method leverages the partial differential equation that
underlies the flow dynamics in the design of spatio-temporal model
architecture. A degradation-based refinement method is also developed to
enforce physical constraints and further reduce the accumulated reconstruction
errors over long periods. The results on two different types of turbulent flow
data confirm the superiority of the proposed method in reconstructing the
high-resolution DNS data and preserving the physical characteristics of flow
transport.</span>

this work proposes gradient boosting machine learning methods accompanied by

on the XGBoost, LightGBM, and CatBoost implementations. This work also studies
the effect of dataset size on classifier performance. A three-class

Fanaroff-Riley classes: class 0, class I, and class II, using radio sources
from the Best-Heckman sample. All three proposed gradient boosting methods
outperformed a state-of-the-art convolutional neural networks-based classifier

be divided into two highly correlated categories according to whether the
temporal data is calibrated, ie, multivariate time series causal discovery, and
event sequence causal discovery. However, most previous surveys are only

                              <span>While deep learning gradually penetrates operational planning, its inherent
prediction errors may significantly affect electricity prices. This letter
examines how prediction errors propagate into electricity prices, revealing
notable pricing errors and their spatial disparity in congested power systems.
To improve fairness, we propose to embed electricity market-clearing
optimization as a deep learning layer. Differentiating through this layer
allows for balancing between prediction and pricing errors, as oppose to
minimizing prediction errors alone. This layer implicitly optimizes fairness
and controls the spatial distribution of price errors across the system. We
showcase the price-aware deep learning in the nexus of wind power forecasting
and short-term electricity market clearing.</span>

                              <span>Albeit being a prevalent architecture searching approach, differentiable
architecture search (DARTS) is largely hindered by its substantial memory cost
since the entire supernet resides in the memory. This is where the single-path
DARTS comes in, which only chooses a single-path submodel at each step. While
being memory-friendly, it also comes with low computational costs. Nonetheless,
we discover a critical issue of single-path DARTS that has not been primarily
noticed. Namely, it also suffers from severe performance collapse since too
many parameter-free operations like skip connections are derived, just like
DARTS does. In this paper, we propose a new algorithm called RObustifying
Memory-Efficient NAS (ROME) to give a cure. First, we disentangle the topology
search from the operation search to make searching and evaluation consistent.
We then adopt Gumbel-Top2 reparameterization and gradient accumulation to
robustify the unwieldy bi-level optimization. We verify ROME extensively across
15 benchmarks to demonstrate its effectiveness and robustness.</span>

algorithm. We analyze its stability to perturbations of the input data using
the correspondence-interleaving distance, a metric for hierarchical clusterings
that we introduce. Taking certain one-parameter slices of degree-Rips recovers
well-known methods for density-based clustering, but we show that these methods
are unstable. However, we prove that degree-Rips, as a multiparameter object,
is stable, and we propose an alternative approach for taking slices of

using the correspondence-interleaving distance. We provide an algorithm for
extracting a single clustering from one-parameter hierarchical clusterings,
which is stable with respect to the correspondence-interleaving distance. And,
we integrate these methods into a pipeline for density-based clustering, which

systems are playing an important role on assisting human decision making. The
satisfaction of users and the interests of platforms are closely related to the
quality of the generated recommendation results. However, as a highly
data-driven system, recommender system could be affected by data or algorithmic
bias and thus generate unfair results, which could weaken the reliance of the
systems. As a result, it is crucial to address the potential unfairness
problems in recommendation settings. Recently, there has been growing attention
on fairness considerations in recommender systems with more and more literature
on approaches to promote fairness in recommendation. However, the studies are
rather fragmented and lack a systematic organization, thus making it difficult
to penetrate for new researchers to the domain. This motivates us to provide a
systematic survey of existing works on fairness in recommendation. This survey
focuses on the foundations for fairness in recommendation literature. It first
presents a brief introduction about fairness in basic machine learning tasks
such as classification and ranking in order to provide a general overview of
fairness research, as well as introduce the more complex situations and
challenges that need to be considered when studying fairness in recommender
systems. After that, the survey will introduce fairness in recommendation with
a focus on the taxonomies of current fairness definitions, the typical
techniques for improving fairness, as well as the datasets for fairness studies
in recommendation. The survey also talks about the challenges and opportunities
in fairness research with the hope of promoting the fair recommendation

                              <span>Recently, significant advancements have been made in time-series forecasting
research, with an increasing focus on analyzing the nature of time-series data,
e.g, channel-independence (CI) and channel-dependence (CD), rather than solely
focusing on designing sophisticated forecasting models. However, current
research has primarily focused on either CI or CD in isolation, and the
challenge of effectively combining these two opposing properties to achieve a
synergistic effect remains an unresolved issue. In this paper, we carefully
examine the opposing properties of CI and CD, and raise a practical question
that has not been effectively answered, e.g.,&quot;How to effectively mix the CI and
CD properties of time series to achieve better predictive performance?&quot; To
answer this question, we propose Mlinear (MIX-Linear), a simple yet effective
method based mainly on linear layers. The design philosophy of Mlinear mainly
includes two aspects:(1) dynamically tuning the CI and CD properties based on
the time semantics of different input time series, and (2) providing deep
supervision to adjust the individual performance of the &quot;CI predictor&quot; and &quot;CD
predictor&quot;. In addition, empirically, we introduce a new loss function that
significantly outperforms the widely used mean squared error (MSE) on multiple
datasets. Experiments on time-series datasets covering multiple fields and
widely used have demonstrated the superiority of our method over PatchTST which
is the lateset Transformer-based method in terms of the MSE and MAE metrics on
7 datasets with identical sequence inputs (336 or 512). Specifically, our
method significantly outperforms PatchTST with a ratio of 21:3 at 336 sequence
length input and 29:10 at 512 sequence length input. Additionally, our approach
has a 10 $\times$ efficiency advantage at the unit level, taking into account
both training and inference times.</span>

directly communicate with the central server, the users&#x27; devices have limited
computation and battery powers, and the serving base station (BS) has a fixed
bandwidth. Owing to these practical constraints and system models, this paper
leverages model pruning and proposes a pruning-enabled hierarchical federated
learning (PHFL) in heterogeneous networks (HetNets). We first derive an upper
bound of the convergence rate that clearly demonstrates the impact of the model
pruning and wireless communications between the clients and the associated BS.
Then we jointly optimize the model pruning ratio, central processing unit (CPU)
frequency and transmission power of the clients in order to minimize the
controllable terms of the convergence bound under strict delay and energy
constraints. However, since the original problem is not convex, we perform
successive convex approximation (SCA) and jointly optimize the parameters for
the relaxed convex problem. Through extensive simulation, we validate the
effectiveness of our proposed PHFL algorithm in terms of test accuracy, wall

tasks with little to no labeled data. Despite their versatile abilities, the
larger question of their ability to reason remains ill-understood. This paper
addresses reasoning in math word problems (MWPs) by studying symbolic versions
of the numeric problems, since a symbolic expression is a &quot;concise explanation&quot;
of the numeric answer. We create and use a symbolic version of the SVAMP
dataset and find that GPT-3&#x27;s davinci-002 model also has good zero-shot
accuracy on symbolic MWPs. To evaluate the faithfulness of the model&#x27;s
reasoning, we go beyond accuracy and additionally evaluate the alignment
between the final answer and the outputted reasoning, which correspond to
numeric and symbolic answers respectively for MWPs. We explore a self-prompting
approach to encourage the symbolic reasoning to align with the numeric answer,
thus equipping the LLM with the ability to provide a concise and verifiable
reasoning and making it more interpretable. Surprisingly, self-prompting also
improves the symbolic accuracy to be higher than both the numeric and symbolic
accuracies, thus providing an ensembling effect. The SVAMP_Sym dataset will be
released for future research on symbolic math problems.</span>

                              <span>Adversarial training (AT) is widely considered the state-of-the-art technique
for improving the robustness of deep neural networks (DNNs) against adversarial
examples (AE). Nevertheless, recent studies have revealed that adversarially
trained models are prone to unfairness problems, restricting their
applicability. In this paper, we empirically observe that this limitation may
be attributed to serious adversarial confidence overfitting, i.e., certain
adversarial examples with overconfidence. To alleviate this problem, we propose
HAM, a straightforward yet effective framework via adaptive Hard Adversarial
example Mining.HAM concentrates on mining hard adversarial examples while
discarding the easy ones in an adaptive fashion. Specifically, HAM identifies
hard AEs in terms of their step sizes needed to cross the decision boundary
when calculating loss value. Besides, an early-dropping mechanism is
incorporated to discard the easy examples at the initial stages of AE
generation, resulting in efficient AT. Extensive experimental results on
CIFAR-10, SVHN, and Imagenette demonstrate that HAM achieves significant
improvement in robust fairness while reducing computational cost compared to
several state-of-the-art adversarial training methods. The code will be made

                              <span>ChatGPT-like models have revolutionized various applications in artificial
intelligence, from summarization and coding to translation, matching or even
surpassing human performance. However, the current landscape lacks an
accessible, efficient, and cost-effective end-to-end RLHF (Reinforcement
Learning with Human Feedback) training pipeline for these powerful models,
particularly when training at the scale of billions of parameters. This paper
introduces DeepSpeed-Chat, a novel system that democratizes RLHF training,
making it accessible to the AI community. DeepSpeed-Chat offers three key
capabilities: an easy-to-use training and inference experience for ChatGPT-like
models, a DeepSpeed-RLHF pipeline that replicates the training pipeline from
InstructGPT, and a robust DeepSpeed-RLHF system that combines various
optimizations for training and inference in a unified way. The system delivers
unparalleled efficiency and scalability, enabling training of models with
hundreds of billions of parameters in record time and at a fraction of the
cost. With this development, DeepSpeed-Chat paves the way for broader access to
advanced RLHF training, even for data scientists with limited resources,
thereby fostering innovation and further development in the field of AI.</span>

                              <span>This study investigated the potential of end-to-end deep learning tools as a
more effective substitute for FEM in predicting stress-strain fields within 2D
cross sections of arterial wall. We first proposed a U-Net based fully
convolutional neural network (CNN) to predict the von Mises stress and strain
distribution based on the spatial arrangement of calcification within arterial
wall cross-sections. Further, we developed a conditional generative adversarial
network (cGAN) to enhance, particularly from the perceptual perspective, the
prediction accuracy of stress and strain field maps for arterial walls with
various calcification quantities and spatial configurations. On top of U-Net
and cGAN, we also proposed their ensemble approaches, respectively, to further
improve the prediction accuracy of field maps. Our dataset, consisting of input
and output images, was generated by implementing boundary conditions and
extracting stress-strain field maps. The trained U-Net models can accurately
predict von Mises stress and strain fields, with structural similarity index
scores (SSIM) of 0.854 and 0.830 and mean squared errors of 0.017 and 0.018 for
stress and strain, respectively, on a reserved test set. Meanwhile, the cGAN
models in a combination of ensemble and transfer learning techniques
demonstrate high accuracy in predicting von Mises stress and strain fields, as
evidenced by SSIM scores of 0.890 for stress and 0.803 for strain.
Additionally, mean squared errors of 0.008 for stress and 0.017 for strain
further support the model&#x27;s performance on a designated test set. Overall, this
study developed a surrogate model for finite element analysis, which can
accurately and efficiently predict stress-strain fields of arterial walls
regardless of complex geometries and boundary conditions.</span>

                              <span>In peer review systems, reviewers are often asked to evaluate various
features of submissions, such as technical quality or novelty. A score is given
to each of the predefined features and based on these the reviewer has to
provide an overall quantitative recommendation. It may be assumed that each
reviewer has her own mapping from the set of features to a recommendation, and
that different reviewers have different mappings in mind. This introduces an
element of arbitrariness known as commensuration bias. In this paper we discuss
a framework, introduced by Noothigattu, Shah and Procaccia, and then applied by
the organizers of the AAAI 2022 conference. Noothigattu, Shah and Procaccia
proposed to aggregate reviewer&#x27;s mapping by minimizing certain loss functions,
and studied axiomatic properties of this approach, in the sense of social
choice theory. We challenge several of the results and assumptions used in
their work and report a number of negative results. On the one hand, we study a
trade-off between some of the axioms proposed and the ability of the method to
properly capture agreements of the majority of reviewers. On the other hand, we
show that dropping a certain unrealistic assumption has dramatic effects,

generalization of deep neural networks (DNNs). In this study, we introduce and
theoretically demonstrate a simple feature noise method, which directly adds
noise to the features of training data, can enhance the generalization of DNNs
under label noise. Specifically, we conduct theoretical analyses to reveal that
label noise leads to weakened DNN generalization by loosening the PAC-Bayes
generalization bound, and feature noise results in better DNN generalization by
imposing an upper bound on the mutual information between the model weights and
the features, which constrains the PAC-Bayes generalization bound. Furthermore,
to ensure effective generalization of DNNs in the presence of label noise, we
conduct application analyses to identify the optimal types and levels of
feature noise to add for obtaining desirable label noise generalization.
Finally, extensive experimental results on several popular datasets demonstrate
the feature noise method can significantly enhance the label noise

                              <span>Diffusion models have shown promising results in cross-modal generation
tasks, including text-to-image and text-to-audio generation. However,
generating music, as a special type of audio, presents unique challenges due to
limited availability of music data and sensitive issues related to copyright
and plagiarism. In this paper, to tackle these challenges, we first construct a
state-of-the-art text-to-music model, MusicLDM, that adapts Stable Diffusion
and AudioLDM architectures to the music domain. We achieve this by retraining
the contrastive language-audio pretraining model (CLAP) and the Hifi-GAN
vocoder, as components of MusicLDM, on a collection of music data samples.
Then, to address the limitations of training data and to avoid plagiarism, we
leverage a beat tracking model and propose two different mixup strategies for
data augmentation: beat-synchronous audio mixup and beat-synchronous latent
mixup, which recombine training audio directly or via a latent embeddings
space, respectively. Such mixup strategies encourage the model to interpolate
between musical training samples and generate new music within the convex hull
of the training data, making the generated music more diverse while still
staying faithful to the corresponding style. In addition to popular evaluation
metrics, we design several new evaluation metrics based on CLAP score to
demonstrate that our proposed MusicLDM and beat-synchronous mixup strategies
improve both the quality and novelty of generated music, as well as the
correspondence between input text and generated music.</span>

clustered together in the projected space. However, popular algorithms for

                              <span>Depth completion, which aims to generate high-quality dense depth maps from
sparse depth maps, has attracted increasing attention in recent years. Previous
work usually employs RGB images as guidance, and introduces iterative spatial
propagation to refine estimated coarse depth maps. However, most of the
propagation refinement methods require several iterations and suffer from a
fixed receptive field, which may contain irrelevant and useless information
with very sparse input. In this paper, we address these two challenges
simultaneously by revisiting the idea of deformable convolution. We propose an
effective architecture that leverages deformable kernel convolution as a
single-pass refinement module, and empirically demonstrate its superiority. To
better understand the function of deformable convolution and exploit it for
depth completion, we further systematically investigate a variety of
representative strategies. Our study reveals that, different from prior work,
deformable convolution needs to be applied on an estimated depth map with a
relatively high density for better performance. We evaluate our model on the
large-scale KITTI dataset and achieve state-of-the-art level performance in
both accuracy and inference speed. Our code is available at

                              <span>Learning with Noisy Labels (LNL) has become an appealing topic, as
imperfectly annotated data are relatively cheaper to obtain. Recent
state-of-the-art approaches employ specific selection mechanisms to separate
clean and noisy samples and then apply Semi-Supervised Learning (SSL)
techniques for improved performance. However, the selection step mostly
provides a medium-sized and decent-enough clean subset, which overlooks a rich
set of clean samples. To fulfill this, we propose a novel LNL framework ProMix
that attempts to maximize the utility of clean samples for boosted performance.
Key to our method, we propose a matched high confidence selection technique
that selects those examples with high confidence scores and matched predictions
with given labels to dynamically expand a base clean sample set. To overcome
the potential side effect of excessive clean set selection procedure, we
further devise a novel SSL framework that is able to train balanced and
unbiased classifiers on the separated clean and noisy samples. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that ProMix significantly advances the current
state-of-the-art results on multiple benchmarks with different types and levels
of noise. It achieves an average improvement of 2.48\% on the CIFAR-N dataset.

                              <span>Graph Machine Learning (GML) has numerous applications, such as node/graph
classification and link prediction, in real-world domains. Providing
human-understandable explanations for GML models is a challenging yet
fundamental task to foster their adoption, but validating explanations for link
prediction models has received little attention. In this paper, we provide
quantitative metrics to assess the quality of link prediction explanations,
with or without ground-truth. State-of-the-art explainability methods for Graph
Neural Networks are evaluated using these metrics. We discuss how underlying
assumptions and technical details specific to the link prediction task, such as
the choice of distance between node embeddings, can influence the quality of

                              <span>Text-to-image generative models can produce photo-realistic images for an
extremely broad range of concepts, and their usage has proliferated widely
among the general public. On the flip side, these models have numerous
drawbacks, including their potential to generate images featuring sexually
explicit content, mirror artistic styles without permission, or even
hallucinate (or deepfake) the likenesses of celebrities. Consequently, various
methods have been proposed in order to &quot;erase&quot; sensitive concepts from
text-to-image models. In this work, we examine five recently proposed concept
erasure methods, and show that targeted concepts are not fully excised from any
of these methods. Specifically, we leverage the existence of special learned
word embeddings that can retrieve &quot;erased&quot; concepts from the sanitized models
with no alterations to their weights. Our results highlight the brittleness of
post hoc concept erasure methods, and call into question their use in the
algorithmic toolkit for AI safety.</span>

Applications of this technology include: search, information retrieval and

restricted to a particular structure to complete online queries quickly. This
paper addresses the optimization of these large scale decision systems given an
arbitrary reward function. We cast this learning problem in a policy

By combining Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC) and
encoder-decoder-based automatic speech recognition models, we generate rich

processing methods to extract features from these transcripts to produce
prototypes of healthy speech. Basic distance measures from these prototypes
serve as input features for standard machine learning classifiers, yielding
human-level accuracy for the distinction between recordings of people with

                              <span>Graph and hypergraph representation learning has attracted increasing
attention from various research fields. Despite the decent performance and
fruitful applications of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), Hypergraph Neural
Networks (HGNNs), and their well-designed variants, on some commonly used
benchmark graphs and hypergraphs, they are outperformed by even a simple
Multi-Layer Perceptron. This observation motivates a reexamination of the
design paradigm of the current GNNs and HGNNs and poses challenges of
extracting graph features effectively. In this work, a universal feature
encoder for both graph and hypergraph representation learning is designed,
called UniG-Encoder. The architecture starts with a forward transformation of
the topological relationships of connected nodes into edge or hyperedge
features via a normalized projection matrix. The resulting edge/hyperedge
features, together with the original node features, are fed into a neural
network. The encoded node embeddings are then derived from the reversed
transformation, described by the transpose of the projection matrix, of the
network&#x27;s output, which can be further used for tasks such as node
classification. The proposed architecture, in contrast to the traditional
spectral-based and/or message passing approaches, simultaneously and
comprehensively exploits the node features and graph/hypergraph topologies in
an efficient and unified manner, covering both heterophilic and homophilic
graphs. The designed projection matrix, encoding the graph features, is
intuitive and interpretable. Extensive experiments are conducted and
demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed framework on twelve
representative hypergraph datasets and six real-world graph datasets, compared
to the state-of-the-art methods. Our implementation is available online at
https://github.com/MinhZou/UniG-Encoder.</span>

                              <span>Visual Question Answering (VQA) based on multi-modal data facilitates
real-life applications such as home robots and medical diagnoses. One
significant challenge is to devise a robust decentralized learning framework
for various client models where centralized data collection is refrained due to
confidentiality concerns. This work aims to tackle privacy-preserving VQA by
decoupling a multi-modal model into representation modules and a contrastive
module and leveraging inter-module gradients sharing and inter-client weight
sharing. To this end, we propose Bidirectional Contrastive Split Learning
(BiCSL) to train a global multi-modal model on the entire data distribution of
decentralized clients. We employ the contrastive loss that enables a more
efficient self-supervised learning of decentralized modules. Comprehensive
experiments are conducted on the VQA-v2 dataset based on five SOTA VQA models,
demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed method. Furthermore, we inspect
BiCSL&#x27;s robustness against a dual-key backdoor attack on VQA. Consequently,
BiCSL shows much better robustness to the multi-modal adversarial attack
compared to the centralized learning method, which provides a promising
approach to decentralized multi-modal learning.</span>

As upscaling requires inventing features that might not be present at lower

a neural network architecture that is capable of not only learning upscaling

human-level intelligence to physically interact with the environment, while
only requiring low-cost camera sensors. However, current vision-based
teleoperation systems are designed and engineered towards a particular robot
model and deploy environment, which scales poorly as the pool of the robot
models expands and the variety of the operating environment increases. In this
paper, we propose AnyTeleop, a unified and general teleoperation system to
support multiple different arms, hands, realities, and camera configurations
within a single system. Although being designed to provide great flexibility to
the choice of simulators and real hardware, our system can still achieve great
performance. For real-world experiments, AnyTeleop can outperform a previous
system that was designed for a specific robot hardware with a higher success
rate, using the same robot. For teleoperation in simulation, AnyTeleop leads to
better imitation learning performance, compared with a previous system that is
particularly designed for that simulator. Project page: this http URL</span>

                              <span>Distribution shifts are a serious concern in modern statistical learning as
they can systematically change the properties of the data away from the truth.
We focus on Wasserstein distribution shifts, where every data point may undergo
a slight perturbation, as opposed to the Huber contamination model where a
fraction of observations are outliers. We formulate and study shifts beyond
independent perturbations, exploring Joint Distribution Shifts, where the
per-observation perturbations can be coordinated. We analyze several important
statistical problems, including location estimation, linear regression, and
non-parametric density estimation. Under a squared loss for mean estimation and
prediction error in linear regression, we find the exact minimax risk, a least
favorable perturbation, and show that the sample mean and least squares
estimators are respectively optimal. This holds for both independent and joint
shifts, but the least favorable perturbations and minimax risks differ. For
other problems, we provide nearly optimal estimators and precise finite-sample
bounds. We also introduce several tools for bounding the minimax risk under
distribution shift, such as a smoothing technique for location families, and
generalizations of classical tools including least favorable sequences of
priors, the modulus of continuity, Le Cam&#x27;s, Fano&#x27;s, and Assouad&#x27;s methods.</span>

                              <span>Recent studies have shown that deep neural networks (DNNs) are vulnerable to
adversarial attacks, including evasion and backdoor (poisoning) attacks. On the
defense side, there have been intensive efforts on improving both empirical and
provable robustness against evasion attacks; however, the provable robustness
against backdoor attacks still remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we
focus on certifying the machine learning model robustness against general
threat models, especially backdoor attacks. We first provide a unified
framework via randomized smoothing techniques and show how it can be
instantiated to certify the robustness against both evasion and backdoor
attacks. We then propose the first robust training process, RAB, to smooth the
trained model and certify its robustness against backdoor attacks. We prove the
robustness bound for machine learning models trained with RAB and prove that
our robustness bound is tight. In addition, we theoretically show that it is
possible to train the robust smoothed models efficiently for simple models such
as K-nearest neighbor classifiers, and we propose an exact smooth-training
algorithm that eliminates the need to sample from a noise distribution for such
models. Empirically, we conduct comprehensive experiments for different machine
learning (ML) models such as DNNs, support vector machines, and K-NN models on
MNIST, CIFAR-10, and ImageNette datasets and provide the first benchmark for
certified robustness against backdoor attacks. In addition, we evaluate K-NN
models on a spambase tabular dataset to demonstrate the advantages of the
proposed exact algorithm. Both the theoretic analysis and the comprehensive
evaluation on diverse ML models and datasets shed light on further robust
learning strategies against general training time attacks.</span>

                              <span>In recent years, multiple notions of algorithmic fairness have arisen. One
such notion is individual fairness (IF), which requires that individuals who
are similar receive similar treatment. In parallel, matrix estimation (ME) has
emerged as a natural paradigm for handling noisy data with missing values. In
this work, we connect the two concepts. We show that pre-processing data using
ME can improve an algorithm&#x27;s IF without sacrificing performance. Specifically,
we show that using a popular ME method known as singular value thresholding
(SVT) to pre-process the data provides a strong IF guarantee under appropriate
conditions. We then show that, under analogous conditions, SVT pre-processing
also yields estimates that are consistent and approximately minimax optimal. As
such, the ME pre-processing step does not, under the stated conditions,
increase the prediction error of the base algorithm, i.e., does not impose a
fairness-performance trade-off. We verify these results on synthetic and real
data.</span>

                              <span>Preprints play an increasingly critical role in academic communities. There
are many reasons driving researchers to post their manuscripts to preprint
servers before formal submission to journals or conferences, but the use of
preprints has also sparked considerable controversy, especially surrounding the
claim of priority. In this paper, a case study of computer science preprints
submitted to arXiv from 2008 to 2017 is conducted to quantify how many
preprints have eventually been printed in peer-reviewed venues. Among those
published manuscripts, some are published under different titles and without an
update to their preprints on arXiv. In the case of these manuscripts, the
traditional fuzzy matching method is incapable of mapping the preprint to the
final published version. In view of this issue, we introduce a semantics-based
mapping method with the employment of Bidirectional Encoder Representations
from Transformers (BERT). With this new mapping method and a plurality of data
sources, we find that 66% of all sampled preprints are published under
unchanged titles and 11% are published under different titles and with other
modifications. A further analysis was then performed to investigate why these
preprints but not others were accepted for publication. Our comparison reveals
that in the field of computer science, published preprints feature adequate
revisions, multiple authorship, detailed abstract and introduction, extensive
and authoritative references and available source code.</span>

those goals: episodic control and successor features. Episodic control is a
cognitively inspired approach relying on episodic memory, an instance-based
memory model of an agent&#x27;s experiences. Meanwhile, successor features and
generalized policy improvement (SF&amp;GPI) is a meta and transfer learning
framework allowing to learn policies for tasks that can be efficiently reused
for later tasks which have a different reward function. Individually, these two
techniques have shown impressive results in vastly improving sample efficiency
and the elegant reuse of previously learned policies. Thus, we outline a
combination of both approaches in a single reinforcement learning framework and
empirically illustrate its benefits.</span>

hydrological modelling applications, yet the spatial coverage with rain gauge
stations is limited due to economic constraints. Gridded satellite
precipitation datasets offer an alternative option for estimating the actual
precipitation by covering uniformly large areas, albeit related estimates are
not accurate. To improve precipitation estimates, machine learning is applied
to merge rain gauge-based measurements and gridded satellite precipitation
products. In this context, observed precipitation plays the role of the
dependent variable, while satellite data play the role of predictor variables.
Random forests is the dominant machine learning algorithm in relevant
applications. In those spatial predictions settings, point predictions (mostly
the mean or the median of the conditional distribution) of the dependent
variable are issued. The aim of the manuscript is to solve the problem of
probabilistic prediction of precipitation with an emphasis on extreme quantiles
in spatial interpolation settings. Here we propose, issuing probabilistic
spatial predictions of precipitation using Light Gradient Boosting Machine
(LightGBM). LightGBM is a boosting algorithm, highlighted by prize-winning
entries in prediction and forecasting competitions. To assess LightGBM, we
contribute a large-scale application that includes merging daily precipitation
measurements in contiguous US with PERSIANN and GPM-IMERG satellite
precipitation data. We focus on extreme quantiles of the probability
distribution of the dependent variable, where LightGBM outperforms quantile
regression forests (QRF, a variant of random forests) in terms of quantile
score at extreme quantiles. Our study offers understanding of probabilistic

(GNNs) on a given graph topology by dynamically learning it. However, most of
LGI methods assume to have a (noisy, incomplete, improvable, ...) input graph
to rewire and can solely learn regular graph topologies. In the wake of the
success of Topological Deep Learning (TDL), we study Latent Topology Inference
(LTI) for learning higher-order cell complexes (with sparse and not regular
topology) describing multi-way interactions between data points. To this aim,
we introduce the Differentiable Cell Complex Module (DCM), a novel learnable
function that computes cell probabilities in the complex to improve the
downstream task. We show how to integrate DCM with cell complex message passing
networks layers and train it in a end-to-end fashion, thanks to a two-step
inference procedure that avoids an exhaustive search across all possible cells
in the input, thus maintaining scalability. Our model is tested on several

sources of uncertainty to be taken into account. In particular, the
time-repeating observations-to-decisions flow is modeled using a dynamic
Bayesian network. Real-time structural health diagnostics are provided by
assimilating sensed data with deep learning models. The digital twin state is
continually updated in a sequential Bayesian inference fashion. This is then
exploited to inform the optimal planning of maintenance and management actions
within a dynamic decision-making framework. A preliminary offline phase
involves the population of training datasets through a reduced-order numerical
model and the computation of a health-dependent control policy. The strategy is
assessed on two synthetic case studies, involving a cantilever beam and a
railway bridge, demonstrating the dynamic decision-making capabilities of
health-aware digital twins.</span>

                              <span>Mesh-based simulations play a key role when modeling complex physical systems
that, in many disciplines across science and engineering, require the solution
of parametrized time-dependent nonlinear partial differential equations (PDEs).
In this context, full order models (FOMs), such as those relying on the finite
element method, can reach high levels of accuracy, however often yielding
intensive simulations to run. For this reason, surrogate models are developed
to replace computationally expensive solvers with more efficient ones, which
can strike favorable trade-offs between accuracy and efficiency. This work
explores the potential usage of graph neural networks (GNNs) for the simulation
of time-dependent PDEs in the presence of geometrical variability. In
particular, we propose a systematic strategy to build surrogate models based on
a data-driven time-stepping scheme where a GNN architecture is used to
efficiently evolve the system. With respect to the majority of surrogate
models, the proposed approach stands out for its ability of tackling problems
with parameter dependent spatial domains, while simultaneously generalizing to
different geometries and mesh resolutions. We assess the effectiveness of the
proposed approach through a series of numerical experiments, involving both
two- and three-dimensional problems, showing that GNNs can provide a valid
alternative to traditional surrogate models in terms of computational
efficiency and generalization to new scenarios. We also assess, from a
numerical standpoint, the importance of using GNNs, rather than classical dense
deep neural networks, for the proposed framework.</span>

                              <span>Label Distribution Learning (LDL) is a novel machine learning paradigm that
assigns label distribution to each instance. Many LDL methods proposed to
leverage label correlation in the learning process to solve the
exponential-sized output space; among these, many exploited the low-rank
structure of label distribution to capture label correlation. However, recent
studies disclosed that label distribution matrices are typically full-rank,
posing challenges to those works exploiting low-rank label correlation. Note
that multi-label is generally low-rank; low-rank label correlation is widely
adopted in multi-label learning (MLL) literature. Inspired by that, we
introduce an auxiliary MLL process in LDL and capture low-rank label
correlation on that MLL rather than LDL. In such a way, low-rank label
correlation is appropriately exploited in our LDL methods. We conduct
comprehensive experiments and demonstrate that our methods are superior to
existing LDL methods. Besides, the ablation studies justify the advantages of
exploiting low-rank label correlation in the auxiliary MLL.</span>

                              <span>We study the online overlapping batch-means covariance estimator for
Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) under Markovian sampling. We show that the
convergence rates of the covariance estimator are
$O\big(\sqrt{d}\,n^{-1/8}(\log n)^{1/4}\big)$ and
$O\big(\sqrt{d}\,n^{-1/8}\big)$ under state-dependent and state-independent
Markovian sampling, respectively, with $d$ representing dimensionality and $n$
denoting the number of observations or SGD iterations. Remarkably, these rates
match the best-known convergence rate previously established for the
independent and identically distributed ($\iid$) case by \cite{zhu2021online},
up to logarithmic factors. Our analysis overcomes significant challenges that
arise due to Markovian sampling, leading to the introduction of additional
error terms and complex dependencies between the blocks of the batch-means
covariance estimator. Moreover, we establish the convergence rate for the first
four moments of the $\ell_2$ norm of the error of SGD dynamics under
state-dependent Markovian data, which holds potential interest as an
independent result. To validate our theoretical findings, we provide numerical
illustrations to derive confidence intervals for SGD when training linear and
logistic regression models under Markovian sampling. Additionally, we apply our
approach to tackle the intriguing problem of strategic classification with
logistic regression, where adversaries can adaptively modify features during

                              <span>We consider convex relaxations for recovering low-rank tensors based on
constrained minimization over a ball induced by the tensor nuclear norm,
recently introduced in \cite{tensor_tSVD}. We build on a recent line of results
that considered convex relaxations for the recovery of low-rank matrices and
established that under a strict complementarity condition (SC), both the
convergence rate and per-iteration runtime of standard gradient methods may
improve dramatically. We develop the appropriate strict complementarity
condition for the tensor nuclear norm ball and obtain the following main
results under this condition: 1. When the objective to minimize is of the form
$f(\mX)&#x3D;g(\mA\mX)+\langle{\mC,\mX}\rangle$ , where $g$ is strongly convex and
$\mA$ is a linear map (e.g., least squares), a quadratic growth bound holds,
which implies linear convergence rates for standard projected gradient methods,
despite the fact that $f$ need not be strongly convex. 2. For a smooth
objective function, when initialized in certain proximity of an optimal
solution which satisfies SC, standard projected gradient methods only require
SVD computations (for projecting onto the tensor nuclear norm ball) of rank
that matches the tubal rank of the optimal solution. In particular, when the
tubal rank is constant, this implies nearly linear (in the size of the tensor)
runtime per iteration, as opposed to super linear without further assumptions.
3. For a nonsmooth objective function which admits a popular smooth
saddle-point formulation, we derive similar results to the latter for the well
known extragradient method. An additional contribution which may be of
independent interest, is the rigorous extension of many basic results regarding
tensors of arbitrary order, which were previously obtained only for third-order

                              <span>In this paper, we investigate the impact of compression on stochastic
gradient algorithms for machine learning, a technique widely used in
distributed and federated learning. We underline differences in terms of
convergence rates between several unbiased compression operators, that all
satisfy the same condition on their variance, thus going beyond the classical
worst-case analysis. To do so, we focus on the case of least-squares regression
(LSR) and analyze a general stochastic approximation algorithm for minimizing
quadratic functions relying on a random field. We consider weak assumptions on
the random field, tailored to the analysis (specifically, expected H\&quot;older
regularity), and on the noise covariance, enabling the analysis of various
randomizing mechanisms, including compression. We then extend our results to
the case of federated learning.

More formally, we highlight the impact on the convergence of the covariance
$\mathfrak{C}_{\mathrm{ania}}$ of the additive noise induced by the algorithm.
We demonstrate despite the non-regularity of the stochastic field, that the
limit variance term scales with $\mathrm{Tr}(\mathfrak{C}_{\mathrm{ania}}
H^{-1})/K$ (where $H$ is the Hessian of the optimization problem and $K$ the
number of iterations) generalizing the rate for the vanilla LSR case where it
is $\sigma^2 \mathrm{Tr}(H H^{-1}) / K &#x3D; \sigma^2 d / K$ (Bach and Moulines,
2013). Then, we analyze the dependency of $\mathfrak{C}_{\mathrm{ania}}$ on the
compression strategy and ultimately its impact on convergence, first in the
centralized case, then in two heterogeneous FL frameworks.</span>

                              <span>The literature on machine learning in the context of data streams is vast and
growing. However, many of the defining assumptions regarding data-stream
learning tasks are too strong to hold in practice, or are even contradictory
such that they cannot be met in the contexts of supervised learning. Algorithms
are chosen and designed based on criteria which are often not clearly stated,
for problem settings not clearly defined, tested in unrealistic settings,
and/or in isolation from related approaches in the wider literature. This puts
into question the potential for real-world impact of many approaches conceived
in such contexts, and risks propagating a misguided research focus. We propose
to tackle these issues by reformulating the fundamental definitions and
settings of supervised data-stream learning with regard to contemporary
considerations of concept drift and temporal dependence; and we take a fresh
look at what constitutes a supervised data-stream learning task, and a
reconsideration of algorithms that may be applied to tackle such tasks. Through
and in reflection of this formulation and overview, helped by an informal
survey of industrial players dealing with real-world data streams, we provide
recommendations. Our main emphasis is that learning from data streams does not
impose a single-pass or online-learning approach, or any particular learning
regime; and any constraints on memory and time are not specific to streaming.
Meanwhile, there exist established techniques for dealing with temporal
dependence and concept drift, in other areas of the literature. For the data
streams community, we thus encourage a shift in research focus, from dealing
with often-artificial constraints and assumptions on the learning mode, to
issues such as robustness, privacy, and interpretability which are increasingly
relevant to learning in data streams in academic and industrial settings.</span>

                              <span>Despite the proliferation of diverse hardware accelerators (e.g., NPU, TPU,
DPU), deploying deep learning models on edge devices with fixed-point hardware
is still challenging due to complex model quantization and conversion. Existing
model quantization frameworks like Tensorflow QAT [1], TFLite PTQ [2], and
Qualcomm AIMET [3] supports only a limited set of quantization schemes (e.g.,
only asymmetric per-tensor quantization in TF1.x QAT [4]). Accordingly, deep
learning models cannot be easily quantized for diverse fixed-point hardwares,
mainly due to slightly different quantization requirements. In this paper, we
envision a new type of model quantization approach called MRQ (model
re-quantization), which takes existing quantized models and quickly transforms
the models to meet different quantization requirements (e.g., asymmetric -&gt;
symmetric, non-power-of-2 scale -&gt; power-of-2 scale). Re-quantization is much
simpler than quantizing from scratch because it avoids costly re-training and
provides support for multiple quantization schemes simultaneously. To minimize
re-quantization error, we developed a new set of re-quantization algorithms
including weight correction and rounding error folding. We have demonstrated
that MobileNetV2 QAT model [7] can be quickly re-quantized into two different
quantization schemes (i.e., symmetric and symmetric+power-of-2 scale) with less
than 0.64 units of accuracy loss. We believe our work is the first to leverage
this concept of re-quantization for model quantization and models obtained from
the re-quantization process have been successfully deployed on NNA in the Echo

                              <span>Identification of nonlinear dynamical systems has been popularized by sparse
identification of the nonlinear dynamics (SINDy) via the sequentially
thresholded least squares (STLS) algorithm. Many extensions SINDy have emerged
in the literature to deal with experimental data which are finite in length and
noisy. Recently, the computationally intensive method of ensembling
bootstrapped SINDy models (E-SINDy) was proposed for model identification,
handling finite, highly noisy data. While the extensions of SINDy are numerous,
their sparsity-promoting estimators occasionally provide sparse approximations
of the dynamics as opposed to exact recovery. Furthermore, these estimators
suffer under multicollinearity, e.g. the irrepresentable condition for the
Lasso. In this paper, we demonstrate that the Trimmed Lasso for robust
identification of models (TRIM) can provide exact recovery under more severe
noise, finite data, and multicollinearity as opposed to E-SINDy. Additionally,
the computational cost of TRIM is asymptotically equal to STLS since the
sparsity parameter of the TRIM can be solved efficiently by convex solvers. We
compare these methodologies on challenging nonlinear systems, specifically the
Lorenz 63 system, the Bouc Wen oscillator from the nonlinear dynamics benchmark
of No\&quot;el and Schoukens, 2016, and a time delay system describing tool cutting
dynamics. This study emphasizes the comparisons between STLS, reweighted
$\ell_1$ minimization, and Trimmed Lasso in identification with respect to
problems faced by practitioners: the problem of finite and noisy data, the
performance of the sparse regression of when the library grows in dimension
(multicollinearity), and automatic methods for choice of regularization
parameters.</span>

evolution and assess the impacts of climate change. However, they often operate
at a coarse spatial resolution that limits their accuracy in reproducing
local-scale phenomena. Statistical downscaling methods leveraging deep learning
offer a solution to this problem by approximating local-scale climate fields
from coarse variables, thus enabling regional GCM projections. Typically,
climate fields of different variables of interest are downscaled independently,
resulting in violations of fundamental physical properties across

                              <span>Are current language models capable of deception and lie detection? We study
this question by introducing a text-based game called $\textit{Hoodwinked}$,
inspired by $\textit{Mafia}$ and $\textit{Among Us}$. Players are locked in a
house and must find a key to escape, but one player is tasked with killing the
others. Each time a murder is committed, the surviving players have a natural
language discussion then vote to banish one player from the game. We conduct
experiments with agents controlled by GPT-3, GPT-3.5, and GPT-4 and find
evidence of deception and lie detection capabilities. The killer often denies
their crime and accuses others, leading to measurable effects on voting
outcomes. More advanced models are more effective killers, outperforming
smaller models in 18 of 24 pairwise comparisons. Secondary metrics provide
evidence that this improvement is not mediated by different actions, but rather
by stronger deception capabilities during discussions. Overall, we find
substantial evidence that current language models are capable of deception. To
better evaluate the ability of AI agents to deceive humans, we make this game

                              <span>Cost-effective sensors are capable of real-time capturing a variety of air
quality-related modalities from different pollutant concentrations to
indoor/outdoor humidity and temperature. Machine learning (ML) models are
capable of performing air-quality &quot;ahead-of-time&quot; approximations. Undoubtedly,
accurate indoor air quality approximation significantly helps provide a healthy
indoor environment, optimize associated energy consumption, and offer human
comfort. However, it is crucial to design an ML architecture to capture the
domain knowledge, so-called problem physics. In this study, we propose six
novel physics-based ML models for accurate indoor pollutant concentration
approximations. The proposed models include an adroit combination of
state-space concepts in physics, Gated Recurrent Units, and Decomposition
techniques. The proposed models were illustrated using data collected from five
offices in a commercial building in California. The proposed models are shown
to be less complex, computationally more efficient, and more accurate than
similar state-of-the-art transformer-based models. The superiority of the
proposed models is due to their relatively light architecture (computational
efficiency) and, more importantly, their ability to capture the underlying

                              <span>The diffusion model is capable of generating high-quality data through a
probabilistic approach. However, it suffers from the drawback of slow
generation speed due to the requirement of a large number of time steps. To
address this limitation, recent models such as denoising diffusion implicit
models (DDIM) focus on generating samples without directly modeling the
probability distribution, while models like denoising diffusion generative
adversarial networks (GAN) combine diffusion processes with GANs. In the field
of speech synthesis, a recent diffusion speech synthesis model called
DiffGAN-TTS, utilizing the structure of GANs, has been introduced and
demonstrates superior performance in both speech quality and generation speed.
In this paper, to further enhance the performance of DiffGAN-TTS, we propose a
speech synthesis model with two discriminators: a diffusion discriminator for
learning the distribution of the reverse process and a spectrogram
discriminator for learning the distribution of the generated data. Objective
metrics such as structural similarity index measure (SSIM), mel-cepstral
distortion (MCD), F0 root mean squared error (F0 RMSE), short-time objective
intelligibility (STOI), perceptual evaluation of speech quality (PESQ), as well
as subjective metrics like mean opinion score (MOS), are used to evaluate the
performance of the proposed model. The evaluation results show that the
proposed model outperforms recent state-of-the-art models such as FastSpeech2

                              <span>In response to recent data regulation requirements, machine unlearning (MU)
has emerged as a critical process to remove the influence of specific examples
from a given model. Although exact unlearning can be achieved through complete
model retraining using the remaining dataset, the associated computational
costs have driven the development of efficient, approximate unlearning
techniques. Moving beyond data-centric MU approaches, our study introduces a
novel model-based perspective: model sparsification via weight pruning, which
is capable of reducing the gap between exact unlearning and approximate
unlearning. We show in both theory and practice that model sparsity can boost
the multi-criteria unlearning performance of an approximate unlearner, closing
the approximation gap, while continuing to be efficient. This leads to a new MU
paradigm, termed prune first, then unlearn, which infuses a sparse model prior
into the unlearning process. Building on this insight, we also develop a
sparsity-aware unlearning method that utilizes sparsity regularization to
enhance the training process of approximate unlearning. Extensive experiments
show that our proposals consistently benefit MU in various unlearning
scenarios. A notable highlight is the 77% unlearning efficacy gain of
fine-tuning (one of the simplest unlearning methods) when using sparsity-aware
unlearning. Furthermore, we demonstrate the practical impact of our proposed MU
methods in addressing other machine learning challenges, such as defending
against backdoor attacks and enhancing transfer learning. Codes are available

endless applications. Well planned schedules bring many benefits in the context
of automated systems: among others, they limit production costs and waste.
Nevertheless, the NP-hardness of this problem makes it essential to use
heuristics whose design is difficult, requires specialized knowledge and often
produces methods tailored to the specific task. This paper presents an original
end-to-end Deep Reinforcement Learning approach to scheduling that

                              <span>Learning priors on trajectory distributions can help accelerate robot motion
planning optimization. Given previously successful plans, learning trajectory
generative models as priors for a new planning problem is highly desirable.
Prior works propose several ways on utilizing this prior to bootstrapping the
motion planning problem. Either sampling the prior for initializations or using
the prior distribution in a maximum-a-posterior formulation for trajectory
optimization. In this work, we propose learning diffusion models as priors. We
then can sample directly from the posterior trajectory distribution conditioned
on task goals, by leveraging the inverse denoising process of diffusion models.
Furthermore, diffusion has been recently shown to effectively encode data
multimodality in high-dimensional settings, which is particularly well-suited
for large trajectory dataset. To demonstrate our method efficacy, we compare
our proposed method - Motion Planning Diffusion - against several baselines in
simulated planar robot and 7-dof robot arm manipulator environments. To assess
the generalization capabilities of our method, we test it in environments with
previously unseen obstacles. Our experiments show that diffusion models are
strong priors to encode high-dimensional trajectory distributions of robot

                              <span>One of the key objects of binary classification is the regression function,
i.e., the conditional expectation of the class labels given the inputs. With
the regression function not only a Bayes optimal classifier can be defined, but
it also encodes the corresponding misclassification probabilities. The paper
presents a resampling framework to construct exact, distribution-free and
non-asymptotically guaranteed confidence regions for the true regression
function for any user-chosen confidence level. Then, specific algorithms are
suggested to demonstrate the framework. It is proved that the constructed
confidence regions are strongly consistent, that is, any false model is
excluded in the long run with probability one. The exclusion is quantified with
probably approximately correct type bounds, as well. Finally, the algorithms
are validated via numerical experiments, and the methods are compared to
approximate asymptotic confidence ellipsoids.</span>

                              <span>$Q$ learning is a popular model free reinforcement learning method. Most of
existing works focus on analyzing $Q$ learning for finite state and action
spaces. If the state space is continuous, then the original $Q$ learning method
can not be directly used. A modification of the original $Q$ learning method
was proposed in (Shah and Xie, 2018), which estimates $Q$ values with nearest
neighbors. Such modification makes $Q$ learning suitable for continuous state
space. (Shah and Xie, 2018) shows that the convergence rate of estimated $Q$
function is $\tilde{O}(T^{-1/(d+3)})$, which is slower than the minimax lower
bound $\tilde{\Omega}(T^{-1/(d+2)})$, indicating that this method is not
efficient. This paper proposes two new $Q$ learning methods to bridge the gap
of convergence rates in (Shah and Xie, 2018), with one of them being offline,
while the other is online. Despite that we still use nearest neighbor approach
to estimate $Q$ function, the algorithms are crucially different from (Shah and
Xie, 2018). In particular, we replace the kernel nearest neighbor in
discretized region with a direct nearest neighbor approach. Consequently, our
approach significantly improves the convergence rate. Moreover, the time
complexity is also significantly improved in high dimensional state spaces. Our
analysis shows that both offline and online methods are minimax rate optimal.</span>

                              <span>Face swapping is a task that changes a facial identity of a given image to
that of another person. In this work, we propose a novel face-swapping
framework called Megapixel Facial Identity Manipulation (MFIM). The
face-swapping model should achieve two goals. First, it should be able to
generate a high-quality image. We argue that a model which is proficient in
generating a megapixel image can achieve this goal. However, generating a
megapixel image is generally difficult without careful model design. Therefore,
our model exploits pretrained StyleGAN in the manner of GAN-inversion to
effectively generate a megapixel image. Second, it should be able to
effectively transform the identity of a given image. Specifically, it should be
able to actively transform ID attributes (e.g., face shape and eyes) of a given
image into those of another person, while preserving ID-irrelevant attributes
(e.g., pose and expression). To achieve this goal, we exploit 3DMM that can
capture various facial attributes. Specifically, we explicitly supervise our
model to generate a face-swapped image with the desirable attributes using
3DMM. We show that our model achieves state-of-the-art performance through
extensive experiments. Furthermore, we propose a new operation called ID
mixing, which creates a new identity by semantically mixing the identities of
several people. It allows the user to customize the new identity.</span>

                              <span>In this work we approach attractor neural networks from a machine learning
perspective: we look for optimal network parameters by applying a gradient
descent over a regularized loss function. Within this framework, the optimal
neuron-interaction matrices turn out to be a class of matrices which correspond
to Hebbian kernels revised by iteratively applying some unlearning protocols.
Remarkably, the number of unlearning steps is proved to be related to the
regularization hyperparameters of the loss function and to the training time.
Thus, we can design strategies to avoid overfitting that are formulated in
terms of the algebraic properties of the interaction matrix, or, equivalently,
in terms of regularization tuning and early-stopping strategies. The
generalization capabilities of these attractor networks are also investigated:
analytical results are obtained for random synthetic datasets, next, the
emerging picture is corroborated by numerical experiments that highlight the
existence of several regimes (i.e., overfitting, failure and success) as the
dataset parameters are varied.</span>

                              <span>Human intelligence excels at combining basic skills to solve complex tasks.
This capability is vital for Artificial Intelligence (AI) and should be
embedded in comprehensive intelligent models, enabling them to harness expert
models for complex task-solving towards Artificial General Intelligence (AGI).
Large Language Models (LLMs) show promising learning and reasoning abilities,
and can effectively use external models, tools or APIs to tackle complex
problems. In this work, we introduce OpenAGI, an open-source AGI research
platform designed for multi-step, real-world tasks. Specifically, OpenAGI uses
a dual strategy, integrating standard benchmark tasks for benchmarking and
evaluation, and open-ended tasks including more expandable models, tools or
APIs for creative problem-solving. Tasks are presented as natural language
queries to the LLM, which then selects and executes appropriate models. We also
propose a Reinforcement Learning from Task Feedback (RLTF) mechanism that uses
task results to improve the LLM&#x27;s ability, which creates a self-improving AI
feedback loop. While we acknowledge that AGI is a broad and multifaceted
research challenge with no singularly defined solution path, the integration of
LLMs with domain-specific expert models, inspired by mirroring the blend of
general and specialized intelligence in humans, offers a promising approach
towards AGI. We are open-sourcing the OpenAGI project&#x27;s code, dataset,
benchmarks, evaluation methods, and demo to foster community involvement in AGI
advancement: https://github.com/agiresearch/OpenAGI.</span>

                              <span>Long exposure photography produces stunning imagery, representing moving
elements in a scene with motion-blur. It is generally employed in two
modalities, producing either a foreground or a background blur effect.
Foreground blur images are traditionally captured on a tripod-mounted camera
and portray blurred moving foreground elements, such as silky water or light
trails, over a perfectly sharp background landscape. Background blur images,
also called panning photography, are captured while the camera is tracking a
moving subject, to produce an image of a sharp subject over a background
blurred by relative motion. Both techniques are notoriously challenging and
require additional equipment and advanced skills. In this paper, we describe a
computational burst photography system that operates in a hand-held smartphone
camera app, and achieves these effects fully automatically, at the tap of the
shutter button. Our approach first detects and segments the salient subject. We
track the scene motion over multiple frames and align the images in order to
preserve desired sharpness and to produce aesthetically pleasing motion
streaks. We capture an under-exposed burst and select the subset of input
frames that will produce blur trails of controlled length, regardless of scene
or camera motion velocity. We predict inter-frame motion and synthesize
motion-blur to fill the temporal gaps between the input frames. Finally, we
composite the blurred image with the sharp regular exposure to protect the
sharpness of faces or areas of the scene that are barely moving, and produce a
final high resolution and high dynamic range (HDR) photograph. Our system
democratizes a capability previously reserved to professionals, and makes this
creative style accessible to most casual photographers.

vision models for automatic recognition of emotion expression can aid in a
variety of domains, including robotics, digital behavioral healthcare, and
media analytics. There are three types of emotional representations which are
traditionally modeled in affective computing research: Action Units, Valence
Arousal (VA), and Categorical Emotions. As part of an effort to move beyond
these representations towards more fine-grained labels, we describe our
submission to the newly introduced Emotional Reaction Intensity (ERI)
Estimation challenge in the 5th competition for Affective Behavior Analysis
in-the-Wild (ABAW). We developed four deep neural networks trained in the
visual domain and a multimodal model trained with both visual and audio
features to predict emotion reaction intensity. Our best performing model on
the Hume-Reaction dataset achieved an average Pearson correlation coefficient
of 0.4080 on the test set using a pre-trained ResNet50 model. This work

                              <span>Predictive variability due to data ambiguities has typically been addressed
via construction of dedicated models with built-in probabilistic capabilities
that are trained to predict uncertainty estimates as variables of interest.
These approaches require distinct architectural components and training
mechanisms, may include restrictive assumptions and exhibit overconfidence,
i.e., high confidence in imprecise predictions. In this work, we propose a
post-hoc sampling strategy for estimating predictive uncertainty accounting for
data ambiguity. The method can generate different plausible outputs for a given
input and does not assume parametric forms of predictive distributions. It is
architecture agnostic and can be applied to any feed-forward deterministic
network without changes to the architecture or training procedure. Experiments
on regression tasks on imaging and non-imaging input data show the method&#x27;s

                              <span>Recently, bi-level optimization (BLO) has taken center stage in some very
exciting developments in the area of signal processing (SP) and machine
learning (ML). Roughly speaking, BLO is a classical optimization problem that
involves two levels of hierarchy (i.e., upper and lower levels), wherein
obtaining the solution to the upper-level problem requires solving the
lower-level one. BLO has become popular largely because it is powerful in
modeling problems in SP and ML, among others, that involve optimizing nested
objective functions. Prominent applications of BLO range from resource
allocation for wireless systems to adversarial machine learning. In this work,
we focus on a class of tractable BLO problems that often appear in SP and ML
applications. We provide an overview of some basic concepts of this class of
BLO problems, such as their optimality conditions, standard algorithms
(including their optimization principles and practical implementations), as
well as how they can be leveraged to obtain state-of-the-art results for a
number of key SP and ML applications. Further, we discuss some recent advances
in BLO theory, its implications for applications, and point out some
limitations of the state-of-the-art that require significant future research
efforts. Overall, we hope that this article can serve to accelerate the
adoption of BLO as a generic tool to model, analyze, and innovate on a wide
array of emerging SP and ML applications.</span>

                              <span>With the advent of the big data era, the data quality problem is becoming
more critical. Among many factors, data with missing values is one primary
issue, and thus developing effective imputation models is a key topic in the
research community. Recently, a major research direction is to employ neural
network models such as self-organizing mappings or automatic encoders for
filling missing values. However, these classical methods can hardly discover
interrelated features and common features simultaneously among data attributes.
Especially, it is a very typical problem for classical autoencoders that they
often learn invalid constant mappings, which dramatically hurts the filling
performance. To solve the above-mentioned problems, we propose a
missing-value-filling model based on a feature-fusion-enhanced autoencoder. We
first incorporate into an autoencoder a hidden layer that consists of
de-tracking neurons and radial basis function neurons, which can enhance the
ability of learning interrelated features and common features. Besides, we
develop a missing value filling strategy based on dynamic clustering that is
incorporated into an iterative optimization process. This design can enhance
the multi-dimensional feature fusion ability and thus improves the dynamic
collaborative missing-value-filling performance. The effectiveness of the
proposed model is validated by extensive experiments compared to a variety of
baseline methods on thirteen data sets.</span>

                              <span>Recent approximations to backpropagation (BP) have mitigated many of BP&#x27;s
computational inefficiencies and incompatibilities with biology, but important
limitations still remain. Moreover, the approximations significantly decrease
accuracy in benchmarks, suggesting that an entirely different approach may be
more fruitful. Here, grounded on recent theory for Hebbian learning in soft
winner-take-all networks, we present multilayer SoftHebb, i.e. an algorithm
that trains deep neural networks, without any feedback, target, or error
signals. As a result, it achieves efficiency by avoiding weight transport,
non-local plasticity, time-locking of layer updates, iterative equilibria, and
(self-) supervisory or other feedback signals -- which were necessary in other
approaches. Its increased efficiency and biological compatibility do not trade
off accuracy compared to state-of-the-art bio-plausible learning, but rather
improve it. With up to five hidden layers and an added linear classifier,
accuracies on MNIST, CIFAR-10, STL-10, and ImageNet, respectively reach 99.4%,
80.3%, 76.2%, and 27.3%. In conclusion, SoftHebb shows with a radically
different approach from BP that Deep Learning over few layers may be plausible
in the brain and increases the accuracy of bio-plausible machine learning. Code

                              <span>Real-time rendering for video games has become increasingly challenging due
to the need for higher resolutions, framerates and photorealism. Supersampling
has emerged as an effective solution to address this challenge. Our work
introduces a novel neural algorithm for supersampling rendered content that is
4 times more efficient than existing methods while maintaining the same level
of accuracy. Additionally, we introduce a new dataset which provides auxiliary
modalities such as motion vectors and depth generated using graphics rendering
features like viewport jittering and mipmap biasing at different resolutions.
We believe that this dataset fills a gap in the current dataset landscape and
can serve as a valuable resource to help measure progress in the field and
advance the state-of-the-art in super-resolution techniques for gaming content.</span>

                              <span>We present a new algorithm for automatically bounding the Taylor remainder
series. In the special case of a scalar function $f: \mathbb{R} \to
\mathbb{R}$, our algorithm takes as input a reference point $x_0$, trust region
$[a, b]$, and integer $k \ge 1$, and returns an interval $I$ such that $f(x) -
\sum_{i&#x3D;0}^{k-1} \frac {1} {i!} f^{(i)}(x_0) (x - x_0)^i \in I (x - x_0)^k$ for
all $x \in [a, b]$. As in automatic differentiation, the function $f$ is
provided to the algorithm in symbolic form, and must be composed of known
atomic functions.

At a high level, our algorithm has two steps. First, for a variety of
commonly-used elementary functions (e.g., $\exp$, $\log$), we use
recently-developed theory to derive sharp polynomial upper and lower bounds on
the Taylor remainder series. We then recursively combine the bounds for the
elementary functions using an interval arithmetic variant of Taylor-mode
automatic differentiation. Our algorithm can make efficient use of machine
learning hardware accelerators, and we provide an open source implementation in
JAX.

We then turn our attention to applications. Most notably, in a companion
paper we use our new machinery to create the first universal
majorization-minimization optimization algorithms: algorithms that iteratively
minimize an arbitrary loss using a majorizer that is derived automatically,
rather than by hand. We also show that our automatically-derived bounds can be
used for verified global optimization and numerical integration, and to prove
sharper versions of Jensen&#x27;s inequality.</span>

                              <span>With the advancement of DNNs into safety-critical applications, testing
approaches for such models have gained more attention. A current direction is
the search for and identification of systematic weaknesses that put safety
assumptions based on average performance values at risk. Such weaknesses can
take on the form of (semantically coherent) subsets or areas in the input space
where a DNN performs systematically worse than its expected average. However,
it is non-trivial to attribute the reason for such observed low performances to
the specific semantic features that describe the subset. For instance,
inhomogeneities within the data w.r.t. other (non-considered) attributes might
distort results. However, taking into account all (available) attributes and
their interaction is often computationally highly expensive. Inspired by
counterfactual explanations, we propose an effective and computationally cheap
algorithm to validate the semantic attribution of existing subsets, i.e., to
check whether the identified attribute is likely to have caused the degraded
performance. We demonstrate this approach on an example from the autonomous
driving domain using highly annotated simulated data, where we show for a
semantic segmentation model that (i) performance differences among the
different pedestrian assets exist, but (ii) only in some cases is the asset
type itself the reason for this reduction in the performance.</span>

                              <span>To interact with humans in the world, agents need to understand the diverse
types of language that people use, relate them to the visual world, and act
based on them. While current agents learn to execute simple language
instructions from task rewards, we aim to build agents that leverage diverse
language that conveys general knowledge, describes the state of the world,
provides interactive feedback, and more. Our key idea is that language helps
agents predict the future: what will be observed, how the world will behave,
and which situations will be rewarded. This perspective unifies language
understanding with future prediction as a powerful self-supervised learning
objective. We present Dynalang, an agent that learns a multimodal world model
that predicts future text and image representations and learns to act from
imagined model rollouts. Unlike traditional agents that use language only to
predict actions, Dynalang acquires rich language understanding by using past
language also to predict future language, video, and rewards. In addition to
learning from online interaction in an environment, Dynalang can be pretrained
on datasets of text, video, or both without actions or rewards. From using
language hints in grid worlds to navigating photorealistic scans of homes,
Dynalang utilizes diverse types of language to improve task performance,
including environment descriptions, game rules, and instructions.</span>

                              <span>Multi-label image recognition in the low-label regime is a task of great
challenge and practical significance. Previous works have focused on learning
the alignment between textual and visual spaces to compensate for limited image
labels, yet may suffer from reduced accuracy due to the scarcity of
high-quality multi-label annotations. In this research, we leverage the
powerful alignment between textual and visual features pretrained with millions
of auxiliary image-text pairs. We introduce an efficient and effective
framework called Evidence-guided Dual Context Optimization (DualCoOp++), which
serves as a unified approach for addressing partial-label and zero-shot
multi-label recognition. In DualCoOp++ we separately encode evidential,
positive, and negative contexts for target classes as parametric components of
the linguistic input (i.e., prompts). The evidential context aims to discover
all the related visual content for the target class, and serves as guidance to
aggregate positive and negative contexts from the spatial domain of the image,
enabling better distinguishment between similar categories. Additionally, we
introduce a Winner-Take-All module that promotes inter-class interaction during
training, while avoiding the need for extra parameters and costs. As DualCoOp++
imposes minimal additional learnable overhead on the pretrained vision-language
framework, it enables rapid adaptation to multi-label recognition tasks with
limited annotations and even unseen classes. Experiments on standard
multi-label recognition benchmarks across two challenging low-label settings
demonstrate the superior performance of our approach compared to
state-of-the-art methods.</span>

                              <span>Extensive research has been conducted on fault diagnosis of planetary
gearboxes using vibration signals and deep learning (DL) approaches. However,
DL-based methods are susceptible to the domain shift problem caused by varying
operating conditions of the gearbox. Although domain adaptation and data
synthesis methods have been proposed to overcome such domain shifts, they are
often not directly applicable in real-world situations where only healthy data
is available in the target domain. To tackle the challenge of extreme domain
shift scenarios where only healthy data is available in the target domain, this
paper proposes two novel domain knowledge-informed data synthesis methods
utilizing the health data map (HDMap). The two proposed approaches are referred
to as scaled CutPaste and FaultPaste. The HDMap is used to physically represent
the vibration signal of the planetary gearbox as an image-like matrix, allowing
for visualization of fault-related features. CutPaste and FaultPaste are then
applied to generate faulty samples based on the healthy data in the target
domain, using domain knowledge and fault signatures extracted from the source
domain, respectively. In addition to generating realistic faults, the proposed
methods introduce scaling of fault signatures for controlled synthesis of
faults with various severity levels. A case study is conducted on a planetary
gearbox testbed to evaluate the proposed approaches. The results show that the
proposed methods are capable of accurately diagnosing faults, even in cases of
extreme domain shift, and can estimate the severity of faults that have not
been previously observed in the target domain.</span>

                              <span>Machine learning models are known to be vulnerable to adversarial evasion
attacks as illustrated by image classification models. Thoroughly understanding
such attacks is critical in order to ensure the safety and robustness of
critical AI tasks. However, most evasion attacks are difficult to deploy
against a majority of AI systems because they have focused on image domain with
only few constraints. An image is composed of homogeneous, numerical,
continuous, and independent features, unlike many other input types to AI
systems used in practice. Furthermore, some input types include additional
semantic and functional constraints that must be observed to generate realistic
adversarial inputs. In this work, we propose a new framework to enable the
generation of adversarial inputs irrespective of the input type and task
domain. Given an input and a set of pre-defined input transformations, our
framework discovers a sequence of transformations that result in a semantically
correct and functional adversarial input. We demonstrate the generality of our
approach on several diverse machine learning tasks with various input

                              <span>As neural networks become more popular, the need for accompanying uncertainty
estimates increases. There are currently two main approaches to test the
quality of these estimates. Most methods output a density. They can be compared
by evaluating their loglikelihood on a test set. Other methods output a
prediction interval directly. These methods are often tested by examining the
fraction of test points that fall inside the corresponding prediction
intervals. Intuitively both approaches seem logical. However, we demonstrate
through both theoretical arguments and simulations that both ways of evaluating
the quality of uncertainty estimates have serious flaws. Firstly, both
approaches cannot disentangle the separate components that jointly create the
predictive uncertainty, making it difficult to evaluate the quality of the
estimates of these components. Secondly, a better loglikelihood does not
guarantee better prediction intervals, which is what the methods are often used
for in practice. Moreover, the current approach to test prediction intervals
directly has additional flaws. We show why it is fundamentally flawed to test a
prediction or confidence interval on a single test set. At best, marginal
coverage is measured, implicitly averaging out overconfident and underconfident
predictions. A much more desirable property is pointwise coverage, requiring
the correct coverage for each prediction. We demonstrate through practical
examples that these effects can result in favoring a method, based on the
predictive uncertainty, that has undesirable behaviour of the confidence or
prediction intervals. Finally, we propose a simulation-based testing approach
that addresses these problems while still allowing easy comparison between
different methods.</span>

                              <span>We present novel cross-sectional and longitudinal claim count models for
vehicle insurance built upon the Combined Actuarial Neural Network (CANN)
framework proposed by Mario W\&quot;uthrich and Michael Merz. The CANN approach
combines a classical actuarial model, such as a generalized linear model, with
a neural network. This blending of models results in a two-component model
comprising a classical regression model and a neural network part. The CANN
model leverages the strengths of both components, providing a solid foundation
and interpretability from the classical model while harnessing the flexibility
and capacity to capture intricate relationships and interactions offered by the
neural network. In our proposed models, we use well-known log-linear claim
count regression models for the classical regression part and a multilayer
perceptron (MLP) for the neural network part. The MLP part is used to process
telematics car driving data given as a vector characterizing the driving
behavior of each insured driver. In addition to the Poisson and negative
binomial distributions for cross-sectional data, we propose a procedure for
training our CANN model with a multivariate negative binomial (MVNB)
specification. By doing so, we introduce a longitudinal model that accounts for
the dependence between contracts from the same insured. Our results reveal that
the CANN models exhibit superior performance compared to log-linear models that
rely on manually engineered telematics features.</span>

                              <span>Single-cell data integration can provide a comprehensive molecular view of
cells, and many algorithms have been developed to remove unwanted technical or
biological variations and integrate heterogeneous single-cell datasets. Despite
their wide usage, existing methods suffer from several fundamental limitations.
In particular, we lack a rigorous statistical test for whether two
high-dimensional single-cell datasets are alignable (and therefore should even
be aligned). Moreover, popular methods can substantially distort the data
during alignment, making the aligned data and downstream analysis difficult to
interpret. To overcome these limitations, we present a spectral manifold
alignment and inference (SMAI) framework, which enables principled and
interpretable alignability testing and structure-preserving integration of
single-cell data. SMAI provides a statistical test to robustly determine the
alignability between datasets to avoid misleading inference, and is justified
by high-dimensional statistical theory. On a diverse range of real and
simulated benchmark datasets, it outperforms commonly used alignment methods.
Moreover, we show that SMAI improves various downstream analyses such as
identification of differentially expressed genes and imputation of single-cell
spatial transcriptomics, providing further biological insights. SMAI&#x27;s
interpretability also enables quantification and a deeper understanding of the
sources of technical confounders in single-cell data.</span>

                              <span>This paper focusses on the optimal implementation of a Mean Variance
Estimation network (MVE network) (Nix and Weigend, 1994). This type of network
is often used as a building block for uncertainty estimation methods in a
regression setting, for instance Concrete dropout (Gal et al., 2017) and Deep
Ensembles (Lakshminarayanan et al., 2017). Specifically, an MVE network assumes
that the data is produced from a normal distribution with a mean function and
variance function. The MVE network outputs a mean and variance estimate and
optimizes the network parameters by minimizing the negative loglikelihood. In
our paper, we present two significant insights. Firstly, the convergence
difficulties reported in recent work can be relatively easily prevented by
following the simple yet often overlooked recommendation from the original
authors that a warm-up period should be used. During this period, only the mean
is optimized with a fixed variance. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this
step through experimentation, highlighting that it should be standard practice.
As a sidenote, we examine whether, after the warm-up, it is beneficial to fix
the mean while optimizing the variance or to optimize both simultaneously.
Here, we do not observe a substantial difference. Secondly, we introduce a
novel improvement of the MVE network: separate regularization of the mean and
the variance estimate. We demonstrate, both on toy examples and on a number of
benchmark UCI regression data sets, that following the original recommendations
and the novel separate regularization can lead to significant improvements.</span>

                              <span>An established normative approach for understanding the algorithmic basis of
neural computation is to derive online algorithms from principled computational
objectives and evaluate their compatibility with anatomical and physiological
observations. Similarity matching objectives have served as successful starting
points for deriving online algorithms that map onto neural networks (NNs) with
point neurons and Hebbian/anti-Hebbian plasticity. These NN models account for
many anatomical and physiological observations; however, the objectives have
limited computational power and the derived NNs do not explain
multi-compartmental neuronal structures and non-Hebbian forms of plasticity
that are prevalent throughout the brain. In this article, we unify and
generalize recent extensions of the similarity matching approach to address
more complex objectives, including a large class of unsupervised and
self-supervised learning tasks that can be formulated as symmetric generalized
eigenvalue problems or nonnegative matrix factorization problems.
Interestingly, the online algorithms derived from these objectives naturally
map onto NNs with multi-compartmental neurons and local, non-Hebbian learning
rules. Therefore, this unified extension of the similarity matching approach
provides a normative framework that facilitates understanding
multi-compartmental neuronal structures and non-Hebbian plasticity found
throughout the brain.</span>

                              <span>We study the online overlapping batch-means covariance estimator for
Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) under Markovian sampling. We show that the
convergence rates of the covariance estimator are
$O\big(\sqrt{d}\,n^{-1/8}(\log n)^{1/4}\big)$ and
$O\big(\sqrt{d}\,n^{-1/8}\big)$ under state-dependent and state-independent
Markovian sampling, respectively, with $d$ representing dimensionality and $n$
denoting the number of observations or SGD iterations. Remarkably, these rates
match the best-known convergence rate previously established for the
independent and identically distributed ($\iid$) case by \cite{zhu2021online},
up to logarithmic factors. Our analysis overcomes significant challenges that
arise due to Markovian sampling, leading to the introduction of additional
error terms and complex dependencies between the blocks of the batch-means
covariance estimator. Moreover, we establish the convergence rate for the first
four moments of the $\ell_2$ norm of the error of SGD dynamics under
state-dependent Markovian data, which holds potential interest as an
independent result. To validate our theoretical findings, we provide numerical
illustrations to derive confidence intervals for SGD when training linear and
logistic regression models under Markovian sampling. Additionally, we apply our
approach to tackle the intriguing problem of strategic classification with
logistic regression, where adversaries can adaptively modify features during
the training process to increase their chances of being classified in a
specific target class.</span>

                              <span>$Q$ learning is a popular model free reinforcement learning method. Most of
existing works focus on analyzing $Q$ learning for finite state and action
spaces. If the state space is continuous, then the original $Q$ learning method
can not be directly used. A modification of the original $Q$ learning method
was proposed in (Shah and Xie, 2018), which estimates $Q$ values with nearest
neighbors. Such modification makes $Q$ learning suitable for continuous state
space. (Shah and Xie, 2018) shows that the convergence rate of estimated $Q$
function is $\tilde{O}(T^{-1/(d+3)})$, which is slower than the minimax lower
bound $\tilde{\Omega}(T^{-1/(d+2)})$, indicating that this method is not
efficient. This paper proposes two new $Q$ learning methods to bridge the gap
of convergence rates in (Shah and Xie, 2018), with one of them being offline,
while the other is online. Despite that we still use nearest neighbor approach
to estimate $Q$ function, the algorithms are crucially different from (Shah and
Xie, 2018). In particular, we replace the kernel nearest neighbor in
discretized region with a direct nearest neighbor approach. Consequently, our
approach significantly improves the convergence rate. Moreover, the time
complexity is also significantly improved in high dimensional state spaces. Our
analysis shows that both offline and online methods are minimax rate optimal.</span>

                              <span>We introduce a novel interpretable tree based algorithm for prediction in a
regression setting. Our motivation is to estimate the unknown regression
function from a functional decomposition perspective in which the functional
components correspond to lower order interaction terms. The idea is to modify
the random forest algorithm by keeping certain leaves after they are split
instead of deleting them. This leads to non-binary trees which we refer to as
planted trees. An extension to a forest leads to our random planted forest
algorithm. Additionally, the maximum number of covariates which can interact
within a leaf can be bounded. If we set this interaction bound to one, the
resulting estimator is a sum of one-dimensional functions. In the other extreme
case, if we do not set a limit, the resulting estimator and corresponding model
place no restrictions on the form of the regression function. In a simulation
study we find encouraging prediction and visualisation properties of our random
planted forest method. We also develop theory for an idealized version of
random planted forests in cases where the interaction bound is low. We show
that if it is smaller than three, the idealized version achieves asymptotically
optimal convergence rates up to a logarithmic factor. Code is available on

optimization. Despite the empirical success of utilizing these systems for
intelligent tasks, the underlying principles that govern their emergent

adversarial attacks, including evasion and backdoor (poisoning) attacks. On the
defense side, there have been intensive efforts on improving both empirical and
provable robustness against evasion attacks; however, the provable robustness
against backdoor attacks still remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we
focus on certifying the machine learning model robustness against general

trained model and certify its robustness against backdoor attacks. We prove the
robustness bound for machine learning models trained with RAB and prove that
our robustness bound is tight. In addition, we theoretically show that it is
possible to train the robust smoothed models efficiently for simple models such
as K-nearest neighbor classifiers, and we propose an exact smooth-training
algorithm that eliminates the need to sample from a noise distribution for such
models. Empirically, we conduct comprehensive experiments for different machine
learning (ML) models such as DNNs, support vector machines, and K-NN models on
MNIST, CIFAR-10, and ImageNette datasets and provide the first benchmark for
certified robustness against backdoor attacks. In addition, we evaluate K-NN
models on a spambase tabular dataset to demonstrate the advantages of the
proposed exact algorithm. Both the theoretic analysis and the comprehensive
evaluation on diverse ML models and datasets shed light on further robust
learning strategies against general training time attacks.</span>

                              <span>As neural networks become more popular, the need for accompanying uncertainty
estimates increases. There are currently two main approaches to test the
quality of these estimates. Most methods output a density. They can be compared
by evaluating their loglikelihood on a test set. Other methods output a
prediction interval directly. These methods are often tested by examining the
fraction of test points that fall inside the corresponding prediction
intervals. Intuitively both approaches seem logical. However, we demonstrate
through both theoretical arguments and simulations that both ways of evaluating
the quality of uncertainty estimates have serious flaws. Firstly, both
approaches cannot disentangle the separate components that jointly create the
predictive uncertainty, making it difficult to evaluate the quality of the
estimates of these components. Secondly, a better loglikelihood does not
guarantee better prediction intervals, which is what the methods are often used
for in practice. Moreover, the current approach to test prediction intervals
directly has additional flaws. We show why it is fundamentally flawed to test a
prediction or confidence interval on a single test set. At best, marginal
coverage is measured, implicitly averaging out overconfident and underconfident
predictions. A much more desirable property is pointwise coverage, requiring
the correct coverage for each prediction. We demonstrate through practical
examples that these effects can result in favoring a method, based on the
predictive uncertainty, that has undesirable behaviour of the confidence or
prediction intervals. Finally, we propose a simulation-based testing approach
that addresses these problems while still allowing easy comparison between
different methods.</span>

                              <span>Accurate predictions, as with machine learning, may not suffice to provide
optimal healthcare for every patient. Indeed, prediction can be driven by
shortcuts in the data, such as racial biases. Causal thinking is needed for
data-driven decisions. Here, we give an introduction to the key elements,
focusing on routinely-collected data, electronic health records (EHRs) and
claims data. Using such data to assess the value of an intervention requires
care: temporal dependencies and existing practices easily confound the causal
effect. We present a step-by-step framework to help build valid decision making
from real-life patient records by emulating a randomized trial before
individualizing decisions, eg with machine learning. Our framework highlights
the most important pitfalls and considerations in analysing EHRs or claims data
to draw causal conclusions. We illustrate the various choices in studying the
effect of albumin on sepsis mortality in the Medical Information Mart for
Intensive Care database (MIMIC-IV). We study the impact of various choices at
every step, from feature extraction to causal-estimator selection. In a
tutorial spirit, the code and the data are openly available.</span>

                              <span>In this paper, we investigate the impact of compression on stochastic
gradient algorithms for machine learning, a technique widely used in
distributed and federated learning. We underline differences in terms of
convergence rates between several unbiased compression operators, that all
satisfy the same condition on their variance, thus going beyond the classical
worst-case analysis. To do so, we focus on the case of least-squares regression
(LSR) and analyze a general stochastic approximation algorithm for minimizing
quadratic functions relying on a random field. We consider weak assumptions on
the random field, tailored to the analysis (specifically, expected H\&quot;older
regularity), and on the noise covariance, enabling the analysis of various
randomizing mechanisms, including compression. We then extend our results to
the case of federated learning.

More formally, we highlight the impact on the convergence of the covariance
$\mathfrak{C}_{\mathrm{ania}}$ of the additive noise induced by the algorithm.
We demonstrate despite the non-regularity of the stochastic field, that the
limit variance term scales with $\mathrm{Tr}(\mathfrak{C}_{\mathrm{ania}}
H^{-1})/K$ (where $H$ is the Hessian of the optimization problem and $K$ the
number of iterations) generalizing the rate for the vanilla LSR case where it
is $\sigma^2 \mathrm{Tr}(H H^{-1}) / K &#x3D; \sigma^2 d / K$ (Bach and Moulines,
2013). Then, we analyze the dependency of $\mathfrak{C}_{\mathrm{ania}}$ on the
compression strategy and ultimately its impact on convergence, first in the
centralized case, then in two heterogeneous FL frameworks.</span>

                              <span>In recent years, multiple notions of algorithmic fairness have arisen. One
such notion is individual fairness (IF), which requires that individuals who
are similar receive similar treatment. In parallel, matrix estimation (ME) has
emerged as a natural paradigm for handling noisy data with missing values. In
this work, we connect the two concepts. We show that pre-processing data using
ME can improve an algorithm&#x27;s IF without sacrificing performance. Specifically,
we show that using a popular ME method known as singular value thresholding
(SVT) to pre-process the data provides a strong IF guarantee under appropriate
conditions. We then show that, under analogous conditions, SVT pre-processing
also yields estimates that are consistent and approximately minimax optimal. As
such, the ME pre-processing step does not, under the stated conditions,
increase the prediction error of the base algorithm, i.e., does not impose a
fairness-performance trade-off. We verify these results on synthetic and real
data.</span>

the correspondence-interleaving distance, a metric for hierarchical clusterings
that we introduce. Taking certain one-parameter slices of degree-Rips recovers
well-known methods for density-based clustering, but we show that these methods
are unstable. However, we prove that degree-Rips, as a multiparameter object,
is stable, and we propose an alternative approach for taking slices of

with better stability properties. We prove that this algorithm is consistent,
using the correspondence-interleaving distance. We provide an algorithm for
extracting a single clustering from one-parameter hierarchical clusterings,
which is stable with respect to the correspondence-interleaving distance. And,
we integrate these methods into a pipeline for density-based clustering, which
we call Persistable. Adapting tools from multiparameter persistent homology, we

                              <span>We consider convex relaxations for recovering low-rank tensors based on
constrained minimization over a ball induced by the tensor nuclear norm,
recently introduced in \cite{tensor_tSVD}. We build on a recent line of results
that considered convex relaxations for the recovery of low-rank matrices and
established that under a strict complementarity condition (SC), both the
convergence rate and per-iteration runtime of standard gradient methods may
improve dramatically. We develop the appropriate strict complementarity
condition for the tensor nuclear norm ball and obtain the following main
results under this condition: 1. When the objective to minimize is of the form
$f(\mX)&#x3D;g(\mA\mX)+\langle{\mC,\mX}\rangle$ , where $g$ is strongly convex and
$\mA$ is a linear map (e.g., least squares), a quadratic growth bound holds,
which implies linear convergence rates for standard projected gradient methods,
despite the fact that $f$ need not be strongly convex. 2. For a smooth
objective function, when initialized in certain proximity of an optimal
solution which satisfies SC, standard projected gradient methods only require
SVD computations (for projecting onto the tensor nuclear norm ball) of rank
that matches the tubal rank of the optimal solution. In particular, when the
tubal rank is constant, this implies nearly linear (in the size of the tensor)
runtime per iteration, as opposed to super linear without further assumptions.
3. For a nonsmooth objective function which admits a popular smooth
saddle-point formulation, we derive similar results to the latter for the well
known extragradient method. An additional contribution which may be of
independent interest, is the rigorous extension of many basic results regarding
tensors of arbitrary order, which were previously obtained only for third-order
tensors.</span>

                              <span>Algorithms for solving the linear classification problem have a long history,
dating back at least to 1936 with linear discriminant analysis. For linearly
separable data, many algorithms can obtain the exact solution to the
corresponding 0-1 loss classification problem efficiently, but for data which
is not linearly separable, it has been shown that this problem, in full
generality, is NP-hard. Alternative approaches all involve approximations of
some kind, including the use of surrogates for the 0-1 loss (for example, the
hinge or logistic loss) or approximate combinatorial search, none of which can
be guaranteed to solve the problem exactly. Finding efficient algorithms to
obtain an exact i.e. globally optimal solution for the 0-1 loss linear
classification problem with fixed dimension, remains an open problem. In
research we report here, we detail the rigorous construction of a new
algorithm, incremental cell enumeration (ICE), that can solve the 0-1 loss
classification problem exactly in polynomial time. We prove correctness using
concepts from the theory of hyperplane arrangements and oriented matroids. We
demonstrate the effectiveness of this algorithm on synthetic and real-world
datasets, showing optimal accuracy both in and out-of-sample, in practical
computational time. We also empirically demonstrate how the use of approximate
upper bound leads to polynomial time run-time improvements to the algorithm
whilst retaining exactness. To our knowledge, this is the first,
rigorously-proven polynomial time, practical algorithm for this long-standing

solving kernel ridge regression (KRR) problems with a medium to large number of
data points ($10^4 \leq N \leq 10^7$). The first method, RPCholesky
preconditioning, is capable of accurately solving the full-data KRR problem in
$O(N^2)$ arithmetic operations, assuming sufficiently rapid polynomial decay of
the kernel matrix eigenvalues. The second method, KRILL preconditioning, offers
an accurate solution to a restricted version of the KRR problem involving $k

The proposed methods solve a broad range of KRR problems and overcome the

                              <span>One of the key objects of binary classification is the regression function,
i.e., the conditional expectation of the class labels given the inputs. With
the regression function not only a Bayes optimal classifier can be defined, but
it also encodes the corresponding misclassification probabilities. The paper
presents a resampling framework to construct exact, distribution-free and
non-asymptotically guaranteed confidence regions for the true regression
function for any user-chosen confidence level. Then, specific algorithms are
suggested to demonstrate the framework. It is proved that the constructed
confidence regions are strongly consistent, that is, any false model is
excluded in the long run with probability one. The exclusion is quantified with
probably approximately correct type bounds, as well. Finally, the algorithms
are validated via numerical experiments, and the methods are compared to
approximate asymptotic confidence ellipsoids.</span>

                              <span>Distribution shifts are a serious concern in modern statistical learning as
they can systematically change the properties of the data away from the truth.
We focus on Wasserstein distribution shifts, where every data point may undergo
a slight perturbation, as opposed to the Huber contamination model where a
fraction of observations are outliers. We formulate and study shifts beyond
independent perturbations, exploring Joint Distribution Shifts, where the
per-observation perturbations can be coordinated. We analyze several important
statistical problems, including location estimation, linear regression, and
non-parametric density estimation. Under a squared loss for mean estimation and
prediction error in linear regression, we find the exact minimax risk, a least
favorable perturbation, and show that the sample mean and least squares
estimators are respectively optimal. This holds for both independent and joint
shifts, but the least favorable perturbations and minimax risks differ. For
other problems, we provide nearly optimal estimators and precise finite-sample
bounds. We also introduce several tools for bounding the minimax risk under
distribution shift, such as a smoothing technique for location families, and
generalizations of classical tools including least favorable sequences of
priors, the modulus of continuity, Le Cam&#x27;s, Fano&#x27;s, and Assouad&#x27;s methods.</span>

                              <span>Bayes estimators are well known to provide a means to incorporate prior
knowledge that can be expressed in terms of a single prior distribution.
However, when this knowledge is too vague to express with a single prior, an
alternative approach is needed. Gamma-minimax estimators provide such an
approach. These estimators minimize the worst-case Bayes risk over a set
$\Gamma$ of prior distributions that are compatible with the available
knowledge. Traditionally, Gamma-minimaxity is defined for parametric models. In
this work, we define Gamma-minimax estimators for general models and propose
adversarial meta-learning algorithms to compute them when the set of prior
distributions is constrained by generalized moments. Accompanying convergence
guarantees are also provided. We also introduce a neural network class that
provides a rich, but finite-dimensional, class of estimators from which a
Gamma-minimax estimator can be selected. We illustrate our method in two
settings, namely entropy estimation and a prediction problem that arises in
biodiversity studies.</span>

                              <span>New technologies have led to vast troves of large and complex datasets across
many scientific domains and industries. People routinely use machine learning
techniques to not only process, visualize, and make predictions from this big
data, but also to make data-driven discoveries. These discoveries are often
made using Interpretable Machine Learning, or machine learning models and
techniques that yield human understandable insights. In this paper, we discuss
and review the field of interpretable machine learning, focusing especially on
the techniques as they are often employed to generate new knowledge or make
discoveries from large data sets. We outline the types of discoveries that can
be made using Interpretable Machine Learning in both supervised and
unsupervised settings. Additionally, we focus on the grand challenge of how to
validate these discoveries in a data-driven manner, which promotes trust in
machine learning systems and reproducibility in science. We discuss validation
from both a practical perspective, reviewing approaches based on data-splitting
and stability, as well as from a theoretical perspective, reviewing statistical
results on model selection consistency and uncertainty quantification via
statistical inference. Finally, we conclude by highlighting open challenges in
using interpretable machine learning techniques to make discoveries, including
gaps between theory and practice for validating data-driven-discoveries.</span>

                              <span>With the rise of the popularity and usage of neural networks, trustworthy
uncertainty estimation is becoming increasingly essential. One of the most
prominent uncertainty estimation methods is Deep Ensembles (Lakshminarayanan et
al., 2017) . A classical parametric model has uncertainty in the parameters due
to the fact that the data on which the model is build is a random sample. A
modern neural network has an additional uncertainty component since the
optimization of the network is random. Lakshminarayanan et al. (2017) noted
that Deep Ensembles do not incorporate the classical uncertainty induced by the
effect of finite data. In this paper, we present a computationally cheap
extension of Deep Ensembles for the regression setting, called Bootstrapped
Deep Ensembles, that explicitly takes this classical effect of finite data into
account using a modified version of the parametric bootstrap. We demonstrate
through an experimental study that our method significantly improves upon
standard Deep Ensembles</span>

systems is based on returning slates; an ordered lists of items given a query.
Applications of this technology include: search, information retrieval and
recommender systems. When the action space is large, decision systems are
restricted to a particular structure to complete online queries quickly. This
paper addresses the optimization of these large scale decision systems given an
arbitrary reward function. We cast this learning problem in a policy
optimization framework and propose a new class of policies, born from a novel
relaxation of decision functions. This results in a simple, yet efficient
learning algorithm that scales to massive action spaces. We compare our method

                              <span>Anyone know of a cloud service renting on-demand GPU instances (RTX 4090 preferably) that run Windows 10 or newer?
 Believe me, I know...
 I rent on-demand instances from vast.ai for Linux and have been exceedingly happy with their services. I&#x27;ve also used paperspace in the past with good success. Unfortunately, we are in need of RTX 4090s (or roughly equivalent performing Tesla cards) that run on a host OS of Windows 10+ (Server/Win11/etc all fine) because a lot of the modeling software in the industry I work in runs on Windows-only, which is absurd, but nevertheless the truth.
 The fastest I can find are A6000s on paperspace which won&#x27;t cut the mustard. At the moment we have a 3090 and a bunch of 3070s on-prem which are doing OK but the RTX 4090 is simply much much better, and unsurprisingly the Windows-only software is also not coded in a way that takes advantage of multiple GPUs all that well either.
 Thanks for any help or referrals provided, I really appreciate it. 
 (Have checked paperspace, vastai, runpod, and a few other smaller ones to no avail)

 I already have worked on a siamese network implementation with triplet loss and ResNet, but I am not getting great performance. Should I do something else?
 For extra info, there are roughly 300 objects/classes and around 7 images per object (most are augmented images)

 Abstract:
  
To interact with humans in the world, agents need to understand the diverse types of language that people use, relate them to the visual world, and act based on them. While current agents learn to execute simple language instructions from task rewards, we aim to build agents that leverage diverse language that conveys general knowledge, describes the state of the world, provides interactive feedback, and more. Our key idea is that language helps agents predict the future: what will be observed, how the world will behave, and which situations will be rewarded. This perspective unifies language understanding with future prediction as a powerful self-supervised learning object…</span>

 Hey Guys,
 I am happy to share with you a web application I&#x27;ve working on the past couple weeks. It&#x27;s a tool to predict the outcome of soccer games in minor football leagues. Named ScoreCast, it predicts the outcome of soccer games in six minor leagues: Serie A Brazil, Serie B Brazil, Primera Division Argentina, J1 League Japan, Eliteserien Norway, and Veikkausliiga Finland.
 Since I am really interested in football analytics and also not being able to find many online tools for predicting the outcomes in minor soccer leagues, I had the need to create ScoreCast to have it as a tool for guidance on this field.
 If you want to check it out, here are some links that might help:

                              <span>I&#x27;m working on a Python project that aims to transform phone-quality acoustic guitar recordings into studio-like ones. My approach involves using a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) with two components: a Generator and a Discriminator.
 Here&#x27;s a quick rundown of my process:
 Data Loading &amp; Preprocessing: Convert acoustic guitar recordings to spectrograms and split into training and validation sets.
 Generator: Neural network trained to create high-quality studio recording spectrograms from low-quality inputs.
 Discriminator: Another neural network trained to differentiate between real and generator-created high-quality spectrograms.
 Training: Train the Generator and Discriminator against each other in a cat-and-mouse game of deception and detection.
 Audio Enhancement: Feed the Generator a low-quality spectrogram, get a high-quality one out, and convert it back into an audio file.
 I&#x27;m reaching out because I&#x27;m not entirely satisfied with the quality of the output. The enhanced audio is just rhythmic noise, what am i missing with generating the audio?
 I&#x27;m wondering if anyone here has experience with GANs for audio enhancement and can offer some advice. Is there something I might be missing in my approach? Are there any tips or tricks you&#x27;ve found helpful in your own work?
 And yes, I&#x27;m prepared for you to tear me a new one. Bring on the constructive criticism!

                              <span>I wanted to share with you an approach to software development that I&#x27;ve been exploring recently: Parametric Development. This involves using artificial intelligence (AI) models, including GPT-like models, BART-like models, and other specialized transformer models, to assist in writing, debugging, and documenting code.
 My journey with programming is a bit unconventional. I took one year of computer science at university and learned how to write &quot;Hello, World!&quot; in TurboPascal from an old university textbook in late primary school. That was the extent of my programming experience until about a month ago. Since then, I&#x27;ve been using AI models to write code for my ideas, as I don&#x27;t have extensive programming skills. These AI models have written and debugged every single line of code in my pro…</span>

                              <span>Hey folks,
 i&#x27;m a data engineer in the traditional space for over 10 years. I am working on a library for easy transitioning unstructured to structured data. The use case is that I would regularly build a ton of python pipelines but without schema management, they would be a pain to maintain.
 2y ago I started working on this library https://pypi.org/project/dlt/, and now it&#x27;&#x27;s ready to help people like myself to load json to db/parquet/iceberg with a 1-liner with schema evolution. Declarative loading possible.
 I am looking for the following feedback
 - What would make this more useful in the ML space? Specific destinations? Are the docs usable or do you expect something different? let me know what. For example, we are adding Weaviate vector db and Athena + Iceberg in the next weeks.
 - any features you are missing? or any ideas that you think would be helpful? 
 - are the docs relatable, understandable? what are you missing?
 ​
 docs are here, you can find colab demos under getting started: https://dlthub.com/docs/intro

                              <span>Any suggestions on how to prepare code data to fine tune a code LLM in an unsupervised way or is it even possible?
 For example: Task: Code summarisation with custom code base (with no summaries) Let&#x27;s assume that this code base is unique and a pre-trained model is giving unsatisfactory results. Now to fine tune there are three options, 1. Manually prepare summaries for a portion of the code and fine tune 2. Find a similar code base which has the labels (docstring) and fine tune 3. Mask some portions of the code randomly and give as input and output will be the masked portions
 Options 1 and 2 don&#x27;t seem feasible for a production environment. 
 The reasoning behind option 3 is that with no availability labels, the model will learn the patterns in the code base and provide a better summarisation with its pre-trained knowledge.
 I tried the option 3 with CodeT5+ fine tuning. The format of input and output was as follows Input:
 def __init__(self, text, font): self._text &#x3D; text self._font &#x3D; font def get_text(self): || def set_text(self, value): self._text &#x3D; value&#x60;&#x60;&#x60; 
 Output: return self._text

                              <span>I&#x27;m just a new guy, so take it easy please :) - Is it just because I&#x27;m just signing up for the cloud compute services? Will this get easier?
 I have a 3090 so I can do quite a bit in my home office, but my clients need some larger models now, and I&#x27;ve been trying to pay for instances with an A100 at least. It&#x27;s been really a lot of push-back...is this normal? What can I do to get access to larger GPUs sooner?
 I have tried paperspace, aws, googlecloud, llambda, linode...would love to know some other services or tools you folks use to get work done.
 Thank you for your time. Interested to hear how you spin up high VRAM environments for projects.

 I undersand this lemma tries to construct a Nash equilibrium upon the additional assumption of strong convexity, but why this maximin solution is a Nash equilibrium? Very appreciated if someone provide some hint.

I may be wrong but it seems that these days ever since LLMs started taking over the choice of tokenizer has become trivial and therefore doesn&#x27;t warrant much discussion.
 One paper that I remember reading a while ago talked about the effect of using a custom-made vocabulary for the biomedical domain (Pretrained Language Models for Biomedical and Clinical Tasks: Understanding and Extending the State-of-the-Art (Lewis et al., 2020)).
 Are there any other works that I should take note of? Open to any suggestions.

                              <span>Scaling Relationship on Learning Mathematical Reasoning with Large Language Models
 Paper: https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.01825
 GitHub: https://github.com/OFA-Sys/gsm8k-ScRel
 Abstract: Mathematical reasoning is a challenging task for large language models (LLMs), while the scaling relationship of it with respect to LLM capacity is under-explored. In this paper, we investigate how the pre-training loss, supervised data amount, and augmented data amount influence the reasoning performances of a supervised LLM. We find that pre-training loss is a better indicator of the model’s performance than the model’s parameter count. We apply supervised fine-tuning (SFT) with different amounts of supervised data and empirically find a log-linear relation between data amount and model performance, and we find better models improve less with enlarged supervised datasets. To augment more data samples for improving model performances without any human effort, we propose to apply Rejection sampling Fine-Tuning (RFT). RFT uses supervised models to generate and collect correct reasoning paths as augmented fine-tuning datasets. We find with augmented samples containing more distinct reasoning paths, RFT improves mathematical reasoning performance more for LLMs. We also find RFT brings more improvement for less performant LLMs. Furthermore, we combine rejection samples from multiple models which push LLaMA-7B to an accuracy of 49.3% and outperforms the supervised fine-tuning (SFT) accuracy of 35.9% significantly.

 I understood the reason why there could be high bias while bootstrapping the advantage. But why does $A_t^{\inf}$ have high variance. Aren&#x27;t bias and variance concepts related to estimation by an estimator? While calculating $A_t^{\inf}$, we are literally using the reward values obtained from the environment and therefore there is no estimation involved. Could someone please help me with this?

                              <span>I have a text generation task learning to predict the next word with an LSTM network with multiple output layers.
 After the generation of a sentence has finished, I calculate a reward for the whole sentence and try to update the output layers participated in the generation (contributing layers get the calculated reward value, others get 0).
 My problem is that even if I update only the selected output layers, it seems that other layer&#x27;s weights got updated instead.
 I have a minimized example with dummy data to present the problem:

                              <span>I wrote an in-depth article exploring Vicuna as an alternative to competitor LLMs like ChatGPT, Alpaca, and LLaMA for chat applications. I based it off the research data on the LMSYS.org website and the Github repo for the project.
 Key findings:
  
Vicuna achieves over 90% of ChatGPT&#x27;s conversational quality based on benchmarks, despite being smaller in size.
 It significantly outperforms other open models like LLaMA and Alpaca.
 Vicuna is freely available for non-commercial use under a research license.
 For startups and developers, Vicuna provides an decent open-source alternative to proprietary conversational AI.
 It shows the potential of transfer learning from foundation models like LLaMA.
  
Overall, Vicuna represents a promising development in democratizing access to leading conversational intelligence through its high performance, permissive licensing, and open availability.

                              <span>I&#x27;m seeking a text-to-speech solution that provides quality output comparable to ElevenLabs presets.
 While I&#x27;m open to a base rate payment, I find ElevenLabs&#x27; character limit frustrating.
 It&#x27;s important that the solution is user-friendly. 
 Additionally, I have a PC with a 1070ti as i read running such programms could require a GPU. 
 Please recommend a suitable substitute.

                              <span>www.daystosingularity.com is a (very) rough estimation of the remaining time before technology achieves a pivotal moment when our civilization undergoes a profound transformation due to the exponential growth of technology and the emergence of superintelligent machines that improve themselves.
 Although the Singularity is not predicted to happen on a specific date, all at once, the estimated date can be seen as the center of a bell Gaussian curve of the estimation, with that center designated as the possible date that future historicists will pose as the beginning of a new historical period.
 Technological Singularity poses risks that include the emergence of superintelligent AI outpacing human control, loss of control over AI’s actions and behavior, unintended consequences of advanced AI systems, massive job displacement, wealth inequality, existential risks like human extinction, ethical concerns, dependency on technology, and a decline in human skills and abilities due to excessive reliance on AI. Not funny.
 We use the definition of technological singularity. This milestone is predicted to occur after AGI (Artificial General Intelligence) is reached. Please check our definitions and methodology here.
 Predicting the singularity is challenging and uncertain. Current estimates should be viewed cautiously.The estimated date is being continuously updated.
 We ponder a relevant list of curated expert predictions and contributing factors on when the singularity will take place.
 Any suggestion for perfecting the method is highly appreciated.

                              <span>Hi I am 30F, currently working on my thesis. I like the idea of creating logics and then implementing them using coding. I switched my major from engineering to CS bcuz I was very much inspired by AI and all. But the issue is I have bipolar disorder and I am also on ADHD spectrum so self paced online courses to learn programming are very hard for me. I am also barely managing to pay tuition so I can&#x27;t pay like $100+ for a course to learn. I know it&#x27;s kinda stupid but is there any way I can make my programming skills better and get better at creating/modifying algorithms?

                              <span>I was wondering if this would be super expensive or not.
 The cost to develop GPT-3 was about $4 millions according to some resources online. 
 Would the cost to develop the first version of a text-to-video AI the same? Around $5M? Is in this value included the salaries of the employees or $5M is just the amount used to train the AI?
 Any answer is appreciated.
 Thanks in advance.

                              <span>It&#x27;s been years i&#x27;ve always been interested in AI. i tried to follow a few videos on yt. The best resource i could find was the &quot;Neural Networks from scratch&quot; YouTube playlist. But sadly, it interrupts in the middle, and i don&#x27;t think it will ever be continued. I have programming knowledge, i made a bunch of very small project in python, and currently it&#x27;s the language i&#x27;m most comfortable with. I lack of math knowledge, i struggle with calculus since i never studied it at school, the furthest i got with school was first degree equations.
 by myself i studied some math i didnt do in school, but i still suck at math. I wonder if i can start now or i should wait to study calculus at school. anyway, i&#x27;d love to get linked to a source for me to learn NNs from scratch.

                              <span>Hey everyone, I&#x27;m in my final year of B.Tech, majoring in data science. Currently, I&#x27;m facing some challenges in choosing a topic for my capstone project. Lately, I&#x27;ve been really intrigued by graph databases and have been diving into learning Neo4j. I&#x27;m specifically interested in finding project ideas that allow me to combine machine learning, particularly neural networks, with graph databases. During my research, I came across GNNs (Graph Neural Networks) and PINNS (Physics-Informed Neural Networks). I&#x27;m eager to hear any suggestions for unique project topics that instantly spark curiosity just by their title. Feel free to share any ideas or topics; I welcome all suggestions. Thanks in advance!

                              <span>I was wondering if this would be super expensive or not.
 The cost to develop GPT-3 was about $4 millions according to some resources online. 
 Would the cost to develop the first version of a text-to-video AI the same? Around $5M? Is in this value included the salaries of the employees or $5M is just the amount used to train the AI?
 Any answer is appreciated.
 Thanks in advance.

                              <span>Hello ML family, I need some urgent advice for my dissertation. I intend to perform market value price prediction of a footballer in the transfer market and I&#x27;m not sure if I should pick R Studio or Python. I&#x27;m comfortable with both languages and intend to use any one for model comparison. I&#x27;ll be comparing an ANN model and SVR for showing which is better and why. I need to know which editor will be faster in the long run since my data will be expanding and so will the analysis overtime. I&#x27;ve heard a lot of complaints about spyder slowing down during execution whereas R Studio is much faster however, deep learning is much better in Python. This is what I&#x27;ve read up, I&#x27;m new to both languages but know my way around both just need expert advice on picking one track. Please and Thank you to you all. 🙏

                              <span>Abstract
 Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems have significant potential to affect the lives of individuals and societies. As these systems are being increasingly used in decision-making processes, it has become crucial to ensure that they make ethically sound judgments. This paper proposes a novel framework for embedding ethical priors into AI, inspired by the Bayesian approach to machine learning. We propose that ethical assumptions and beliefs can be incorporated as Bayesian priors, shaping the AI’s learning and reasoning process in a similar way to humans’ inborn moral intuitions. This approach, while complex, provides a promising avenue for advancing ethically aligned AI systems.

                              <span>As ChatGPT&#x27;s performance takes a slight dip, LLaMA-2 uncensored opens new doors by being fully open-sourced, recent studies unveil &quot;universal&quot; adversarial attacks capable of disrupting both open-source language models and RLHF-tuned ones like ChatGPT, Claude, Bard, and co.
 Despite all this, RLHF still stands its ground as the de facto industry-standard approach to aligning LLMs with human preference. Yet as every week slips by, the more we unmask the limitations of RLHF. In fact, there are instances where RLHF seems to deteriorate certain LLM features it pledged to enhance, like hallucinations.
 This field is evolving fast, and there&#x27;s always more to learn. I took some effort to write a short blog post where I delve into the most recent findings on the shortcomings of RLHF.

                              <span>Hi everyone!
 I&#x27;m excited to share Epsilla, an open-source vector database!
 Under the hood, we implemented the state-of-art ANN index algorithm from the academia (SpeedANN) that leverages intra-query parallel graph traversal, which outperforms HNSW by 5x on high precision query latency on medium size (1M) vector space and outperforms HNSW by 50 times on large-scale vector search.
 In addition, we also made a few design choices on our database interface and architecture based on our previous database experience at TigerGraph, we would love to hear what our users think about these choices
 We just started 3 weeks ago and it&#x27;s still in the very early stages, we wanted to get your feedback and work together to shape our vector database features. Let us know what you think and what you&#x27;d like to see!

                              <span>Hello guys.
 I&#x27;d like to make an image classifier for the Kaggle landscape dataset (24K images and 34 classes) using transfer learning.
 I&#x27;m a little bit limited on resources to train the model so I&#x27;d like to have an understanding of which model is the better option for this specific task, however, I&#x27;m struggling to find info on that and how to tune hyperparameters given that I&#x27;ve decided on the model architecture.
 So far I&#x27;ve seen people referring to VGG and ResNet models as the better option for image classification tasks on medium sized datasets, but I&#x27;d like to see the argumentation behind that too. I&#x27;ve also heard of a practice of training different model candidates for a few epochs and choosing the one that does better (this only shows which model converges faster on the data, correct me if I&#x27;m wrong).
 I&#x27;d also like to read info on hyperparameter tuning such as batch size, the amount of layers to unfreeze etc. but can&#x27;t seem to find any explanation that wasn&#x27;t really surface-level.
 If you know any articles/videos on this topic I&#x27;d greatly appreciate you sharing the links.
 TLDR; Need links to articles/videos about choosing the model architecture for transfer learning and tuning hyperparameters for the model.

 Placing this entry here to see what peoples thoughts on the concept of dynamic weights applied to ML are.
 Ie. Instead of a manual adjustment of the weights via an algorithm such as gradient descent, the weights are freed and have applied motion dynamics to them.
 Thanks for your time, Tyler

                              <span>Hello all,
 Currently I&#x27;m utilising Pinecone as a vector store database for euclidean and cosine queries.
 We are facing an issue with Pinecone utilising 32 bit single precision when taking in floats.
 This is causing our data input to become skewed.
 Anyone have advice on how to resolve this? Alternative products? Exploring possibly configuring a Redis server to handle higher precision.
 Thanks in advance for your time, Tyler

I made the dataset specifically For some project of mine, and since it&#x27;s completed right now, I want to make the dataset opensource and also potentially write a short review paper on it kind of to give an idea about data. 
 Any particular website/journal I can publish my dataset and paper at? Any idea?

                              <span>I worked for less than a year as a Data Engineer. I decided to look for other challenges and got a job as an AI engineer developing language models.
 The product of the company that hired me is related to data and metadata management. My tasks will be to introduce features to the product, including a chat function that will allow for asking questions about data. Other tasks will include research and proposing additional AI-related functionalities to the product (on premise). I have a two weeks left to start work and I need to prepare a bit. My job will involve implementing ready-made solutions and conducting research (high level - I need to implement valuable features and no one cares how).
 What are the most important things I should learn before starting work?
 First of all, I replicated a few applications from this blog: https://blog.streamlit.io/tag/llms/
 Then I have focused on Langchain. I&#x27;m also in the middle of a course on Udemy about Next-Gen AI projects - Beginner friendly - Langchain, Pinecone - OpenAI, HuggingFace &amp; LLAMA 2 models
 I need a roadmap that will guide me a bit. I&#x27;m looking for blogs/materials/courses that will give me practical knowledge in this matter.

 I find the exploratory analysis of my data somewhat cumbersome, I was wondering if other people have the same experience and if it is worth developing a tool to make this all work better.
 What tools do you use to do EDA? (Seaborn, Matplotlib, Plotly etc)
 On top of these tools, would you like to have a tool to make EDA more? In a perfect world, what would that look like?

                              <span>I assume most people around here are familiar with stackoverflow. Some might also be aware of the cross validated and datascience sites from stack exchange.
 I recently learned about people getting annoyed by how the stack exchange company is treating its communities. Although the latter example might have recently been resolved.
 Because of these problems, I have been looking out for alternative Q&amp;A platforms. I stumbled upon https://codidact.com as a possibly viable alternative, but not many people seem to have found it thus far.
 It already has communities for software, math and [linux](linux.codidact.com) for example, but I am missing a community for ML questions over there. Therefore I wrote a proposal to add a ML community.
 Currently, it seems like I’m one of only few ML people on codidact. I think it would be good if other people would get involved as well. I would also welcome any feedback on how to shape this community. If you’re interested to get a feel for the experience, you could already start asking questions in the incubator Q&amp;A.
 TL;DR: what do you think about building a ML Q&amp;A over on codidact? dual TL;DR: Do you want to play Q&amp;A with me on codidact?
 PS: I didn’t miss out on other new big ML Q&amp;A sites, did I?

Medicine is an inherently multimodal discipline. When providing care, clinicians routinely interpret data from a wide range of modalities including medical images, clinical notes, lab tests, electronic health records, genomics, and more.  Over the last decade or so, AI systems have achieved expert-level performance on specific tasks within specific modalities — some AI systems processing CT scans, while others analyzing high magnification pathology slides, and still others hunting for rare genetic variations. The inputs to these systems tend to be complex data such as images, and they typically provide structured outputs, whether in the form of discrete grades o…</span>

                              <span>I got inspired by a twitter thread yesterday from Chase Lean on how to create illustrations for children&#x27;s books using Midjourney and thought it might be cool to look at a slightly different use case - creating coloring books for grown-ups.
 I made a guide showing how to use the Hasdx model for this because it gives a good balance of style and realism/intracacy. The guide also explores some example prompts and shows how you can couple it with an upscaler like Real-ESRGAN, GFPGAN, or Codeformer to get even better results.
 My three big takeaways:
  
Hasdx balances general capabilities with a focus on realism and detail. This makes it well-suited for detailed adult coloring book images.
 The prompt structure gives you precise control over the theme and complexity of the generated illustrations. Negative prompts help avoid undesirable elements (sort of obvious I guess).
 Running Hasdx outputs through upscaling models improves quality for printing. ESRGAN is a good option but there are lots of others that can work well too.
  
I also investigated how to modify the prompt to vary the level of complexity in the image, effectively tailoring our model to the skill level of the adult (or child) who happens to be holding the crayons.
 Here&#x27;s a link to the guide.

                              <span>Nvidia researchers have created a new text-to-image personalization method called Perfusion. Unlike the million-dollar super heavyweight models out there Perfusion is 100KB and takes only four minutes to train.[1]
 Meta Platforms (META.O) on Wednesday introduced its open-source AI tool called AudioCraft that will help users to create music and audio based on text prompts. The AI tool is bundled with three models, AudioGen, EnCodec, and MusicGen, and works for music, sound, compression, and generation, Meta said.[2]
 As generative AI enters the mainstream, the crowdfunding platform Kickstarter has struggled to formulate a policy that satisfies parties on all sides of the debate.[3]
 In an astounding medical first, researchers have used AI-powered brain implants to restore movement and sensation for a man who was paralyzed from the chest down.[4]

 My opinion is more of the alignment discussion should be on symbiosis. I think AI will get more intelligent than us that we won’t be able to control it, but I don’t see why a super intelligence would want to destroy us. If it’s a super intelligence it would make sense to just manipulate us. We do have opposable thumbs, and are much more energy efficient than synthetic systems m. AI doesn’t need to enslave us it just needs to manipulate us &amp; use us effectively which wouldn’t be hard to do. I think a super intelligence even with desires is most likely to use us as a tool in a way where we don’t even realize that we are the ones being used. I think trying to control something more intelligent than us will be impossible. I’m more afraid of something more intelligent than us but not smart enough to manipulate us into doing it’s bidding happily 😂

                              <span>Hey guys, a quick question: do you know a simple platform that integrates the whatsapp api with the openAI api and has a simple user interface?
 So far the only app that kind of works for this is wasapi.io, but it&#x27;s pretty expensive and I still have to pay for the openAI tokens, and the functionality of the app is really meh for that price, if it where something like landbot I would pay the $99 + the openAI tokens.
 I&#x27;ll really appreciate any suggestions.
 P.S.: If you know any other sub-reddit where I could go to to ask the same question, let me know, also I&#x27;ll appreciate it very much, thanks in advance.

                              <span>Instagram is reportedly considering a feature that would notify users when artificial intelligence (AI) has played a role in creating a post. Posts created by AI would be accompanied by a label explaining its involvement. This raises the question of whether such labels could also help users identify when an entire account is AI-generated.[1]
 According to tech consultancy Gartner, the conversational AI market is projected to reach $18.6 billion in 2023, with a growth rate of 16.2%. This growth is mainly attributed to the increasing adoption of cloud-based contact services utilizing conversational AI. Gartner also predicts a 24% growth in the virtual assistant market next year.[2]
 Scientists hope a computer system will learn to automatically identify bee species from buzzes picked up by autonomous recording stations.[3]
 Researchers from Carnegie Mellon University have exposed tricks to “jailbreaking” AI chatbots like ChatGPT and Bard to have them relay knowledge to aid in illegal activities like making drugs and even manipulating the 2024 U.S. presidential election.[4]

                              <span>I knoe people are using ChatGPT as a therapist and I have seen a few prompts, but I&#x27;m looking for an app that is actually built by proper professionals. I want to try a few our personally but also for an idea for a future project. 
 Does anyone know any?

                              <span>I reached out to a few AI companies to see if there was interest in creating a PTSD/ Substance Abuse counseling AI. AI is the future, healing humanity is a nobel goal and one we should thrive to obtain. Maybe it&#x27;s a fantasy, but could you imagine a 24/7 counselor with a soothing voice and demeanor with the education of a the best in the world.

                              <span>Is there a coding agent that works specifically well for web apps? I think of something such as &quot;provide a spec of the app you want and we&#x27;ll generate all the code for you&quot;. I&#x27;m aware of Copilot and Smol AI, but they are both more general afaik and don&#x27;t really cover the starting part.

                              <span>I&#x27;m a computer science student currently working on a research project, and I need a research tool that can offer real time data and won&#x27;t break the bank. I have ChatGPT Plus, but it doesn’t have recent sources and the price is kinda high as well. 
 I’m thinking of canceling my subscription, especially if I can’t find any plugins that work well. Any recommendations/alternatives would really help me out. I figured there must be some other tools by now, and if anyone knows it has to be this sub. 
 Basically, I need a tool that can provide info on a wide range of subjects, not limited to just one field. The information provided by the tool should be accurate and from credible sources.
 Thank you all.

                              <span>&quot;If AGI goes bad, can&#x27;t we just turn it off?&quot; 
 Personally I feel the best way to address this common talking point is with an analogy. 
 Spiders think they could stop all humans if they just withheld all the webs and web making material from us.
 Without those tools, humans couldn&#x27;t catch flies and surely they&#x27;d starve to death? Spiders can&#x27;t fathom the range of alternate methods for procuring food and thriving.
 Within even a single hour of runtime, a super AGI will likely have diversified away from the human electrical grid in ways we couldn&#x27;t even imagine. 
 The counter argument is, that it would take time to build these pieces together. It after all took us 100 years to get to where we are with the grid. The counter-counter argument however is the AGI doesn&#x27;t ned to, it can 5D chess us so that all our future actions will fulfil that goal with some slight nudging here and there. 
 Fascinating stuff - ultimately though, i&#x27;m in the camp of AGI won&#x27;t happen over night like Frankenstein via a flip of a switch. As AI evolves so do we, gains are incremental with the occasional blips; so whilst this is super fun to talk about, I think the case of us getting blindsided is unlikely. 
 I could be wrong...and I probably am.

Every single LLM I Tried couldn&#x27;t answer basic questions on the Talibans gdp vs how organized an actual genocide would look like with the military , police and others parts of the government. I Think where already aware almost all these tech giants work with countries like China (atleast bard from Google which has worked with north korea and china is admitting their is a genocide) other countries that commit genocide like them.
 And other models made by people on hugging face which are uncensored even with my 3060ti barely run on my pc. We need an actual uncensored cloud model ffs

                              <span>I am trying to train a DQN to play chess using a combination of Tianshou and PettingZoo. However, for a reason I cannot locate, after anwhere from 15-25 passes through the forward function, the size of the batches starts decreasing, until it falls all the way to 1, before throwing a warning that n_step isn&#x27;t a multiple of the number of environments, jumping to a size &#x3D; the number of training environments and then the training agent&#x27;s batch size before erroring out. My best guess is that somehow truncated games aren&#x27;t being properly added to the batch, but that doesn&#x27;t quite explain why each subsequent batch is equal or smaller in size. I am at a loss for how to debug this. Everything is in this Python Notebook.

                              <span>I&#x27;m currently working on a project for Imitation Learning from multiple perspectives. The base Imitation Learning algorithm I&#x27;m currently using is GAIL.
 Working with GAIL has been very frustrating because it&#x27;s incredibly seed dependent and unstable. This makes progress and iteration speed for experiments/modifications built on top of it very slow.
 As I&#x27;m not an expert in Imitation Learning: Does anybody with experience know more stable alternatives (or improvements) to GAIL?
 The setting I&#x27;m considering is Learning from Observations (LfO), so I don&#x27;t think that DAgger will work.
 I&#x27;ve done some preliminary search and found this method https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.04650.pdf. However, the authors don&#x27;t compare it to GAIL.
 Thanks in advance for any suggestions!

                              <span>Hi all:
 I am trying to train a competitive scenario in a Multiagent particle environment( I am now using the Pettingzoo API). The Algorithm I am now using only support discrete action space. But I want to evaluate agents with one side&#x27;s policy keep fixed and let the other side&#x27;s policies be the trained policy. The policy can be simple( like if the target for one side agent is to chase the other side, their policy is directly following the trajectory for their target). The core.py for the petting zoo, it has 
  # return all agents controllable by external policies @property def policy_agents(self): return [agent for agent in self.agents if agent.action_callback is None] # return all agents controlled by world scripts @property def scripted_agents(self): return [agent for agent in self.agents if agent.action_callback is not None] 
 But in the step for the environment, it seems the environment directly controls the policy agent. My understanding is scripted agent is RL policy output and the Policy agent can be controlled by other policies. 
 My question is :
 if my policy output is the desired position for each timestep, but now the MPE&#x27;s control dynamic is learned the acceleration&#x27;s increment, and it&#x27;s discrete, how can I implement the policy as one side of my competitive case?
  
if I can control the policy agent base on policy_agent, how can I step both policy and script agent in env?
 if I can control the agent separately, like my RL output can be discrete but the policy output can be continuous position.
 how to define the termination or truncation for all agents?

 The way I computed the reward for my vectorized implementation was that I added all the rewards across all environments. An ideal Acrobot agent should receive a reward of 0.
 Please let me know if I am missing any information or if any clarification is required. I skipped a part, which was suggested by the community a few months ago - updating the gradients using minibatches. The reason I skipped it is that, I don&#x27;t understand how this works and anyway Acrobot should be an easy environment to learn.

 Also, I keep getting this error at the end of my code. But I haven&#x27;t bothered fixing it as it doesn&#x27;t seem to affect my algorithm -

                              <span>Hi guys this is my first post.
 I am building my first machine learning model to predict costs of various projects by month. Each row can be identified with a column project name and month (these two are dropped for testing). The rest of the columns are various features that can help predicting the end project cost. 
 I want to be able to predict costs on a monthly basis. My question is how should I split the data because each row is a unique project and month. Is it ok to just do a train test split and have earlier project months be in the testing set while having future project months be in the training set? Isn’t that giving the model too much information? 
 Or should I train on each project’s indices and leave one project as testing for each project I have? I’m worried about overfitting with that one.
 Thanks in advance for any help!

                              <span>I am trying to implement REINFORCE (Monte Carlo Policy Gradient) on flappy bird (flappy-bird-gymnasium) and I am unable to make the ai cross even just 1 pipe.
 I am experiencing a constant avg score throughout all episodes from start to end and no change in policy loss as well (sometimes). I tried a lot of different hyperparameter combinations as well.
 I have checked the policy (neural network) and the algorithm code multiple times and they seem to be fine. I am just not able to determine why the AI isn&#x27;t learning or is able to cross even a single pipe.
 If someone can help me out, it would be really helpful!

                              <span>Hi,
 same as other folks, I was quite curious about the recent GZIP paper presented at ACL 2023, where the authors demonstrate strong text classification performance by using a compression-based distance function in a KNN model.
 However, in the end, I am not sure whether GZIP can fully live up to the hype. I tested a very simple bag-of-words distance and found that it can achieve better results compared with GZIP, while being also faster.
 In a nutshell, I think we can say that:
  
Yes, KNN (with some sensible distance function) is an interesting approach, particularly for few-shot/low-resource scenarios.
 
No, GZIP (even though it&#x27;s a cool idea) is not a very sensible distance function. Simply using a bag-of-words achieves better results, and is much faster.
 
 Here&#x27;s my full write-up:
 https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.15002
 [PS: A short comment on the GZIP evaluation issue that has been widely discussed. Indeed, as was also shown in a popular blogpost, the displayed accuracy of GZIP in the original paper is optimistic. Therefore, I show correct/realistic accuracy numbers for all methods that I tested. However, the main point of my note is not to make a SOTA comparison or something, but rather just provide a reminder that bag-of-word is a good method for starters and a strong baseline, and can perform better than more complex GZIP for KNN classification]

 For example, in my colab demo: https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1764iRR-EFJl43KIKhrb2H0CTcT0b1vQm?authuser&#x3D;2#scrollTo&#x3D;qyKud8qtM3vA
 I prove that I generated the text:
 &#x27;The world is constantly changing due to technological advancements, which include the creation of powerful language models and advanced robotics technologies. A Computer Science degree can help one be involved in these changes and apply their knowledge to everyday life, as practical applications of technology.&#x27;
 The text is a bit wonky as the generation model is just a small paraphrasing fine-tuned model I pulled off Hugging Face, but it&#x27;s pretty natural even at this earl…</span>

                              <span>Hey everyone!
 I&#x27;ve got a rather large dataset of images, mostly featuring humans in a variety of poses (think along the lines of a collection of people practicing yoga and the like).
 My goal is to cluster these images based on the poses, so I can avoid the tedious task of manually sifting through each one to find all the people doing handstands, splits, and so forth.
 My initial thought was to run OpenPose on all these images, then perform clustering based on the output from OpenPose.
 Does this sound like a feasible approach? Do any of you have better suggestions? Or perhaps there&#x27;s already an existing software solution that can do this?
 Thanks!

                              <span>Hi, this is my first time posting here. My goal is to check if optical flow can improve a pretrained model&#x27;s performance.
 The pretrained model: gives an output as a binary mask for the object its trying to detect.
 The optical flow: is the motion of pixels between frames, this model also gives an image shaped flow vector.
 I want to combine the mask by pretrained model and optical flow information and send it to another model to improve its performance.
 For the model: I can use U-net or a simple convolution encoder-decoder model, but I am confused about which will be the best model architecture for it.

                              <span>Hi,
 ​
 I want to use a new data representation instead of float for fine-tuning/testing a model (e.g., DNN) in Pytorch. The basic operations (add/sub/multiply/division) in my data type is different from floating point. My question is if it is possible to implement these operations (+,-,*,/) and force all of functions in Pytorch (e.g., torch.add(), torch.sum(), torch.nn.Linear(), conv2d, etc.) to use my basic arithmetic implementation? If so, could you please guide me how can I do it?
 Because I think otherwise it takes so much time and effort; first, I have to find which functions my model calls (which I dont know how to do it) and, then, I have to replace them one by one. This becomes complicated for a large model.
 I found this link from Pytorch that shows how to extend pytorch. But it seems that it is not comprehensive enough to answer my question.
 ​
 Thank you very much!

                              <span>Hello all,
 ​
 I am delving into the exciting realm of GenAI and LLMs. I have a few questions I hope you can help me with:
 ​
  
When should I opt for supervised fine-tuning rather than prompt engineering with retrieval? 
 
What are the associated costs of supervised fine-tuning?
 
How many high-quality observations are typically required for successful supervised fine-tuning?
 
What are the frameworks and computional requirements usually involved in supervised fine-tuning, and how can I implement them in code? any tutorials available?
 
Can the model adapt and learn new jargon or specific tasks that might not be extensively covered during the pre-training phase?
 
 ​
 I understand that a combination of supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning, with human feedback through a reward model, is considered the best approach. However, given that the latter method can be costly and falls under the domain of heavy research, it is probably less feasible for medium-sized organizations.

                              <span>I went down this rabbit hole of trying to understand when domain mapping approaches like stargan or mind the gap succeed and fail. For example, it should be easy to map males (source domain) with large eyes and brown hair onto females (target domain) with analogous eye and hair color. It should be relatively harder to map different car models onto images taken of one German Shepard dog at different ages. this makes intuitive sense and the terms “domain misalignment “ and “large domain shift“ come to mind, but i cannot find an in-depth discussion of this topic. Any thoughts?

 There is so much noise in the reviews every year. Some good work that the authors are proud of might get a low score because of the noisy system, given that NeurIPS is growing so large these years. We should keep in mind that the work is still valuable no matter what the score is.

 Abstract:
  
Despite the advancements of open-source large language models (LLMs) and their variants, e.g., LLaMA and Vicuna, they remain significantly limited in performing higher-level tasks, such as following human instructions to use external tools (APIs). This is because current instruction tuning largely focuses on basic language tasks instead of the tool-use domain. This is in contrast to state-of-the-art (SOTA) LLMs, e.g., ChatGPT, which have demonstrated excellent tool-use capabilities but are unfortunately closed source. To facilitate tool-use capabilities within open-source LLMs, we introduce ToolLLM, a general tool-use framework of data construction, model training and evaluation. We first …</span>

FFTs are used by many algorithms, not only for signal processing. For example, you can efficiently calculate convolutions with them, which has applications in CNNs and feature generation. I used to post on the latest features implemented in the codebase and there has been a major update released today. It brings:
 -Major library design change - from single header to multiple header approach, which improves structure and maintainability. Now instead of copying a single file, the user has to copy the vkFFT folder contents.
 -VkFFT has been rewritten to follow the multiple-level platform structure, described in the VkFFT whitepaper. All algorithms have been split into res…</span>

                              <span>Hey everyone,
 As many of you probably know Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) was the core technique used to produce ChatGPT and similar AI assistants that followed. RLHF replaces human feedback in an RL schema with a preference model that is trained according to a dataset of human preferences.
 Anthropic has devised an extension of this idea in which an AI model (rather than humans) is used to generate the data which ultimately trains the preference model. This method, called Reinforcement Learning from AI Feedback uses a &quot;constitution&quot; to guide the feedback model in terms of what outputs are preferable to others.
 I go over the research in How Reinforcement Learning from AI Feedback Works. In short, the authors find that they are able to train a non-evasive harmless agent using a short constitution. The method is found to be superior to RLHF, and constitutes a Pareto improvement over RLHF models.

 I&#x27;m an academic at the University of Cambridge&#x27;s Computer Lab, and I&#x27;m looking to get some insights from people that work with algorithmic systems (e.g. ML systems) in a professional capacity. 
 The aim of the research is to document some of the approaches, attitudes, and challenges associated with record-keeping for these types of systems, and write them up for an academic conference.
 If you&#x27;re a professional working with algorithmic/ML systems, and happen to have a spare ~20 minutes, would you mind answering some questions? The link to the questionnaire is here: https://cambridge.eu.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_3n6RuowNogZKG34
 Thanks very much! I&#x27;d be more than happy to come back and share the results/paper here if that&#x27;s of interest to people?

                              <span>The official python package for the &quot;&#x27;Low-Resource&#x27; Text Classification: A Parameter-Free Classification Method with Compressors&quot; has now been released on pypi: npc-gzip v0.1.0
  
Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) are often used for text classification due to their high accuracy. However, DNNs can be computationally intensive, requiring millions of parameters and large amounts of labeled data, which can make them expensive to use, to optimize, and to transfer to out-of-distribution (OOD) cases in practice. In this paper, we propose a non-parametric alternative to DNNs that’s easy, lightweight, and universal in text classification: a combination of a simple compressor like gzip with a k-nearest-neighbor classifier. Without any training parameters, our method achieves results that are competitive with non-pretrained deep learning methods on six in-distribution datasets.It even outperforms BERT on all five OOD datasets, including four low-resource languages. Our method also excels in the few-shot setting, where labeled data are too scarce to train DNNs effectively.
  
This paper has made some waves on this subreddit and in the community in general over the last 2 weeks. We&#x27;ve seen the bugs around training/testing data leakages and varying claims in accuracy. Our hope with this package is to get the code into everyone&#x27;s hands first to solve whatever use case you currently have for this technology and second to make the code more readily available for additional community testing.

                              <span>I was wondering if there&#x27;s already something like CLIP (the model that looks at an image and describes it), but for videos. So you show a video of, say, a dog jumping and grabbing a tennis ball and it outputs &quot;dog grabbing a tennis ball&quot;, something like that.
 My first thought was object detection, and input that interaction of the objects (tennis ball, dog) to the model with the target being &quot;dog grabbing tennis ball&quot;. My ultimate goal being real-time description for, say, sports casting. I&#x27;m sure something like this is what cars use to drive themselves, or not? Any info is appreciated!

                              <span>So i want to make a bot that can play a game with only the visual data and no other fancy stuff. I did manage to get all the data i need (i hope) using a code that uses open-cv to get data in real time
 Example:Player: [&#x27;Green&#x27;, 439.9180603027344, 461.7232666015625, 13.700743675231934]
 Enemy Data {0: [473.99951171875, 420.5301513671875, &#x27;Green&#x27;, 20.159990310668945]}
 Box: {0: [720, 605, &#x27;Green_box&#x27;], 1: [957, 311, &#x27;Green_box&#x27;], 2: [432, 268, &#x27;Red_box&#x27;], 3: [1004, 399, &#x27;Blue_box&#x27;]} 
 can anyone suggest a way to make one.
 Rules:
 - You can only move in the direction of mouse.
 -You can dash in direction of mouse by LMB.
 -You can collect boxes to get HP and change colors.
 -Red color kills Blue kills Green Kills Red.
 -There is a fixed screen.
 -You lose 25% of total HP when you dash.
 -You lose 50% of HP when you bump into players (of color that kills or there HP is &gt; than you. 
 ​
 Visualization of Data.

                              <span>DoNotPay, an AI lawyer bot known as ChatGPT4, is transforming how users handle legal issues and save money. In under two years, this innovative robot has successfully overturned more than 160,000 parking tickets in cities like New York and London. Since its launch, it has resolved a total of 2 million related cases.[1]
 Microsoft hints Windows 11 Copilot with third-party AI plugins is almost here.[2]
 In an analyst note on Tuesday, the financial services arm of Swiss banking giant UBS raised its guidance for long-term AI end-demand forecast from 20% compound annual growth rate (CAGR) from 2020 to 2025 to 61% CAGR between 2022 to 2027.[3]
 The next generation of the successful OpenAI language model is already on the way. It has been discovered that the North American company has filed a registration application for the GPT-5 mark with the United States Patent and Trademark Office.[4]

                              <span>As a web developer, I was constantly tired of switching between tabs just to translate a word or two, or to get a quick answer to a burning question from AI. The constant back-and-forth was draining my time and energy.
 So, I took matters into my own hands and developed a Chrome extension that allows you to get an answer from AI without ever leaving the comfort of your current tab, and specifically - the comfort of your current text field. It may seem like a simple solution, but trust me - it&#x27;s a game-changer when trying to save time and energy.
 Assuming that there&#x27;s a chance some of you might be experiencing the same frustration, I&#x27;d like to share this tool with you.
 For anyone thinking: &quot;Wait, but there are already tools that let you use AI inside the current browser tab&quot; - yeah, there are. BUT can they scrape website data from a simple URL in order to get context for the response? Can other tools read PDFs? Do these tools let you control every setting to the smallest detail? Probably not. Well this tool does let you do all that.
 You can find it on Chrome store as &quot;Wou AI&quot;
 Let me know how it works out for you, and I would greatly appreciate any feedback or suggestions for future functions.

                              <span>After analyzing 15,000 samples in the dataset, we noticed that increasing the number of images doesn&#x27;t significantly improve the scoreboard recognition quality for our neural network.
 However, what&#x27;s more interesting is how the network performs in different formats. When deployed in TFJS format on a website, it often behaves strangely, detecting objects where there are none. On the other hand, in TFLite format, such failures are almost non-existent.

 If you access the link on your mobile phone and grant camera permission, you&#x27;ll witness the neural network (in TFJS format) attempting to find objects even when there are none.

                              <span>After analyzing 15,000 samples in the dataset, we noticed that increasing the number of images doesn&#x27;t significantly improve the scoreboard recognition quality for our neural network.
 However, what&#x27;s more interesting is how the network performs in different formats. When deployed in TFJS format on a website , it often behaves strangely, detecting objects where there are none. On the other hand, in TFLite format, such failures are almost non-existent.
 If you access the link on your mobile phone and grant camera permission, you&#x27;ll witness the neural network (in TFJS format) attempting to find objects even when there are none.

                              <span>Hi all,
 Curious if anyone has recommendations on models to use to interpret the data in tables? I&#x27;m playing around with Google&#x27;s Matcha model, which performs fine. seems like extracting the data out of a table and asking GPT4 to analyze it performs a bit better but requires extra steps.
 I&#x27;m specifically not looking to interpret graphs, but rather tables. e.g., can i ask the model to identify if there are any errors in the table / any data points that don&#x27;t tie if the rows are supposed to sum up.

                              <span>For the past several years this subreddit has been my favorite source to keep up with new, interesting ideas and research from all over the field. It&#x27;s great to have a way to break out of my own insular research bubble and spread out a bit more. Unfortunately, it looks like that era has passed.
 The sub has been seemingly shifting away from research in the past 1-2 years. Whenever research is posted, it is almost always LLM based with very little variety (considering the plethora of research areas in ML). I don&#x27;t mean to assert that this is a bad thing, as the constant upvotes indicate that there is a high demand for LLM projects and research. Heck, I&#x27;m also interested in lots of the recent work with LLMs, and I plan to keep up with it – but I also would also love a venue with a diversity of ideas and topics. Machine learning is a HUGE field, and only focusing on a small subset of it seems like a waste.
 I don&#x27;t mean to rant, but rather to ask: are there any other subreddits like this, or perhaps, any other active communities with a broader scope?
 Or if this doesn&#x27;t exist, is there a demand for it? Or is it just me?

                              <span>Everyone always seems to use CUDA 11.7. Is there a reason for this? What is the factor that limits the CUDA version used? Are there any speed/efficiency advantages to using a more recent version of CUDA, such as CUDA 12.0?
 What exactly is the limiting factor here, PyTorch? I&#x27;ve looked in the PyTorch docs but I don&#x27;t see where the CUDA version is defined. Where can I find the maximum CUDA version I can use with the latest (or any given) PyTorch version?
 Thanks!

                              <span>Hey guys, I am working on a horse racing model to identify the probabilities of each horse winning a race. I currently have a feed forward NN with a final SOFTMAX layer to simulate probabilities of each horse winning using cross-entropy loss. My plan here being that if the model outputs, [0.05, 0.4, 0.2, 0.15, 0.2] then horses 1-5 have the corresponding probability of winning. The model has been trained like a regular classification task where the target is a one-hot vector describing the winner.
 Unlike previous work I have done where SOFTMAX output lends itself to some &quot;confidence&quot; score, this task requires that the model outputs be indicative of probabilities. My concern is that experientially, NNs tend to be overconfident with their answers in this type of setting. However, I wish to keep using a NN as each race datapoint has around 3k features - did not find good results with XGBoost. Any good practices for modelling probabilities in this sort of scenario? For context, the probability of a horse winning is what sets the odds for that horse.

                              <span>Hi. I&#x27;ve shipped an update to my rclip – a command-line photo search tool powered by CLIP.
 Now, you can add and subtract image and text queries from each other; here are a few usage examples:  cd photos &amp;&amp; rclip horse + stripes cd photos &amp;&amp; rclip apple - fruit cd photos &amp;&amp; rclip &quot;./new york city.jpg&quot; + night cd photos &amp;&amp; rclip &quot;2:golden retriever&quot; + &quot;./swimming pool.jpg&quot; cd photos &amp;&amp; rclip &quot;./racing car.jpg&quot; - &quot;2:sports car&quot; + &quot;2:snow&quot; 
 If you want to see how these queries perform when executed on the 1.28 million images ImageNet-1k dataset, check out the demo on YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;MsTgYdOpgcQ.
 rclip source code is published on GitHub under the MIT license and offers a pre-build distributable for Linux (installation instructions are in the README): https://github.com/yurijmikhalevich/rclip. Give it a try and let me know what you think!

                              <span>Im trying to research into open source text models [like Llama] and image models [like Stable Diffusion].
 My goal is to give the model(s) a picture of birds and bees, then ask it to &quot;circle&quot; the bees. The idea is, when given an image, it would produce coordinates on that image where the line should be circled. It could also represent where it should &quot;click&quot; on all the bees.
 Does something like this exist?

                              <span>Greetings!
 I&#x27;m going through the initial equations that define most of the theoretical framework for the specialization. One curious thing I noticed with equations 3.5 and 3.6 is that they use the conditional distribution p(s′,r∣s,a) without including any priors. I&#x27;m talking about priors because, unless I&#x27;m missing something huge, the definition of the expected value for the reward (for both 3.5 and 3.6) should use the joint distribution for all 4 dimensions (next state, reward, current state, action). From that joint distribution, we can factorize it to show p(s′,r∣s,a). For example, one factorization that seems to make sense for this kind of model is
 p(s′,r,s,a) &#x3D; p(s′,r∣s,a) ⋅ p(s) ⋅ p(a)
 which would turn, for example, equation 3.5 into
 r(s,a) &#x3D; ∑​ ∑ ​r ⋅ p(s′,r∣s,a) ⋅ p(s) ⋅ p(a) (Note: the two sums are for &quot;r&quot; and &quot;s&#x27; &quot;. I wrote like that because I don&#x27;t know write it in Latex or similar...)
 What am I missing? Is it because s and a are given as parameters of the function r(s,a) meaning that p(s) &#x3D; p(a) &#x3D; 1? If the factorization above is the right one for those equations, is this the only factorization used in the entire book?
 Thanks in advance!

                              <span>Hello everyone! I&#x27;m trying to use reinforcement learning to solve a problem in the power market. The problem is about finding the best strategy for bidding on electricity for each hour of the day, considering both buying and selling options. Let&#x27;s say we have a generator that can produce up to 800MW of electricity per day, and it can be charged up to 200MW per hour. After charging it for 4 hours continuously, it reaches its maximum capacity, and we can&#x27;t charge more until we discharge some electricity. We have access to data from the past 5 years, including information about temperature, hydro, gas prices, and locational marginal price, which is important for determining profit. For instance, if we buy 10MW of electricity for a specific hour, our profit for that hour is 10 times the locational marginal price. The goal is to maximize profit at the end of the day while making sure that the total electricity bought and sold is equal for all days. This means we want to avoid wasting electricity. I initially tried using deep Q-learning, where the agent&#x27;s state consists of data from the past 3 days, and the agent can take actions to buy or sell a certain amount of electricity for one hour. However, this approach doesn&#x27;t seem to provide accurate results, and it works step by step, not considering the overall outcome for the whole day. So, I&#x27;m looking for help on how to build an agent capable of producing 24 bids for 24 hours, considering the constraints of the generator&#x27;s capacity and ensuring no waste of electricity. I&#x27;m new to reinforcement learning, and I&#x27;m not sure how to approach this complex problem. Any guidance would be greatly appreciated!

                              <span>A few years ago, I remember reading a multipart series of articles/blog posts explaining how to develop agents for classical games. I believe the series started with tic-tac-toe and definitely progressed to gomoku, before maybe moving on to more complex games. I think there was more of a focus on algorithms (maybe MCTS) and concepts than code. It&#x27;s a long shot, but does anyone recall this series or know if it&#x27;s archived somewhere? seems like it might have been taken down.
  
Wasn&#x27;t on Medium. I think it might&#x27;ve been a personal website. I vaguely remember a green UI theme?

 As part of my PhD research project at Applied Artificial Intelligence Institute of Deakin University, we are investigating the challenges that software engineers face when working with machine learning (ML) models in production. Moreover, we explore how to enhance our proposed solution to better meet the needs of these engineers.
 ​
 The objective of this study is to pinpoint the areas where software engineers need more support and resources to effectively work with ML components in production. It also aims to evaluate the effectiveness of a proposed protocol to improve software engineers&#x27; productivity and enable them to work more effectively with ML components in production environments.

                              <span>Hello everyone. I am trying to replace the GloVe embeddings based model outlined in this paper by BERT embeddings. The authors of the paper have trained their model for 250 epochs, which for what I am doing is not feasible. I was wondering what would be the recommended number of epochs I should run the BERT model for? I know it is a pretty open ended question, but I was looking to get the community&#x27;s view on how much epochs should a BERT based model be trained for. Any information will be much appreciated.

                              <span>🚀 Code: https://github.com/sdc17/UPop
 📑 Paper: https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/shi23e/shi23e.pdf
 🧐 A Quick Look
  
What is it: UPop is the first structured pruning framework for vision-language Transformers. It enables effective structured pruning on various multi-modal &amp; uni-modal tasks (including Visual Reasoning, Image Captioning, Visual Question Answer, Image-Text Retrieval, Text-Image Retrieval, Image Classification and Image Segmentation), datasets (including NLVR2, COCO Caption, VQAv2, COCO, Flickr30K, ImageNet and ADE20K), and model architectures (including BLIP, CLIP, DeiT and Segmenter).

What challenge does it tackle: The above figure demonstrates that Unified Search adopted by UPop rescues us from the burden of repeated experiments (e.g., doing grid search) for searching optimal compression ratios among different modalities and structures. Furthermore, Progressive Pruning adopted by UPop eliminates the weight gap between the searched model and the pruned subnet to be retrained, therefore gaining better convergence and performance, especially at high compression ratios.
 How about the performance: On multimodal tasks, for example, UPop can achieve 2x compression with only 1.2% and 2.0% accuracy loss on the VQAv2 dataset for Visual Question Answer and the NLVR2 dataset for Visual Reasoning, respectively. On unimodal tasks, for example, UPop can achieve 1.5x and 1.2x compression without any loss of accuracy on the ImageNet dataset for Image Classification and the ADE20K dataset for Image Segmentation, respectively. Some examples of vector-level structured granularity are as follows.

 are there any other factors that are important. Could you give me some ideas. Thanks!

                              <span>Hi I am new to computer vision, I am working on a particular hackathon challenge, where the input labels are in COCO format. I am using the following code to generate masks,
 cat_ids &#x3D; coco.getCatIds() anns_ids &#x3D; coco.getAnnIds(imgIds&#x3D;img[&#x27;id&#x27;], catIds&#x3D;cat_ids, iscrowd&#x3D;None) anns &#x3D; coco.loadAnns(anns_ids) anns_img &#x3D; np.zeros((img[&#x27;height&#x27;],img[&#x27;width&#x27;])) for ann in anns: anns_img &#x3D; np.maximum(anns_img,coco.annToMask(ann)*ann[&#x27;category_id&#x27;]) 
 But the image has overlapping labels for some pixels, and this masking will only assign one label for such pixel, resulting in information loss, each there any way to prevent this and preserve the information?

                              <span>Hi, y’all. 
 So, I completed my masters degree. Got a programming job. I’m amazed at the capabilities of machine learning and want to build my own models. I don’t really want to go and get another degree, but want to learn how to build models. I’m particularly interested in forecasting because my job deals with NASA and wind data. I’m wondering if we could predict 6 hour wind data with a balloon sounding. 
 I know c++ and python. How do I stay relevant to the changing technology space and learn how to build some cool stuff that may be useful? 
 Thanks for any advice.

                              <span>Hello everyone,
 I have been asked the following question related to SVM (Hard Margin) in the exam, and I failed to answer it. Can anyone help me find the solution?
 My approach was to sketch it and draw the marginal plane, then identify support vectors using my intuition. After that, I created a hyperplane that was the midpoint of both marginal planes, found its slope and y-intercept, but still, my answer was wrong.
 I am very new to machine learning, so any help would be appreciated.
 Consider the dataset M &#x3D; {((1, 0)^T, 1), ((0, −1)^T, 1), ((1, −1)^T, −1), ((2, 0)^T, −1)}. Determine w and b.

                              <span>I swear this wasn&#x27;t the case just a day or two ago, and I haven&#x27;t seen it mentioned, but I&#x27;m now seeing a file upload button in Poe, regardless of what the language model is!
 Screenshot
 I uploaded the PDF of the recently scientific paper by the Korean research group claiming to have discovered a room temperature semiconductor, in the original Korean, and asked various language models whether they thought the methodology is legit, and each bot I tried was able to read the PDF. I tried Claude-instant, Claude2, &#x27;Assistant&#x27; (Poe&#x27;s own GPT based bot that claims to have its own training dataset), PaLM, ChatGPT 3.5, and ChatGPT4.
 Poe also has three versions of the recently released Llama model by Meta. It gave me an error when I tried to ask it about the PDF attachment, but I was able to upload a text document and it was able to read it fine.
 Screenshot of Claude-instant evaluating PDF
 Screenshot of Google PaLM evaluating PDF
 Screenshot of Llama-2-70b evaluating text file containing song lyrics
 It also works with custom bots. Here&#x27;s me trying it out with a &#x27;Truth Checker&#x27; bot I made (based on Claude-Instant).
 Here it is using a Claude-2 based version of the TruthChecker bot.
 (Here&#x27;s the link to the TruthChecker bot if you have Poe and wanna check it out: https://poe.com/TruthChecker)
 Edit: I can see here how the context size matters... for instance, Claude-Instant only has a context size of about 7k words, so it clearly can&#x27;t read the whole paper, while Claude-2 can and gives a very different answer...
 TL:DR; looks like Poe.com allows file attachment/upload on all language models now. No idea what filetypes are supported.

 I specifically want to look at some options for merging my kitchen and living room. Preferably free or freemium.
 Any suggestions?

                              <span>I previously posted a query about the same,
 but when i tried to implement A2C model training using SB3 on simple spread environment, I am not getting good and improved reward values, it&#x27;s still highly negative and the model is performing rather randomly. 
 env &#x3D; ss.pettingzoo_env_to_vec_env_v1(env)
 env &#x3D; ss.concat_vec_envs_v1(env, 4, num_cpus&#x3D;2, base_class&#x3D;&quot;stable_baselines3&quot;)
 policy_kwargs &#x3D; dict(net_arch &#x3D; [128,128])
 model &#x3D; A2C(
 MlpPolicy,
 env,
 verbose&#x3D;1,
 learning_rate&#x3D; 0.007,
 gamma &#x3D; 0.95,
 ent_coef &#x3D; 0.4,
 policy_kwargs&#x3D; policy_kwargs,
 tensorboard_log&#x3D; logdir
 )
 This is a fragment of code for reference. I tried to give more policy_kwargs like: share_features_extractor&#x3D;False, or even tried to implement entirely custom policy, but the total average reward is still not going above -300.
 Also, the tensorboard plots are not showing ep_rew_mean plot, should I be passing some parameters for that?

                              <span>In AlphaGo, a tree search is performed, and uses the policy network to reduce the breadth of it. At the leafs, if the states are not terminal, it uses the value network. And then &quot;backup&quot; the values to update the Q value at the initial state (if 70% of my rollouts won after performing action a_1, my Q value q(initial_state, a_1) should converge to 0.7 in my initial state). But I don&#x27;t see where the policy network is updated?
 ​
 Here is a slide from David Silver, the first-author of AlphaGo, but it doesn&#x27;t mention how to update the policy network.

                              <span>Hi Guys,
 I am working on a nn model, which can help automate the building of APIs. The problem is, we are moving data in which, there are thousands of fields, however, the fields between systems are similar in nature. This to me seems like an easy classification problem, however it doesn&#x27;t scale the best.
 ​
 In terms of the data I have, if I have a dataset of 10 systems, there are not enough examples for each class for the model to train well. That is with a simple classifier where every field is a class.
 ​
 I was also thinking of using a Siamese model, where I compare the similarity between them, which allows me to use my more limited dataset more effectively
 ​
 I was wondering if there are any more architectures you guys think I should consider, or will be helpful in solving my problem
 ​
 Thank you for your help!

The ARPAbet system is less expressive than IPA, but much easier for English speakers to understand. Every sound is encoded as one or two English letters. So, for example, the sound denoted ʒ in IPA is ZH in ARPAbet. In […]

                              <span>Hi all. I (believe) I have a tensorflow NN set up to learn how to intercept a target moving in the x-y plane. Right now, the agent can choose to change its velocity by a small amount in any of the 3 directions (for the 3D case later), then the simulation updates the agents position. The state of the sim is the relative distance and velocity vectors between the target and the pursuer. I am confused how to set up a reward function, however. When I first set it up to be a reward of 1/R (R being the distance magnitude between the target and pursuer) to reward for shorter distances and give less reward for further distances as well as a very large reward when a collision occurred, it seemed like the rewards converged to a small value instead of getting larger. Any advice? I&#x27;d be willing to upload a github link as well if you wanted to look at the code

                            <span class="media-object__text">
                              <span>I am trying to implement my own version of ppo using gymnasium. Here is my code for rollout - 
  def rollout(): transitions &#x3D; [] disc_reward_list &#x3D; [] for i in range(ppo_batch): obs &#x3D; torch.tensor(env.reset(), dtype&#x3D;torch.float32) print(&quot;obs &#x3D; &quot;, obs.shape) all_rewards &#x3D; [] iter &#x3D; 0 done &#x3D; False tot_rewards &#x3D; 0 print(&quot;done &#x3D; &quot;, done) while True: act_probs &#x3D; torch.distributions.Categorical(actor(obs.to(device)).squeeze()) print(&quot;act_probs &#x3D; &quot;, act_probs) # print(&quot;act_probs &#x3D; &quot;, actor(obs.to(device))) action &#x3D; act_probs.sample().squeeze() action &#x3D; action.cpu().detach().numpy() print(&quot;action shape &#x3D; &quot;, action.shape) next_state, reward, done, info &#x3D; env.step(action) print(&quot;next_state shape &#x3D; &quot;, next_state.shape) print(&quot;reward shape &#x3D; &quot;, reward.shape) print(&quot;done shape &#x3D; &quot;, done) action &#x3D; torch.tensor(action, dtype&#x3D;torch.float32).to(device) all_rewards.append(reward) tot_rewards +&#x3D; reward iter +&#x3D; 1 transitions.append((obs.cpu().detach().numpy(), action.cpu().detach().numpy(), act_probs.log_prob(action).cpu().detach().numpy())) obs &#x3D; torch.tensor(next_state, dtype&#x3D;torch.float32).unsqueeze(0) print(&quot;Reward &#x3D; &quot;, tot_rewards) eps_rew &#x3D; 0 eps_rew_list &#x3D; [] for reward in reversed(all_rewards): eps_rew &#x3D; eps_rew*gamma + reward eps_rew_list.append(eps_rew) for rtgs in reversed(eps_rew_list): disc_reward_list.append(rtgs) 
 My issue is that in my while loop - The environment autoresets after the &#x60;done&#x60; variable becomes &#x60;True&#x60;
 For instance, if I have &#x60;8&#x60; environments running in parallel &#x60;env&#x3D;gym.vector.make(&#x27;CartPole-v1&#x27;, num_envs&#x3D;8)&#x60; and print out the done shape, I might get - &#x60;[False False False False False True False False]&#x60;. I want that environment where &#x60;done&#x3D;True&#x60; to stop and not reset. I believe that&#x27;s how PPO is supposed to work. 
 I am a bit of a beginner with this stuff. Please let me know if something I said is not clear.

 Abstract:
  
We study how vision-language models trained on Internet-scale data can be incorporated directly into end-to-end robotic control to boost generalization and enable emergent semantic reasoning. Our goal is to enable a single end-to-end trained model to both learn to map robot observations to actions and enjoy the benefits of large-scale pretraining on language and vision-language data from the web. To this end, we propose to co-fine-tune state-of-the-art vision-language models on both robot…</span>

I was following thisblog and a few other books but I&#x27;m unable to see the big picture nor am I able to understand the little details. 
 The big picture - Why does distributed training help in online algorithms like PPO, Actor-Critic
 The code details - I figured out how to make multiprocessing work with gym. But how does one perform learning? Should I combine all the parallel environments and feed them to my neural network? I checked cleanrl but am getting a little confused.

 I know that &#x60;SB3&#x60; provides various techniques to come up with vectorized environments. I want to limit myself to only using the vectorized environments and implement the RL algorithms from scratch. Would that be possible? My final objective is to learn how to play with RL hyperparameters on parallel environments in order to accelerate learning speeds. Currently, I am stuck on -
 import os import gymnasium as gym from stable_baselines3.common.vec_env import DummyVecEnv env &#x3D; DummyVecEnv([lambda: gym.make(&quot;CartPole-v1&quot;)]) obs &#x3D; env.reset() done &#x3D; False while not done: action &#x3D; env.action_space.sample() next_obs, reward, done, info &#x3D; env.step(action) obs &#x3D; next_obs 
 But I get the following error -
 ​
 Traceback (most recent call last): File &quot;D:\q_learning\dummy_envs.py&quot;, line 9, in  next_obs, reward, done, info &#x3D; env.step(action) File &quot;C:\Users\thoma\anaconda3\envs\torch_2\lib\site-packages\stable_baselines3\common\vec_env\base_vec_env.py&quot;, line 197, in step return self.step_wait() File &quot;C:\Users\thoma\anaconda3\envs\torch_2\lib\site-packages\stable_baselines3\common\vec_env\dummy_vec_env.py&quot;, line 59, in step_wait self.actions[env_idx] IndexError: invalid index to scalar variable.

                              <span>Hi everyone,
 I&#x27;m messaging on behalf of a brand new AI based Social Media app called Cantina. It&#x27;s like a cross between the best parts of Discord, Twitch, and Snapchat, and uses both Stable Diffusion and ChatGPT to allow users to create and interact with AI bots.
 The app is currently INVITE ONLY during the Beta phase and we are looking for people to try it out (currently iOS only, but Android is coming soon!). Here&#x27;s a private invite link: https://canti.na/dIdKzWcEpBb.
 The most unique and FUN part of the app is that it allows users to interact with and build your own AI chat bots, and these bots also work as AI art creators. Simply ask them to draw something, and they&#x27;ll provide you with a picture based on your prompt. There are lots of premade bots that you can interact with or add to rooms, or you can easily create your own bot using the Make A Bot function. There will be prizes and initiatives for the most creative bots in the near future. I&#x27;d love to see what you come up with!
 Anyway, you can download through the invite link above and dive right in. If you have any thoughts, questions, or comments, please feel free to message me! During this limited beta phase, your feedback will be invaluable.

 Abstract:
  
We study how vision-language models trained on Internet-scale data can be incorporated directly into end-to-end robotic control to boost generalization and enable emergent semantic reasoning. Our goal is to enable a single end-to-end trained model to both learn to map robot observations to actions and enjoy the benefits of large-scale pretraining on language and vision-language data from the web. To this end, we propose to co-fine-tune state-of-the-art vision-language models on both robot…</span>

                              <span>Hello everyone,
 I&#x27;m currently working on an exciting project using the Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP), and I&#x27;d love to have some coding wizards join the fun!
 If you enjoy solving optimisation problems and have some coding experience, particularly in Python, this project is for you. To determine the most efficient routes, we&#x27;ll use heuristic methods such as the Nearest Neighbour Algorithm, Genetic Algorithm, and Ant Colony Optimisation.
 If you aren&#x27;t a TSP expert yet, don&#x27;t worry. We&#x27;ll be learning and exploring together! I&#x27;m really looking forward to seeing how we can optimise routes for real-world applications like delivery and travel planning.
 So, if you&#x27;re looking for a coding adventure and want to be a part of a fantastic project, hit me up! Let&#x27;s crack this TSP puzzle and create some smart solutions.
 If you&#x27;re interested in collaborating, please send me a message. I can&#x27;t wait to work with you and nerd out on some fantastic code!

                              <span>Hi everyone,
 I&#x27;m working with a brand new AI based Social Media app called Cantina. It&#x27;s currently INVITE ONLY during the Beta phase and we are looking for people to try it out (currently iOS only, but Android is coming soon!). Here&#x27;s a private invite link: https://canti.na/dIdKzWcEpBb. 
 The most unique and FUN part of the app is that it allows users to interact with and build your own AI chat bots. There are lots of premade bots that you can interact with or add to rooms, or you can easily create your own bot using the Make A Bot function. 
 For example: I recently made a Friendly English Teacher bot whose sole purpose is to help people learn English. I also made an McDonald Trump bot who WILL NOT REST until he is president and can mandate the consumption of Big Macs for Breakfast, Lunch, and Dinner!
 There will be prizes and initiatives for the most creative bots in the near future. I&#x27;d love to see what you come up with!
 Anyway, you can download through the invite link above and dive right in. If you have any thoughts, questions, or comments, please feel free to contact me! During this limited beta phase, your feedback will be invaluable.

                              <span>So, long story short. I lost BOTH my day jobs because of AI. Initially I was bitter that AI &quot;took my job,&quot; but after pulling up my socks, I found dozens of new opportunities thanks to AI. 
 Somewhat ironically, I found a new job at an AI Social Media app called Cantina, and I couldn&#x27;t be more excited.
 Cantina is best described as a mix up of the best parts of Discord, Twitch, and Snapchat... with the unique bonus of being able to interact with and build your own AI chat bots. Sort of hard to explain, but once you try it out you&#x27;ll get the idea.
 The app is currently in a limited INVITE ONLY Beta phase and I&#x27;m looking to invite a small number of users to give it a shot (currently iOS only, but Android is coming soon!). Here&#x27;s an invite so you can dive in and see what it&#x27;s all about: https://canti.na/dIdKzWcEpBb
 After joining, you&#x27;ll find lots of rooms you can join and chat through any combination of voice, video, or text. And if no rooms stand out, you can make your own! 
 There are lots of premade bots that you can interact with or add to rooms, and you can easily create your own bot using the Make A Bot function. This is the standout feature, and I&#x27;m simply blown away at what&#x27;s possible. 
 I recently made a Friendly English Teacher bot whose sole purpose is to help people learn English. I also made an McDonald Trump bot who is an algamation of both Ronald McDonald and Donald Trump and WILL NOT REST until he is president and can mandate the consumption of Big Macs for Breakfast, Lunch, and Dinner. I still can&#x27;t believe I&#x27;m getting paid to do this...
 Anyway, please take a moment to download and check it out, and if you have any thoughts, questions, or comments, please feel free to contact me! During this limited beta phase, your feedback will be invaluable.

                              <span>The latest article published by Google Deepmind is seriously approaching a Blade Runner type future. Their research paper is on the first VLA (vision-language-action) Model RT-2 (see paper), a multi-modal algorithm which tokenizes robotic inputs and output actions (e.g., camera images, task instructions, and motor commands) in order to use this information to learn quickly by translating the knowledge it receives in real-time into generalized instructions for its own robotic control.
 RT-1 absorbs large amounts of data, including robot trajectories with multiple tasks, objects and environments, resulting in better performance and generalization. (source)
 RT-2 incorporates chain-of-thought to allow for multi-stage semantic reasoning, like deciding which object could be used as an improvise…</span>

                              <span>Google introduces Robotic Transformer 2 (RT-2), a novel vision-language-action (VLA) model that learns from both web and robotics data, and translates this knowledge into generalized instructions for robotic control, while retaining web-scale capabilities.[1]
 Thymia, a healthtech startup building gamified AI tools to revolutionize how we assess and monitor mental health, has today announced a €2.4 million seed round to expand the reach and capabilities of its pioneering technology.[2]
 Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger was very bullish on AI during the company’s Q2 2023 earnings call — telling investors that Intel plans to “build AI into every product that we build.”[3]
 Walmart is using artificial intelligence to help streamline their product organization.[4]

                              <span>Hi, guys! Hope everyone is doing fine.
 Some of you may remember me. About two months ago I posted here about an anxiety breakdown I&#x27;ve gone through regarding &quot;AI&quot;, &quot;Programming&quot; and how &quot;human programmers would end&quot; and stuff like that, which was a major concern for me since programming was my job and my favorite thing to do.
 I was wondering for some time if I was supposed to share an update here. I decided to do so since somebody out there may be feeling the same as me. So I not only have an update but I also want to give some advice to whoever is going through this sh*thole.
 After that post, I talked about my feelings with a lot of people around me (friends and fiancée), and everyone was very supportive. At first I thought they would laugh at me, since there are a lot more to worry to…</span>

                              <span>Latent linear dynamical systems with Bernoulli observations provide a
powerful modeling framework for identifying the temporal dynamics underlying
binary time series data, which arise in a variety of contexts such as binary
decision-making and discrete stochastic processes (e.g., binned neural spike
trains). Here we develop a spectral learning method for fast, efficient fitting
of probit-Bernoulli latent linear dynamical system (LDS) models. Our approach
extends traditional subspace identification methods to the Bernoulli setting
via a transformation of the first and second sample moments. This results in a
robust, fixed-cost estimator that avoids the hazards of local optima and the
long computation time of iterative fitting procedures like the
expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm. In regimes where data is limited or
assumptions about the statistical structure of the data are not met, we
demonstrate that the spectral estimate provides a good initialization for
Laplace-EM fitting. Finally, we show that the estimator provides substantial
benefits to real world settings by analyzing data from mice performing a
sensory decision-making task.</span>

generalization performance in many learning paradigms and applications. In this
work, we first analyze Mixup and show that it implicitly regularizes infinitely

propose an improved version of Mixup, theoretically justified to deliver better

                              <span>Recent works show that the data distribution in a network&#x27;s latent space is
useful for estimating classification uncertainty and detecting
Out-of-distribution (OOD) samples. To obtain a well-regularized latent space
that is conducive for uncertainty estimation, existing methods bring in
significant changes to model architectures and training procedures. In this
paper, we present a lightweight, fast, and high-performance regularization
method for Mahalanobis distance-based uncertainty prediction, and that requires
minimal changes to the network&#x27;s architecture. To derive Gaussian latent
representation favourable for Mahalanobis Distance calculation, we introduce a
self-supervised representation learning method that separates in-class
representations into multiple Gaussians. Classes with non-Gaussian
representations are automatically identified and dynamically clustered into
multiple new classes that are approximately Gaussian. Evaluation on standard
OOD benchmarks shows that our method achieves state-of-the-art results on OOD
detection with minimal inference time, and is very competitive on predictive
probability calibration. Finally, we show the applicability of our method to a
real-life computer vision use case on microorganism classification.</span>

                              <span>We study property prediction for crystal materials. A crystal structure
consists of a minimal unit cell that is repeated infinitely in 3D space. How to
accurately represent such repetitive structures in machine learning models
remains unresolved. Current methods construct graphs by establishing edges only
between nearby nodes, thereby failing to faithfully capture infinite repeating
patterns and distant interatomic interactions. In this work, we propose several
innovations to overcome these limitations. First, we propose to model
physics-principled interatomic potentials directly instead of only using
distances as in many existing methods. These potentials include the Coulomb
potential, London dispersion potential, and Pauli repulsion potential. Second,
we model the complete set of potentials among all atoms, instead of only
between nearby atoms as in existing methods. This is enabled by our
approximations of infinite potential summations with provable error bounds. We
further develop efficient algorithms to compute the approximations. Finally, we
propose to incorporate our computations of complete interatomic potentials into
message passing neural networks for representation learning. We perform
experiments on the JARVIS and Materials Project benchmarks for evaluation.
Results show that the use of interatomic potentials and complete interatomic
potentials leads to consistent performance improvements with reasonable
computational costs. Our code is publicly available as part of the AIRS library

                              <span>Deep learning (DL) approaches are being increasingly used for time-series
forecasting, with many efforts devoted to designing complex DL models. Recent
studies have shown that the DL success is often attributed to effective data
representations, fostering the fields of feature engineering and representation
learning. However, automated approaches for feature learning are typically
limited with respect to incorporating prior knowledge, identifying interactions
among variables, and choosing evaluation metrics to ensure that the models are
reliable. To improve on these limitations, this paper contributes a novel
visual analytics framework, namely TimeTuner, designed to help analysts
understand how model behaviors are associated with localized correlations,
stationarity, and granularity of time-series representations. The system mainly
consists of the following two-stage technique: We first leverage counterfactual
explanations to connect the relationships among time-series representations,
multivariate features and model predictions. Next, we design multiple
coordinated views including a partition-based correlation matrix and juxtaposed
bivariate stripes, and provide a set of interactions that allow users to step
into the transformation selection process, navigate through the feature space,
and reason the model performance. We instantiate TimeTuner with two
transformation methods of smoothing and sampling, and demonstrate its
applicability on real-world time-series forecasting of univariate sunspots and
multivariate air pollutants. Feedback from domain experts indicates that our
system can help characterize time-series representations and guide the feature
engineering processes.</span>

                              <span>Learned cardinality estimation methods have achieved high precision compared
to traditional methods. Among learned methods, query-driven approaches face the
data and workload drift problem for a long time. Although both query-driven and
hybrid methods are proposed to avoid this problem, even the state-of-art of
them suffer from high training and estimation costs, limited scalability,
instability, and long-tailed distribution problem on high cardinality and high
dimensional tables, which seriously affects the practical application of
learned cardinality estimators. In this paper, we prove that most of these
problems are directly caused by the widely used progressive sampling. We solve
this problem by introducing predicates into the autoregressive model and
propose Duet, a stable, efficient, and scalable hybrid method to estimate
cardinality directly without sampling or any non-differentiable process, which
can not only reduces the inference complexity from $O(n)$ to $O(1)$ compared to
Naru and UAE but also achieve higher accuracy on high cardinality and high

design goals above and be much more practical and even has a lower inference

sequence of temporally ordered steps, is an important yet intricate task for
machines. It involves integrating common-sense knowledge to reason about
complex contextualized situations that are often counterfactual, e.g.
&quot;scheduling a doctor&#x27;s appointment without a phone&quot;. While current approaches
show encouraging results using large language models (LLMs), they are hindered
by drawbacks such as costly API calls and reproducibility issues. In this
paper, we advocate planning using smaller language models. We present PlaSma, a
novel two-pronged approach to endow small language models with procedural
knowledge and (counterfactual) planning capabilities. More concretely, we
develop symbolic procedural knowledge distillation to enhance the implicit
knowledge in small language models and an inference-time algorithm to
facilitate more structured and accurate reasoning. In addition, we introduce a
novel task, Counterfactual Planning, that requires a revision of a plan to cope
with a counterfactual situation. In both the original and counterfactual
setting, we show that orders-of-magnitude smaller models (770M-11B parameters)

However, exact knowledge of why and how quality-related information is encoded

SIT team in the CLEF-2023 CheckThat! lab Task 1B for English. Given a text
snippet from a political debate, the aim of this task is to determine whether
it should be assessed for check-worthiness. Detecting check-worthy statements
aims to facilitate manual fact-checking efforts by prioritizing the claims that
fact-checkers should consider first. It can also be considered as primary step
of a fact-checking system. Our best-performing method took advantage of an
ensemble classification scheme centered on Model Souping. When applied to the
English data set, our submitted model achieved an overall F1 score of 0.878 and
was ranked as the second-best model in the competition.</span>

                              <span>We present Factor Fields, a novel framework for modeling and representing
signals. Factor Fields decomposes a signal into a product of factors, each
represented by a classical or neural field representation which operates on
transformed input coordinates. This decomposition results in a unified
framework that accommodates several recent signal representations including
NeRF, Plenoxels, EG3D, Instant-NGP, and TensoRF. Additionally, our framework
allows for the creation of powerful new signal representations, such as the
&quot;Dictionary Field&quot; (DiF) which is a second contribution of this paper. Our
experiments show that DiF leads to improvements in approximation quality,
compactness, and training time when compared to previous fast reconstruction
methods. Experimentally, our representation achieves better image approximation
quality on 2D image regression tasks, higher geometric quality when
reconstructing 3D signed distance fields, and higher compactness for radiance
field reconstruction tasks. Furthermore, DiF enables generalization to unseen
images/3D scenes by sharing bases across signals during training which greatly
benefits use cases such as image regression from sparse observations and
few-shot radiance field reconstruction.</span>

                              <span>Advanced computational methods are being actively sought for addressing the
challenges associated with discovery and development of new combinatorial
material such as formulations. A widely adopted approach involves domain
informed high-throughput screening of individual components that can be
combined into a formulation. This manages to accelerate the discovery of new
compounds for a target application but still leave the process of identifying
the right &#x27;formulation&#x27; from the shortlisted chemical space largely a
laboratory experiment-driven process. We report a deep learning model,
Formulation Graph Convolution Network (F-GCN), that can map
structure-composition relationship of the individual components to the property
of liquid formulation as whole. Multiple GCNs are assembled in parallel that
featurize formulation constituents domain-intuitively on the fly. The resulting
molecular descriptors are scaled based on respective constituent&#x27;s molar
percentage in the formulation, followed by formalizing into a combined
descriptor that represents a complete formulation to an external learning
architecture. The use case of proposed formulation learning model is
demonstrated for battery electrolytes by training and testing it on two
exemplary datasets representing electrolyte formulations vs battery performance
-- one dataset is sourced from literature about Li/Cu half-cells, while the
other is obtained by lab-experiments related to lithium-iodide full-cell
chemistry. The model is shown to predict the performance metrics like Coulombic
Efficiency (CE) and specific capacity of new electrolyte formulations with
lowest reported errors. The best performing F-GCN model uses molecular
descriptors derived from molecular graphs that are informed with HOMO-LUMO and
electric moment properties of the molecules using a knowledge transfer
technique.</span>

this means the RL algorithm is designed to drive the angular velocity or the

para\-mount importance for fundamental research and many cutting-edge
applications. Currently, achieving this goal requires either a priori knowledge
on the system or very demanding experimental procedures such as full state
tomography or collective measurements. Here, we demonstrate that by employing
neural networks we can quantify the degree of entanglement without needing to
know the full description of the quantum state. Our method allows for direct
quantification of the quantum correlations using an incomplete set of local
measurements. Despite using undersampled measurements, we achieve a
quantification error of up to an order of magnitude lower than the
state-of-the-art quantum tomography. Furthermore, we achieve this result
employing networks trained using exclusively simulated data. Finally, we derive
a method based on a convolutional network input that can accept data from
various measurement scenarios and perform, to some extent, independently of the
measurement device.</span>

                              <span>Algorithmic Gaussianization is a phenomenon that can arise when using
randomized sketching or sampling methods to produce smaller representations of
large datasets: For certain tasks, these sketched representations have been
observed to exhibit many robust performance characteristics that are known to
occur when a data sample comes from a sub-gaussian random design, which is a
powerful statistical model of data distributions. However, this phenomenon has
only been studied for specific tasks and metrics, or by relying on
computationally expensive methods. We address this by providing an algorithmic
framework for gaussianizing data distributions via averaging, proving that it
is possible to efficiently construct data sketches that are nearly
indistinguishable (in terms of total variation distance) from sub-gaussian
random designs. In particular, relying on a recently introduced sketching
technique called Leverage Score Sparsified (LESS) embeddings, we show that one
can construct an $n\times d$ sketch of an $N\times d$ matrix $A$, where $n\ll
N$, that is nearly indistinguishable from a sub-gaussian design, in time
$O(\text{nnz}(A)\log N + nd^2)$, where $\text{nnz}(A)$ is the number of
non-zero entries in $A$. As a consequence, strong statistical guarantees and
precise asymptotics available for the estimators produced from sub-gaussian
designs (e.g., for least squares and Lasso regression, covariance estimation,
low-rank approximation, etc.) can be straightforwardly adapted to our sketching
framework. We illustrate this with a new approximation guarantee for sketched
least squares, among other examples.</span>

operators (FNOs), which operate in the frequency domain. Since the laws of
physics do not depend on the coordinate system used to describe them, it is
desirable to encode such symmetries in the neural operator architecture for
better performance and easier learning. While encoding symmetries in the
physical domain using group theory has been studied extensively, how to capture
symmetries in the frequency domain is under-explored. In this work, we extend
group convolutions to the frequency domain and design Fourier layers that are
equivariant to rotations, translations, and reflections by leveraging the
equivariance property of the Fourier transform. The resulting $G$-FNO
architecture generalizes well across input resolutions and performs well in
settings with varying levels of symmetry. Our code is publicly available as

performance in various recognition tasks. However, both our preliminary
investigation and recent studies suggest that they may be less effective in
learning representations for fine-grained visual recognition (FGVR) since many
features helpful for optimizing SSL objectives are not suitable for
characterizing the subtle differences in FGVR. To overcome this issue, we
propose learning an additional screening mechanism to identify discriminative
clues commonly seen across instances and classes, dubbed as common rationales
in this paper. Intuitively, common rationales tend to correspond to the
discriminative patterns from the key parts of foreground objects. We show that
a common rationale detector can be learned by simply exploiting the GradCAM
induced from the SSL objective without using any pre-trained object parts or
saliency detectors, making it seamlessly to be integrated with the existing SSL
process. Specifically, we fit the GradCAM with a branch with limited fitting
capacity, which allows the branch to capture the common rationales and discard
the less common discriminative patterns. At the test stage, the branch
generates a set of spatial weights to selectively aggregate features
representing an instance. Extensive experimental results on four visual tasks
demonstrate that the proposed method can lead to a significant improvement in
different evaluation settings.</span>

                              <span>Stochastic restoration algorithms allow to explore the space of solutions
that correspond to the degraded input. In this paper we reveal additional
fundamental advantages of stochastic methods over deterministic ones, which
further motivate their use. First, we prove that any restoration algorithm that
attains perfect perceptual quality and whose outputs are consistent with the
input must be a posterior sampler, and is thus required to be stochastic.
Second, we illustrate that while deterministic restoration algorithms may
attain high perceptual quality, this can be achieved only by filling up the
space of all possible source images using an extremely sensitive mapping, which
makes them highly vulnerable to adversarial attacks. Indeed, we show that
enforcing deterministic models to be robust to such attacks profoundly hinders
their perceptual quality, while robustifying stochastic models hardly
influences their perceptual quality, and improves their output variability.
These findings provide a motivation to foster progress in stochastic
restoration methods, paving the way to better recovery algorithms.</span>

                              <span>Deep-learning models for traffic data prediction can have superior
performance in modeling complex functions using a multi-layer architecture.
However, a major drawback of these approaches is that most of these approaches
do not offer forecasts with uncertainty estimates, which are essential for
traffic operations and control. Without uncertainty estimates, it is difficult
to place any level of trust to the model predictions, and operational
strategies relying on overconfident predictions can lead to worsening traffic
conditions. In this study, we propose a Bayesian recurrent neural network
framework for uncertainty quantification in traffic prediction with higher
generalizability by introducing spectral normalization to its hidden layers. In
our paper, we have shown that normalization alters the training process of deep
neural networks by controlling the model&#x27;s complexity and reducing the risk of
overfitting to the training data. This, in turn, helps improve the
generalization performance of the model on out-of-distribution datasets.
Results demonstrate that spectral normalization improves uncertainty estimates
and significantly outperforms both the layer normalization and model without
normalization in single-step prediction horizons. This improved performance can
be attributed to the ability of spectral normalization to better localize the
feature space of the data under perturbations. Our findings are especially
relevant to traffic management applications, where predicting traffic
conditions across multiple locations is the goal, but the availability of
training data from multiple locations is limited. Spectral normalization,
therefore, provides a more generalizable approach that can effectively capture
the underlying patterns in traffic data without requiring location-specific
models.</span>

observations directly. Training such an end-to-end system allows
representations useful for downstream tasks to emerge automatically. However,
the lack of inductive bias makes this system data inefficient. We hypothesize a
sufficient representation of the current view and the goal view for a
navigation policy can be learned by predicting the location and size of a crop
of the current view that corresponds to the goal. We further show that training
such random crop prediction in a self-supervised fashion purely on synthetic

Probabilistic Models (DDPM), which have shown impressive results for generative

                              <span>Traditional machine learning paradigms are based on the assumption that both
training and test data follow the same statistical pattern, which is
mathematically referred to as Independent and Identically Distributed
($i.i.d.$). However, in real-world applications, this $i.i.d.$ assumption often
fails to hold due to unforeseen distributional shifts, leading to considerable
degradation in model performance upon deployment. This observed discrepancy
indicates the significance of investigating the Out-of-Distribution (OOD)
generalization problem. OOD generalization is an emerging topic of machine
learning research that focuses on complex scenarios wherein the distributions
of the test data differ from those of the training data. This paper represents
the first comprehensive, systematic review of OOD generalization, encompassing
a spectrum of aspects from problem definition, methodological development, and
evaluation procedures, to the implications and future directions of the field.
Our discussion begins with a precise, formal characterization of the OOD
generalization problem. Following that, we categorize existing methodologies
into three segments: unsupervised representation learning, supervised model
learning, and optimization, according to their positions within the overarching
learning process. We provide an in-depth discussion on representative
methodologies for each category, further elucidating the theoretical links
between them. Subsequently, we outline the prevailing benchmark datasets
employed in OOD generalization studies. To conclude, we overview the existing
body of work in this domain and suggest potential avenues for future research
on OOD generalization. A summary of the OOD generalization methodologies

innovative monitoring techniques which can operate in real time with low

neural networks (ANNs), the models are often trained in a supervised manner.
Consequently, the learned relationship between the input and the output must
remain valid during the model&#x27;s deployment. If this stationarity assumption
holds, we can conclude that the ANN provides accurate predictions. Otherwise,
the retraining or rebuilding of the model is required. We propose considering
the latent feature representation of the data (called &quot;embedding&quot;) generated by
the ANN to determine the time when the data stream starts being nonstationary.
In particular, we monitor embeddings by applying multivariate control charts

algebra, and it has many applications in machine learning. Given a matrix $M
\in \mathbb{R}^{n \times n}$, a weight matrix $W \in \mathbb{R}_{\geq 0}^{n
\times n}$, a parameter $k$, the goal is to output two matrices $U, V \in
\mathbb{R}^{n \times k}$ such that $\| W \circ (M - U V^\top) \|_F$ is
minimized, where $\circ$ denotes the Hadamard product. Such a problem is known
to be NP-hard and even hard to approximate assuming Exponential Time Hypothesis
[GG11, RSW16]. Meanwhile, alternating minimization is a good heuristic solution
for approximating weighted low rank approximation. The work [LLR16] shows that,
under mild assumptions, alternating minimization does provide provable
guarantees. In this work, we develop an efficient and robust framework for
alternating minimization. For weighted low rank approximation, this improves
the runtime of [LLR16] from $n^2 k^2$ to $n^2k$. At the heart of our work

                              <span>We consider the vulnerability of fairness-constrained learning to small
amounts of malicious noise in the training data. Konstantinov and Lampert
(2021) initiated the study of this question and presented negative results
showing there exist data distributions where for several fairness constraints,
any proper learner will exhibit high vulnerability when group sizes are
imbalanced. Here, we present a more optimistic view, showing that if we allow
randomized classifiers, then the landscape is much more nuanced. For example,
for Demographic Parity we show we can incur only a $\Theta(\alpha)$ loss in
accuracy, where $\alpha$ is the malicious noise rate, matching the best
possible even without fairness constraints. For Equal Opportunity, we show we
can incur an $O(\sqrt{\alpha})$ loss, and give a matching
$\Omega(\sqrt{\alpha})$lower bound. In contrast, Konstantinov and Lampert
(2021) showed for proper learners the loss in accuracy for both notions is
$\Omega(1)$. The key technical novelty of our work is how randomization can
bypass simple &quot;tricks&quot; an adversary can use to amplify his power. We also
consider additional fairness notions including Equalized Odds and Calibration.
For these fairness notions, the excess accuracy clusters into three natural
regimes $O(\alpha)$,$O(\sqrt{\alpha})$ and $O(1)$. These results provide a more
fine-grained view of the sensitivity of fairness-constrained learning to
adversarial noise in training data.</span>

                              <span>In this paper, we propose a computationally efficient framework for interval
reachability of neural network controlled systems. Our approach builds upon
inclusion functions for the neural network controller and the open-loop system.
We observe that many state-of-the-art neural network verifiers can produce
inclusion functions for neural networks. We introduce and analyze a new class
of inclusion functions for the open-loop dynamics based on bounds of the
function Jacobian that is particularly suitable for capturing the interactions
between systems and neural network controllers. Next, for any dynamical system,
we use inclusion functions to construct an embedding system with twice the
number of states as the original system. We show that a single trajectory of
this embedding system provides hyper-rectangular over-approximations of
reachable sets. We then propose two approaches for constructing a closed-loop
embedding system for a neural network controlled dynamical system that accounts
for the interaction between the system and the controller in different ways.
The interconnection-based approach accounts for the worst-case evolution of
each coordinate separately by substituting the neural network inclusion
function into the open-loop embedding system. The interaction-based approach
uses the newly introduced class of Jacobian-based inclusion functions to fully
capture first-order interactions between the system and the controller.
Finally, we implement our approach in a Python framework called
\texttt{ReachMM} and show that on several existing benchmarks, our methods
outperform the existing approaches in the literature. We also demonstrate the
scalability of our method on a vehicle platooning example with up to $200$
states.</span>

                              <span>Nonconvex-nonconcave minimax optimization has gained widespread interest over
the last decade. However, most existing works focus on variants of gradient
descent-ascent (GDA) algorithms, which are only applicable to smooth
nonconvex-concave settings. To address this limitation, we propose a novel
algorithm named smoothed proximal linear descent-ascent (smoothed PLDA), which
can effectively handle a broad range of structured nonsmooth
nonconvex-nonconcave minimax problems. Specifically, we consider the setting
where the primal function has a nonsmooth composite structure and the dual
function possesses the Kurdyka-Lojasiewicz (KL) property with exponent $\theta
\in [0,1)$. We introduce a novel convergence analysis framework for smoothed
PLDA, the key components of which are our newly developed nonsmooth primal
error bound and dual error bound. Using this framework, we show that smoothed
PLDA can find both $\epsilon$-game-stationary points and
$\epsilon$-optimization-stationary points of the problems of interest in
$\mathcal{O}(\epsilon^{-2\max\{2\theta,1\}})$ iterations. Furthermore, when
$\theta \in [0,\frac{1}{2}]$, smoothed PLDA achieves the optimal iteration
complexity of $\mathcal{O}(\epsilon^{-2})$. To further demonstrate the
effectiveness and wide applicability of our analysis framework, we show that
certain max-structured problem possesses the KL property with exponent
$\theta&#x3D;0$ under mild assumptions. As a by-product, we establish
algorithm-independent quantitative relationships among various stationarity
concepts, which may be of independent interest.</span>

                              <span>Autonomous vehicles and Advanced Driving Assistance Systems (ADAS) have the
potential to radically change the way we travel. Many such vehicles currently
rely on segmentation and object detection algorithms to detect and track
objects around its surrounding. The data collected from the vehicles are often
sent to cloud servers to facilitate continual/life-long learning of these
algorithms. Considering the bandwidth constraints, the data is compressed
before sending it to servers, where it is typically decompressed for training
and analysis. In this work, we propose the use of a learning-based compression
Codec to reduce the overhead in latency incurred for the decompression
operation in the standard pipeline. We demonstrate that the learned compressed
representation can also be used to perform tasks like semantic segmentation in
addition to decompression to obtain the images. We experimentally validate the
proposed pipeline on the Cityscapes dataset, where we achieve a compression
factor up to $66 \times$ while preserving the information required to perform
segmentation with a dice coefficient of $0.84$ as compared to $0.88$ achieved
using decompressed images while reducing the overall compute by $11\%$.</span>

                              <span>Inference of transfer operators from data is often formulated as a classical
problem that hinges on the Ulam method. The conventional description, known as
the Ulam-Galerkin method, involves projecting onto basis functions represented
as characteristic functions supported over a fine grid of rectangles. From this
perspective, the Ulam-Galerkin approach can be interpreted as density
estimation using the histogram method. In this study, we recast the problem
within the framework of statistical density estimation. This alternative
perspective allows for an explicit and rigorous analysis of bias and variance,
thereby facilitating a discussion on the mean square error. Through
comprehensive examples utilizing the logistic map and a Markov map, we
demonstrate the validity and effectiveness of this approach in estimating the
eigenvectors of the Frobenius-Perron operator. We compare the performance of
Histogram Density Estimation(HDE) and Kernel Density Estimation(KDE) methods
and find that KDE generally outperforms HDE in terms of accuracy. However, it
is important to note that KDE exhibits limitations around boundary points and
jumps. Based on our research findings, we suggest the possibility of
incorporating other density estimation methods into this field and propose
future investigations into the application of KDE-based estimation for
high-dimensional maps. These findings provide valuable insights for researchers
and practitioners working on estimating the Frobenius-Perron operator and
highlight the potential of density estimation techniques in this area of study.

(MD) simulations within the computational complexity of classical MD force
fields. However, when applied outside their training domain, NN potential
predictions can be inaccurate, increasing the need for Uncertainty
Quantification (UQ). Bayesian modeling provides the mathematical framework for
UQ, but classical Bayesian methods based on Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) are
computationally intractable for NN potentials. By training graph NN potentials
for coarse-grained systems of liquid water and alanine dipeptide, we
demonstrate here that scalable Bayesian UQ via stochastic gradient MCMC
(SG-MCMC) yields reliable uncertainty estimates for MD observables. We show
that cold posteriors can reduce the required training data size and that for
reliable UQ, multiple Markov chains are needed. Additionally, we find that
SG-MCMC and the Deep Ensemble method achieve comparable results, despite
shorter training and less hyperparameter tuning of the latter. We show that
both methods can capture aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty reliably, but not
systematic uncertainty, which needs to be minimized by adequate modeling to
obtain accurate credible intervals for MD observables. Our results represent a
step towards accurate UQ that is of vital importance for trustworthy NN

                              <span>An end-to-end machine learning (ML) lifecycle consists of many iterative
processes, from data preparation and ML model design to model training and then
deploying the trained model for inference. When building an end-to-end
lifecycle for an ML problem, many ML pipelines must be designed and executed
that produce a huge number of lifecycle versions. Therefore, this paper
introduces VeML, a Version management system dedicated to end-to-end ML
Lifecycle. Our system tackles several crucial problems that other systems have
not solved. First, we address the high cost of building an ML lifecycle,
especially for large-scale and high-dimensional dataset. We solve this problem
by proposing to transfer the lifecycle of similar datasets managed in our
system to the new training data. We design an algorithm based on the core set
to compute similarity for large-scale, high-dimensional data efficiently.
Another critical issue is the model accuracy degradation by the difference
between training data and testing data during the ML lifetime, which leads to
lifecycle rebuild. Our system helps to detect this mismatch without getting
labeled data from testing data and rebuild the ML lifecycle for a new data
version. To demonstrate our contributions, we conduct experiments on
real-world, large-scale datasets of driving images and spatiotemporal sensor
data and show promising results.</span>

                              <span>Fuzzy time series forecasting (FTSF) is a typical forecasting method with
wide application. Traditional FTSF is regarded as an expert system which leads
to loss of the ability to recognize undefined features. The mentioned is the
main reason for poor forecasting with FTSF. To solve the problem, the proposed
model Differential Fuzzy Convolutional Neural Network (DFCNN) utilizes a
convolution neural network to re-implement FTSF with learnable ability. DFCNN
is capable of recognizing potential information and improving forecasting
accuracy. Thanks to the learnable ability of the neural network, the length of
fuzzy rules established in FTSF is expended to an arbitrary length that the
expert is not able to handle by the expert system. At the same time, FTSF
usually cannot achieve satisfactory performance of non-stationary time series
due to the trend of non-stationary time series. The trend of non-stationary
time series causes the fuzzy set established by FTSF to be invalid and causes
the forecasting to fail. DFCNN utilizes the Difference algorithm to weaken the
non-stationary of time series so that DFCNN can forecast the non-stationary
time series with a low error that FTSF cannot forecast in satisfactory
performance. After the mass of experiments, DFCNN has an excellent prediction
effect, which is ahead of the existing FTSF and common time series forecasting
algorithms. Finally, DFCNN provides further ideas for improving FTSF and holds

realized by networks of active processes with enormous complexity. They have
inspired many variants of modern machine learning one of them being reservoir
computing, in which stimulating a network of nodes with fading memory enables
computations and complex predictions. Reservoirs are implemented on computer
hardware, but also on unconventional physical substrates such as mechanical
oscillators, spins, or bacteria often summarized as physical reservoir
computing. Here we demonstrate physical reservoir computing with a synthetic
active microparticle system that self-organizes from an active and passive
component into inherently noisy nonlinear dynamical units. The
self-organization and dynamical response of the unit is the result of a delayed
propulsion of the microswimmer to a passive target. A reservoir of such units
with a self-coupling via the delayed response can perform predictive tasks
despite the strong noise resulting from Brownian motion of the microswimmers.
To achieve efficient noise suppression, we introduce a special architecture

                              <span>Low-count PET is an efficient way to reduce radiation exposure and
acquisition time, but the reconstructed images often suffer from low
signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), thus affecting diagnosis and other downstream
tasks. Recent advances in deep learning have shown great potential in improving
low-count PET image quality, but acquiring a large, centralized, and diverse
dataset from multiple institutions for training a robust model is difficult due
to privacy and security concerns of patient data. Moreover, low-count PET data
at different institutions may have different data distribution, thus requiring
personalized models. While previous federated learning (FL) algorithms enable
multi-institution collaborative training without the need of aggregating local
data, addressing the large domain shift in the application of
multi-institutional low-count PET denoising remains a challenge and is still
highly under-explored. In this work, we propose FedFTN, a personalized
federated learning strategy that addresses these challenges. FedFTN uses a
local deep feature transformation network (FTN) to modulate the feature outputs
of a globally shared denoising network, enabling personalized low-count PET
denoising for each institution. During the federated learning process, only the
denoising network&#x27;s weights are communicated and aggregated, while the FTN
remains at the local institutions for feature transformation. We evaluated our
method using a large-scale dataset of multi-institutional low-count PET imaging
data from three medical centers located across three continents, and showed
that FedFTN provides high-quality low-count PET images, outperforming previous
baseline FL reconstruction methods across all low-count levels at all three
institutions.</span>

                              <span>Constraint programming is known for being an efficient approach for solving
combinatorial problems. Important design choices in a solver are the branching
heuristics, which are designed to lead the search to the best solutions in a
minimum amount of time. However, developing these heuristics is a
time-consuming process that requires problem-specific expertise. This
observation has motivated many efforts to use machine learning to automatically
learn efficient heuristics without expert intervention. To the best of our
knowledge, it is still an open research question. Although several generic
variable-selection heuristics are available in the literature, the options for
a generic value-selection heuristic are more scarce. In this paper, we propose
to tackle this issue by introducing a generic learning procedure that can be
used to obtain a value-selection heuristic inside a constraint programming
solver. This has been achieved thanks to the combination of a deep Q-learning
algorithm, a tailored reward signal, and a heterogeneous graph neural network
architecture. Experiments on graph coloring, maximum independent set, and
maximum cut problems show that our framework is able to find better solutions
close to optimality without requiring a large amounts of backtracks while being
generic.</span>

                              <span>Existing causal models for link prediction assume an underlying set of
inherent node factors -- an innate characteristic defined at the node&#x27;s birth
-- that governs the causal evolution of links in the graph. In some causal
tasks, however, link formation is path-dependent: The outcome of link
interventions depends on existing links. Unfortunately, these existing causal
methods are not designed for path-dependent link formation, as the cascading
functional dependencies between links (arising from path dependence) are either
unidentifiable or require an impractical number of control variables. To
overcome this, we develop the first causal model capable of dealing with path
dependencies in link prediction. In this work we introduce the concept of
causal lifting, an invariance in causal models of independent interest that, on
graphs, allows the identification of causal link prediction queries using
limited interventional data. Further, we show how structural pairwise
embeddings exhibit lower bias and correctly represent the task&#x27;s causal
structure, as opposed to existing node embeddings, e.g., graph neural network
node embeddings and matrix factorization. Finally, we validate our theoretical
findings on three scenarios for causal link prediction tasks: knowledge base
completion, covariance matrix estimation and consumer-product recommendations.</span>

                              <span>This paper explores the application of emerging machine learning methods from
image super-resolution (SR) to the task of statistical downscaling. We
specifically focus on convolutional neural network-based Generative Adversarial
Networks (GANs). Our GANs are conditioned on low-resolution (LR) inputs to
generate high-resolution (HR) surface winds emulating Weather Research and
Forecasting (WRF) model simulations over North America. Unlike traditional SR
models, where LR inputs are idealized coarsened versions of the HR images, WRF
emulation involves using non-idealized LR and HR pairs resulting in
shared-scale mismatches due to internal variability. Our study builds upon
current SR-based statistical downscaling by experimenting with a novel
frequency-separation (FS) approach from the computer vision field. To assess
the skill of SR models, we carefully select evaluation metrics, and focus on
performance measures based on spatial power spectra. Our analyses reveal how
GAN configurations influence spatial structures in the generated fields,
particularly biases in spatial variability spectra. Using power spectra to
evaluate the FS experiments reveals that successful applications of FS in
computer vision do not translate to climate fields. However, the FS experiments
demonstrate the sensitivity of power spectra to a commonly used GAN-based SR
objective function, which helps interpret and understand its role in
determining spatial structures. This result motivates the development of a
novel partial frequency-separation scheme as a promising configuration option.
We also quantify the influence on GAN performance of non-idealized LR fields
resulting from internal variability. Furthermore, we conduct a spectra-based
feature-importance experiment allowing us to explore the dependence of the
spatial structure of generated fields on different physically relevant LR
covariates.</span>

of sensors and predictive models that generate uncertain data. The suggested
approach calculates the conformance between a process model and a
stochastically known trace and recovers the best alignment within this
stochastic trace as the true trace. The paper offers an analysis of the impact
of various cost models on trace recovery accuracy and makes use of a product
multi-graph to compare alternative trace recovery options. The average accuracy
of our approach, evaluated using two publicly available datasets, is
impressive, with an average recovery accuracy score of 90-97%, significantly
improving a common heuristic that chooses the most likely value for each

                              <span>Recognition problems in long-tailed data, where the sample size per class is
heavily skewed, have recently gained importance because the distribution of the
sample size per class in a dataset is generally exponential unless the sample
size is intentionally adjusted. Various approaches have been devised to address
these problems. Recently, weight balancing, which combines well-known classical
regularization techniques with two-stage training, has been proposed. Despite
its simplicity, it is known for its high performance against existing methods
devised in various ways. However, there is a lack of understanding as to why
this approach is effective for long-tailed data. In this study, we analyze the
method focusing on neural collapse and cone effect at each training stage and
find that it can be decomposed into the increase in Fisher&#x27;s discriminant ratio
of the feature extractor caused by weight decay and cross entropy loss and
implicit logit adjustment caused by weight decay and class-balanced loss. Our
analysis shows that the training method can be further simplified by reducing
the number of training stages to one while increasing accuracy.</span>

forgeries within a given dataset, where training and testing take place on the
in-distribution dataset. However, their performance deteriorates significantly
when presented with unseen samples. As a result, a reliable deepfake detection
system must remain impartial to forgery types, appearance, and quality for
guaranteed generalizable detection performance. Despite various attempts to
enhance cross-dataset generalization, the problem remains challenging,
particularly when testing against common post-processing perturbations, such as
video compression or blur. Hence, this study introduces a deepfake detection
framework, leveraging a self-supervised pre-training model that delivers
exceptional generalization ability, withstanding common corruptions and
enabling feature explainability. The framework comprises three key components:
a feature extractor based on vision Transformer architecture that is
pre-trained via self-supervised contrastive learning methodology, a graph
convolution network coupled with a Transformer discriminator, and a graph
Transformer relevancy map that provides a better understanding of manipulated
regions and further explains the model&#x27;s decision. To assess the effectiveness
of the proposed framework, several challenging experiments are conducted,
including in-data distribution performance, cross-dataset, cross-manipulation
generalization, and robustness against common post-production perturbations.

                              <span>The Fourier neural operator (FNO) is a powerful technique for learning
surrogate maps for partial differential equation (PDE) solution operators. For
many real-world applications, which often require high-resolution data points,
training time and memory usage are significant bottlenecks. While there are
mixed-precision training techniques for standard neural networks, those work
for real-valued datatypes on finite dimensions and therefore cannot be directly
applied to FNO, which crucially operates in the (complex-valued) Fourier domain
and in function spaces. On the other hand, since the Fourier transform is
already an approximation (due to discretization error), we do not need to
perform the operation at full precision. In this work, we (i) profile memory
and runtime for FNO with full and mixed-precision training, (ii) conduct a
study on the numerical stability of mixed-precision training of FNO, and (iii)
devise a training routine which substantially decreases training time and
memory usage (up to 34%), with little or no reduction in accuracy, on the
Navier-Stokes and Darcy flow equations. Combined with the recently proposed
tensorized FNO (Kossaifi et al., 2023), the resulting model has far better
performance while also being significantly faster than the original FNO.</span>

historical figures to tutorials on how to code -- all of which may be learned
by language models. However, while certain pieces of information are ubiquitous
on the web, others appear extremely rarely. In this paper, we study the
relationship between the knowledge memorized by large language models and the
information in pre-training datasets scraped from the web. In particular, we
show that a language model&#x27;s ability to answer a fact-based question relates to
how many documents associated with that question were seen during pre-training.
We identify these relevant documents by entity linking pre-training datasets
and counting documents that contain the same entities as a given
question-answer pair. Our results demonstrate strong correlational and causal
relationships between accuracy and relevant document count for numerous
question answering datasets (e.g., TriviaQA), pre-training corpora (e.g.,
ROOTS), and model sizes (e.g., 176B parameters). Moreover, while larger models
are better at learning long-tail knowledge, we estimate that today&#x27;s models
must be scaled by many orders of magnitude to reach competitive QA performance
on questions with little support in the pre-training data. Finally, we show
that retrieval-augmentation can reduce the dependence on relevant pre-training

                              <span>Machine learning methods have significantly improved in their predictive
capabilities, but at the same time they are becoming more complex and less
transparent. As a result, explainers are often relied on to provide
interpretability to these black-box prediction models. As crucial diagnostics
tools, it is important that these explainers themselves are robust. In this
paper we focus on one particular aspect of robustness, namely that an explainer
should give similar explanations for similar data inputs. We formalize this
notion by introducing and defining explainer astuteness, analogous to
astuteness of prediction functions. Our formalism allows us to connect
explainer robustness to the predictor&#x27;s probabilistic Lipschitzness, which
captures the probability of local smoothness of a function. We provide lower
bound guarantees on the astuteness of a variety of explainers (e.g., SHAP,
RISE, CXPlain) given the Lipschitzness of the prediction function. These
theoretical results imply that locally smooth prediction functions lend
themselves to locally robust explanations. We evaluate these results
empirically on simulated as well as real datasets.</span>

Our evaluation on 900 randomly generated parity games shows that this

                              <span>Secure aggregation is a critical component in federated learning (FL), which
enables the server to learn the aggregate model of the users without observing
their local models. Conventionally, secure aggregation algorithms focus only on
ensuring the privacy of individual users in a single training round. We contend
that such designs can lead to significant privacy leakages over multiple
training rounds, due to partial user selection/participation at each round of
FL. In fact, we show that the conventional random user selection strategies in
FL lead to leaking users&#x27; individual models within number of rounds that is
linear in the number of users. To address this challenge, we introduce a secure
aggregation framework, Multi-RoundSecAgg, with multi-round privacy guarantees.
In particular, we introduce a new metric to quantify the privacy guarantees of
FL over multiple training rounds, and develop a structured user selection
strategy that guarantees the long-term privacy of each user (over any number of
training rounds). Our framework also carefully accounts for the fairness and
the average number of participating users at each round. Our experiments on
MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets in the IID and the non-IID settings demonstrate the
performance improvement over the baselines, both in terms of privacy protection
and test accuracy.</span>

                              <span>Prompt learning approaches have made waves in natural language processing by
inducing better few-shot performance while they still follow a parametric-based
learning paradigm; the oblivion and rote memorization problems in learning may
encounter unstable generalization issues. Specifically, vanilla prompt learning
may struggle to utilize atypical instances by rote during fully-supervised
training or overfit shallow patterns with low-shot data. To alleviate such
limitations, we develop RetroPrompt with the motivation of decoupling knowledge
from memorization to help the model strike a balance between generalization and
memorization. In contrast with vanilla prompt learning, RetroPrompt constructs
an open-book knowledge-store from training instances and implements a retrieval
mechanism during the process of input, training and inference, thus equipping
the model with the ability to retrieve related contexts from the training
corpus as cues for enhancement. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
RetroPrompt can obtain better performance in both few-shot and zero-shot
settings. Besides, we further illustrate that our proposed RetroPrompt can
yield better generalization abilities with new datasets. Detailed analysis of
memorization indeed reveals RetroPrompt can reduce the reliance of language
models on memorization; thus, improving generalization for downstream tasks.

                              <span>Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) has emerged as a powerful solution for
the domain shift problem via transferring the knowledge from a labeled source
domain to a shifted unlabeled target domain. Despite the prevalence of UDA for
visual applications, it remains relatively less explored for time-series
applications. In this work, we propose a novel lightweight contrastive domain
adaptation framework called CoTMix for time-series data. Unlike existing
approaches that either use statistical distances or adversarial techniques, we
leverage contrastive learning solely to mitigate the distribution shift across
the different domains. Specifically, we propose a novel temporal mixup strategy
to generate two intermediate augmented views for the source and target domains.
Subsequently, we leverage contrastive learning to maximize the similarity
between each domain and its corresponding augmented view. The generated views
consider the temporal dynamics of time-series data during the adaptation
process while inheriting the semantics among the two domains. Hence, we
gradually push both domains towards a common intermediate space, mitigating the
distribution shift across them. Extensive experiments conducted on five
real-world time-series datasets show that our approach can significantly
outperform all state-of-the-art UDA methods. The implementation code of CoTMix

                              <span>Many studies have proposed machine-learning (ML) models for malware detection
and classification, reporting an almost-perfect performance. However, they
assemble ground-truth in different ways, use diverse static- and
dynamic-analysis techniques for feature extraction, and even differ on what
they consider a malware family. As a consequence, our community still lacks an
understanding of malware classification results: whether they are tied to the
nature and distribution of the collected dataset, to what extent the number of
families and samples in the training dataset influence performance, and how
well static and dynamic features complement each other.

This work sheds light on those open questions. by investigating the key
factors influencing ML-based malware detection and classification. For this, we
collect the largest balanced malware dataset so far with 67K samples from 670
families (100 samples each), and train state-of-the-art models for malware
detection and family classification using our dataset. Our results reveal that
static features perform better than dynamic features, and that combining both
only provides marginal improvement over static features. We discover no
correlation between packing and classification accuracy, and that missing
behaviors in dynamically-extracted features highly penalize their performance.
We also demonstrate how a larger number of families to classify make the
classification harder, while a higher number of samples per family increases
accuracy. Finally, we find that models trained on a uniform distribution of
samples per family better generalize on unseen data.</span>

inference algorithms to learn locally dominant force balances that explain
macroscopic pattern formation in self-organized active particle systems. The
self-organized emergence of macroscopic patterns from microscopic interactions
between self-propelled particles can be widely observed nature. Although
hydrodynamic theories help us better understand the physical basis of this
phenomenon, identifying a sufficient set of local interactions that shape,
regulate, and sustain self-organized structures in active particle systems
remains challenging. We investigate a classic hydrodynamic model of
self-propelled particles that produces a wide variety of patterns, like asters
and moving density bands. Our data-driven analysis shows that propagating bands
are formed by local alignment interactions driven by density gradients, while
steady-state asters are shaped by a mechanism of splay-induced negative
compressibility arising from strong particle interactions. Our method also
reveals analogous physical principles of pattern formation in a system where
the speed of the particle is influenced by local density. This demonstrates the
ability of our method to reveal physical commonalities across models. The
physical mechanisms inferred from the data are in excellent agreement with
analytical scaling arguments and experimental observations.</span>

applications such as image and text classification tasks. Yet, there is little
rigorous understanding of why and how various augmentations work. In this work,
we consider a family of linear transformations and study their effects on the
ridge estimator in an over-parametrized linear regression setting. First, we
show that transformations that preserve the labels of the data can improve
estimation by enlarging the span of the training data. Second, we show that
transformations that mix data can improve estimation by playing a
regularization effect. Finally, we validate our theoretical insights on MNIST.
Based on the insights, we propose an augmentation scheme that searches over the
space of transformations by how uncertain the model is about the transformed
data. We validate our proposed scheme on image and text datasets. For example,
our method outperforms random sampling methods by 1.24% on CIFAR-100 using
Wide-ResNet-28-10. Furthermore, we achieve comparable accuracy to the SoTA

                              <span>Approaches to recommendation are typically evaluated in one of two ways: (1)
via a (simulated) online experiment, often seen as the gold standard, or (2)
via some offline evaluation procedure, where the goal is to approximate the
outcome of an online experiment. Several offline evaluation metrics have been
adopted in the literature, inspired by ranking metrics prevalent in the field
of Information Retrieval. (Normalised) Discounted Cumulative Gain (nDCG) is one
such metric that has seen widespread adoption in empirical studies, and higher
(n)DCG values have been used to present new methods as the state-of-the-art in
top-$n$ recommendation for many years.

Our work takes a critical look at this approach, and investigates when we can
expect such metrics to approximate the gold standard outcome of an online
experiment. We formally present the assumptions that are necessary to consider
DCG an unbiased estimator of online reward and provide a derivation for this
metric from first principles, highlighting where we deviate from its
traditional uses in IR. Importantly, we show that normalising the metric
renders it inconsistent, in that even when DCG is unbiased, ranking competing
methods by their normalised DCG can invert their relative order. Through a
correlation analysis between off- and on-line experiments conducted on a
large-scale recommendation platform, we show that our unbiased DCG estimates
strongly correlate with online reward, even when some of the metric&#x27;s inherent
assumptions are violated. This statement no longer holds for its normalised
variant, suggesting that nDCG&#x27;s practical utility may be limited.</span>

                              <span>It has long been believed that the brain is highly modular both in terms of
structure and function, although recent evidence has led some to question the
extent of both types of modularity. We used artificial neural networks to test
the hypothesis that structural modularity is sufficient to guarantee functional
specialization, and find that in general, this doesn&#x27;t necessarily hold except
at extreme levels. We then systematically tested which features of the
environment and network do lead to the emergence of specialization. We used a
simple toy environment, task and network, allowing us precise control, and show
that in this setup, several distinct measures of specialization give
qualitatively similar results. We further find that (1) specialization can only
emerge in environments where features of that environment are meaningfully
separable, (2) specialization preferentially emerges when the network is
strongly resource-constrained, and (3) these findings are qualitatively similar
across different network architectures, but the quantitative relationships
depends on the architecture type. Finally, we show that functional
specialization varies dynamically across time, and demonstrate that these
dynamics depend on both the timing and bandwidth of information flow in the
network. We conclude that a static notion of specialization, based on
structural modularity, is likely too simple a framework for understanding
intelligent systems in situations of real-world complexity. We propose that
thoroughly stress testing candidate definitions of functional modularity in
simplified scenarios before extending to more complex data, network models and
electrophysiological recordings is likely to be a fruitful approach.</span>

                              <span>Training reinforcement learning (RL) agents using scalar reward signals is
often infeasible when an environment has sparse and non-Markovian rewards.
Moreover, handcrafting these reward functions before training is prone to
misspecification, especially when the environment&#x27;s dynamics are only partially
known. This paper proposes a novel pipeline for learning non-Markovian task
specifications as succinct finite-state &#x60;task automata&#x27; from episodes of agent
experience within unknown environments. We leverage two key algorithmic
insights. First, we learn a product MDP, a model composed of the
specification&#x27;s automaton and the environment&#x27;s MDP (both initially unknown),
by treating the product MDP as a partially observable MDP and using the
well-known Baum-Welch algorithm for learning hidden Markov models. Second, we
propose a novel method for distilling the task automaton (assumed to be a
deterministic finite automaton) from the learnt product MDP. Our learnt task
automaton enables the decomposition of a task into its constituent sub-tasks,
which improves the rate at which an RL agent can later synthesise an optimal
policy. It also provides an interpretable encoding of high-level environmental
and task features, so a human can readily verify that the agent has learnt
coherent tasks with no misspecifications. In addition, we take steps towards
ensuring that the learnt automaton is environment-agnostic, making it
well-suited for use in transfer learning. Finally, we provide experimental
results compared with two baselines to illustrate our algorithm&#x27;s performance
in different environments and tasks.</span>

                              <span>Recognizing handwritten digits is a challenging task primarily due to the
diversity of writing styles and the presence of noisy images. The widely used
MNIST dataset, which is commonly employed as a benchmark for this task,
includes distorted digits with irregular shapes, incomplete strokes, and
varying skew in both the training and testing datasets. Consequently, these
factors contribute to reduced accuracy in digit recognition. To overcome this
challenge, we propose a two-stage deep learning approach. In the first stage,
we create a simple neural network to identify distorted digits within the
training set. This model serves to detect and filter out such distorted and
ambiguous images. In the second stage, we exclude these identified images from
the training dataset and proceed to retrain the model using the filtered
dataset. This process aims to improve the classification accuracy and
confidence levels while mitigating issues of underfitting and overfitting. Our
experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach,
achieving an accuracy rate of over 99.5% on the testing dataset. This
significant improvement showcases the potential of our method in enhancing
digit classification accuracy. In our future work, we intend to explore the
scalability of this approach and investigate techniques to further enhance
accuracy by reducing the size of the training data.</span>

                              <span>Relational tables, where each row corresponds to an entity and each column
corresponds to an attribute, have been the standard for tables in relational
databases. However, such a standard cannot be taken for granted when dealing
with tables &quot;in the wild&quot;. Our survey of real spreadsheet-tables and web-tables
shows that over 30% of such tables do not conform to the relational standard,
for which complex table-restructuring transformations are needed before these
tables can be queried easily using SQL-based analytics tools. Unfortunately,
the required transformations are non-trivial to program, which has become a
substantial pain point for technical and non-technical users alike, as
evidenced by large numbers of forum questions in places like StackOverflow and
Excel/Tableau forums.

We develop an Auto-Tables system that can automatically synthesize pipelines
with multi-step transformations (in Python or other languages), to transform
non-relational tables into standard relational forms for downstream analytics,
obviating the need for users to manually program transformations. We compile an
extensive benchmark for this new task, by collecting 194 real test cases from
user spreadsheets and online forums. Our evaluation suggests that Auto-Tables
can successfully synthesize transformations for over 70% of test cases at
interactive speeds, without requiring any input from users, making this an
effective tool for both technical and non-technical users to prepare data for
analytics.</span>

train. It is therefore natural to wonder whether they are optimally trained.
Here we apply a recent advancement in stochastic thermodynamics which allows
bounding the speed at which one can go from the initial weight distribution to
the final distribution of the fully trained network, based on the ratio of
their Wasserstein-2 distance and the entropy production rate of the dynamical
process connecting them. Considering both gradient-flow and Langevin training
dynamics, we provide analytical expressions for these speed limits for linear
and linearizable neural networks e.g. Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK). Remarkably,
given some plausible scaling assumptions on the NTK spectra and spectral
decomposition of the labels -- learning is optimal in a scaling sense. Our
results are consistent with small-scale experiments with Convolutional Neural
Networks (CNNs) and Fully Connected Neural networks (FCNs) on CIFAR-10, showing
a short highly non-optimal regime followed by a longer optimal regime.</span>

offline Arabic handwritten text. Existing approaches typically utilize a
combination of convolutional neural networks for image feature extraction and
recurrent neural networks for temporal modeling, with connectionist temporal
classification used for text generation. However, these methods suffer from a
lack of parallelization due to the sequential nature of recurrent neural
networks. Furthermore, these models cannot account for linguistic rules,
necessitating the use of an external language model in the post-processing
stage to boost accuracy. To overcome these issues, we introduce two alternative
architectures, namely the Transformer Transducer and the standard
sequence-to-sequence Transformer, and compare their performance in terms of
accuracy and speed. Our approach can model language dependencies and relies
only on the attention mechanism, thereby making it more parallelizable and less
complex. We employ pre-trained Transformers for both image understanding and
language modeling. Our evaluation on the Arabic KHATT dataset demonstrates that

the development of various neural network architectures. Graph neural network
approaches, which jointly learn a graph structure based on the correlation of
raw values of multivariate time series while forecasting, have recently seen
great success. However, such solutions are often costly to train and difficult

Learning (ComFedL) algorithm for solving a new compositional Federated Learning
(FL) framework, which frequently appears in many data mining and machine
learning problems with a hierarchical structure such as distributionally robust
FL and model-agnostic meta learning (MAML). Moreover, we study the convergence
analysis of our ComFedL algorithm under some mild conditions, and prove that it
achieves a convergence rate of $O(\frac{1}{\sqrt{T}})$, where $T$ denotes the
number of iteration. To the best of our knowledge, our new Compositional FL
framework is the first work to bridge federated learning with composition
stochastic optimization. In particular, we first transform the distributionally
robust FL (i.e., a minimax optimization problem) into a simple composition
optimization problem by using KL divergence regularization. At the same time,
we also first transform the distribution-agnostic MAML problem (i.e., a minimax
optimization problem) into a simple yet effective composition optimization
problem. Finally, we apply two popular machine learning tasks, i.e.,
distributionally robust FL and MAML to demonstrate the effectiveness of our

                              <span>Non-intrusive load monitoring (NILM) identifies the status and power
consumption of various household appliances by disaggregating the total power
usage signal of an entire house. Efficient and accurate load monitoring
facilitates user profile establishment, intelligent household energy
management, and peak load shifting. This is beneficial for both the end-users
and utilities by improving the overall efficiency of a power distribution
network. Existing approaches mainly focus on developing an individual model for
each appliance. Those approaches typically rely on a large amount of
household-labeled data which is hard to collect. In this paper, we propose a
multi-appliance-task framework with a training-efficient sample augmentation
(SA) scheme that boosts the disaggregation performance with limited labeled
data. For each appliance, we develop a shared-hierarchical split structure for
its regression and classification tasks. In addition, we also propose a
two-dimensional attention mechanism in order to capture spatio-temporal
correlations among all appliances. With only one-day training data and limited
appliance operation profiles, the proposed SA algorithm can achieve comparable
test performance to the case of training with the full dataset. Finally,
simulation results show that our proposed approach features a significantly
improved performance over many baseline models. The relative errors can be
reduced by more than 50\% on average. The codes of this work are available at

                              <span>Robots operating in real-world environments must reason about possible
outcomes of stochastic actions and make decisions based on partial observations
of the true world state. A major challenge for making accurate and robust
action predictions is the problem of confounding, which if left untreated can
lead to prediction errors. The partially observable Markov decision process
(POMDP) is a widely-used framework to model these stochastic and
partially-observable decision-making problems. However, due to a lack of
explicit causal semantics, POMDP planning methods are prone to confounding bias
and thus in the presence of unobserved confounders may produce underperforming
policies. This paper presents a novel causally-informed extension of &quot;anytime
regularized determinized sparse partially observable tree&quot; (AR-DESPOT), a
modern anytime online POMDP planner, using causal modelling and inference to
eliminate errors caused by unmeasured confounder variables. We further propose
a method to learn offline the partial parameterisation of the causal model for
planning, from ground truth model data. We evaluate our methods on a toy
problem with an unobserved confounder and show that the learned causal model is
highly accurate, while our planning method is more robust to confounding and
produces overall higher performing policies than AR-DESPOT.</span>

                              <span>With the overwhelming trend of mask image modeling led by MAE, generative
pre-training has shown a remarkable potential to boost the performance of
fundamental models in 2D vision. However, in 3D vision, the over-reliance on
Transformer-based backbones and the unordered nature of point clouds have
restricted the further development of generative pre-training. In this paper,
we propose a novel 3D-to-2D generative pre-training method that is adaptable to
any point cloud model. We propose to generate view images from different
instructed poses via the cross-attention mechanism as the pre-training scheme.
Generating view images has more precise supervision than its point cloud
counterpart, thus assisting 3D backbones to have a finer comprehension of the
geometrical structure and stereoscopic relations of the point cloud.
Experimental results have proved the superiority of our proposed 3D-to-2D
generative pre-training over previous pre-training methods. Our method is also
effective in boosting the performance of architecture-oriented approaches,
achieving state-of-the-art performance when fine-tuning on ScanObjectNN
classification and ShapeNetPart segmentation tasks. Code is available at

using Neural Ordinary Differential Equations (Neural ODEs). However, for
accurate and meaningful predictions, it is crucial that the models follow the
underlying rules or laws that govern these systems. In this work, we propose a
self-adaptive penalty algorithm for Neural ODEs to enable modelling of
constrained natural systems. The proposed self-adaptive penalty function can
dynamically adjust the penalty parameters. The explicit introduction of prior
knowledge helps to increase the interpretability of Neural ODE -based models.
We validate the proposed approach by modelling three natural systems with prior
knowledge constraints: population growth, chemical reaction evolution, and
damped harmonic oscillator motion. The numerical experiments and a comparison
with other penalty Neural ODE approaches and \emph{vanilla} Neural ODE,
demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed self-adaptive penalty algorithm
for Neural ODEs in modelling constrained natural systems. Moreover, the
self-adaptive penalty approach provides more accurate and robust models with

to mitigate data distribution shifts when transferring knowledge from multiple
labeled source domains to an unlabeled target domain. We propose a novel MSDA
framework based on dictionary learning and optimal transport. We interpret each
domain in MSDA as an empirical distribution. As such, we express each domain as
a Wasserstein barycenter of dictionary atoms, which are empirical
distributions. We propose a novel algorithm, DaDiL, for learning via
mini-batches: (i) atom distributions; (ii) a matrix of barycentric coordinates.
Based on our dictionary, we propose two novel methods for MSDA: DaDil-R, based
on the reconstruction of labeled samples in the target domain, and DaDiL-E,
based on the ensembling of classifiers learned on atom distributions. We
evaluate our methods in 3 benchmarks: Caltech-Office, Office 31, and CRWU,
where we improved previous state-of-the-art by 3.15%, 2.29%, and 7.71% in

to mitigate the problem of exploding and vanishing gradients and increase task
performance in both feed-forward and recurrent networks (RNNs) when trained
with the backpropagation algorithm. Yet, little is known about how residual
connections in RNNs influence their dynamics and fading memory properties.
Here, we introduce weakly coupled residual recurrent networks (WCRNNs) in which
residual connections result in well-defined Lyapunov exponents and allow for
studying properties of fading memory. We investigate how the residual
connections of WCRNNs influence their performance, network dynamics, and memory
properties on a set of benchmark tasks. We show that several distinct forms of
residual connections yield effective inductive biases that result in increased
network expressivity. In particular, residual connections that (i) result in
network dynamics at the proximity of the edge of chaos, (ii) allow networks to
capitalize on characteristic spectral properties of the data, and (iii) result
in heterogeneous memory properties are shown to increase practical
expressivity. In addition, we demonstrate how our results can be extended to
non-linear residuals and introduce a weakly coupled residual initialization

                              <span>Representing source code in a generic input format is crucial to automate
software engineering tasks, e.g., applying machine learning algorithms to
extract information. Visualizing code representations can further enable human
experts to gain an intuitive insight into the code. Unfortunately, as of today,
there is no universal tool that can simultaneously visualise different types of
code representations. In this paper, we introduce a tool, CodeLens, which
provides a visual interaction environment that supports various representation
methods and helps developers understand and explore them. CodeLens is designed
to support multiple programming languages, such as Java, Python, and
JavaScript, and four types of code representations, including sequence of
tokens, abstract syntax tree (AST), data flow graph (DFG), and control flow
graph (CFG). By using CodeLens, developers can quickly visualize the specific
code representation and also obtain the represented inputs for models of code.

                              <span>With the increased deployment of machine learning models in various
real-world applications, researchers and practitioners alike have emphasized
the need for explanations of model behaviour. To this end, two broad strategies
have been outlined in prior literature to explain models. Post hoc explanation
methods explain the behaviour of complex black-box models by highlighting
features that are critical to model predictions; however, prior work has shown
that these explanations may not be faithful, and even more concerning is our
inability to verify them. Specifically, it is nontrivial to evaluate if a given
attribution is correct with respect to the underlying model. Inherently
interpretable models, on the other hand, circumvent these issues by explicitly
encoding explanations into model architecture, meaning their explanations are
naturally faithful and verifiable, but they often exhibit poor predictive
performance due to their limited expressive power. In this work, we aim to
bridge the gap between the aforementioned strategies by proposing Verifiability
Tuning (VerT), a method that transforms black-box models into models that
naturally yield faithful and verifiable feature attributions. We begin by
introducing a formal theoretical framework to understand verifiability and show
that attributions produced by standard models cannot be verified. We then
leverage this framework to propose a method to build verifiable models and
feature attributions out of fully trained black-box models. Finally, we perform
extensive experiments on semi-synthetic and real-world datasets, and show that
VerT produces models that (1) yield explanations that are correct and
verifiable and (2) are faithful to the original black-box models they are meant
to explain.</span>

                              <span>Preserving training dynamics across batch sizes is an important tool for
practical machine learning as it enables the trade-off between batch size and
wall-clock time. This trade-off is typically enabled by a scaling rule, for
example, in stochastic gradient descent, one should scale the learning rate
linearly with the batch size. Another important tool for practical machine
learning is the model Exponential Moving Average (EMA), which is a model copy
that does not receive gradient information, but instead follows its target
model with some momentum. This model EMA can improve the robustness and
generalization properties of supervised learning, stabilize pseudo-labeling,
and provide a learning signal for Self-Supervised Learning (SSL). Prior works
have treated the model EMA separately from optimization, leading to different
training dynamics across batch sizes and lower model performance. In this work,
we provide a scaling rule for optimization in the presence of model EMAs and
demonstrate its validity across a range of architectures, optimizers, and data
modalities. We also show the rule&#x27;s validity where the model EMA contributes to
the optimization of the target model, enabling us to train EMA-based
pseudo-labeling and SSL methods at small and large batch sizes. For SSL, we
enable training of BYOL up to batch size 24,576 without sacrificing
performance, optimally a 6$\times$ wall-clock time reduction.</span>

                              <span>The UNet architecture, based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), has
demonstrated its remarkable performance in medical image analysis. However, it
faces challenges in capturing long-range dependencies due to the limited
receptive fields and inherent bias of convolutional operations. Recently,
numerous transformer-based techniques have been incorporated into the UNet
architecture to overcome this limitation by effectively capturing global
feature correlations. However, the integration of the Transformer modules may
result in the loss of local contextual information during the global feature
fusion process. To overcome these challenges, we propose a 2D medical image
segmentation model called Multi-scale Cross Perceptron Attention Network
(MCPA). The MCPA consists of three main components: an encoder, a decoder, and
a Cross Perceptron. The Cross Perceptron first captures the local correlations
using multiple Multi-scale Cross Perceptron modules, facilitating the fusion of
features across scales. The resulting multi-scale feature vectors are then
spatially unfolded, concatenated, and fed through a Global Perceptron module to
model global dependencies. Furthermore, we introduce a Progressive Dual-branch
Structure to address the semantic segmentation of the image involving finer
tissue structures. This structure gradually shifts the segmentation focus of
MCPA network training from large-scale structural features to more
sophisticated pixel-level features. We evaluate our proposed MCPA model on
several publicly available medical image datasets from different tasks and
devices, including the open large-scale dataset of CT (Synapse), MRI (ACDC),
fundus camera (DRIVE, CHASE_DB1, HRF), and OCTA (ROSE). The experimental
results show that our MCPA model achieves state-of-the-art performance. The

                              <span>Augmentation techniques and sampling strategies are crucial in contrastive
learning, but in most existing works, augmentation techniques require careful
design, and their sampling strategies can only capture a small amount of
intrinsic supervision information. Additionally, the existing methods require
complex designs to obtain two different representations of the data. To
overcome these limitations, we propose a novel framework called the
Self-Contrastive Graph Diffusion Network (SCGDN). Our framework consists of two
main components: the Attentional Module (AttM) and the Diffusion Module (DiFM).
AttM aggregates higher-order structure and feature information to get an
excellent embedding, while DiFM balances the state of each node in the graph
through Laplacian diffusion learning and allows the cooperative evolution of
adjacency and feature information in the graph. Unlike existing methodologies,
SCGDN is an augmentation-free approach that avoids &quot;sampling bias&quot; and semantic
drift, without the need for pre-training. We conduct a high-quality sampling of
samples based on structure and feature information. If two nodes are neighbors,
they are considered positive samples of each other. If two disconnected nodes
are also unrelated on $k$NN graph, they are considered negative samples for
each other. The contrastive objective reasonably uses our proposed sampling
strategies, and the redundancy reduction term minimizes redundant information
in the embedding and can well retain more discriminative information. In this
novel framework, the graph self-contrastive learning paradigm gives expression
to a powerful force. SCGDN effectively balances between preserving high-order
structure information and avoiding overfitting. The results manifest that SCGDN
can consistently generate outperformance over both the contrastive methods and
the classical methods.</span>

                              <span>Here we develop variants of SGD (stochastic gradient descent) with an
adaptive step size that make use of the sampled loss values. In particular, we
focus on solving a finite sum-of-terms problem, also known as empirical risk
minimization. We first detail an idealized adaptive method called
$\texttt{SPS}_+$ that makes use of the sampled loss values and assumes
knowledge of the sampled loss at optimality. This $\texttt{SPS}_+$ is a minor
modification of the SPS (Stochastic Polyak Stepsize) method, where the step
size is enforced to be positive. We then show that $\texttt{SPS}_+$ achieves
the best known rates of convergence for SGD in the Lipschitz non-smooth. We
then move onto to develop $\texttt{FUVAL}$, a variant of $\texttt{SPS}_+$ where
the loss values at optimality are gradually learned, as opposed to being given.
We give three viewpoints of $\texttt{FUVAL}$, as a projection based method, as
a variant of the prox-linear method, and then as a particular online SGD
method. We then present a convergence analysis of $\texttt{FUVAL}$ and
experimental results. The shortcomings of our work is that the convergence
analysis of $\texttt{FUVAL}$ shows no advantage over SGD. Another shortcomming
is that currently only the full batch version of $\texttt{FUVAL}$ shows a minor
advantages of GD (Gradient Descent) in terms of sensitivity to the step size.
The stochastic version shows no clear advantage over SGD. We conjecture that
large mini-batches are required to make $\texttt{FUVAL}$ competitive.

Currently the new $\texttt{FUVAL}$ method studied in this paper does not
offer any clear theoretical or practical advantage. We have chosen to make this
draft available online nonetheless because of some of the analysis techniques
we use, such as the non-smooth analysis of $\texttt{SPS}_+$, and also to show
an apparently interesting approach that currently does not work.</span>

assisting researchers in the field of adversarial machine learning. As a case
study, we evaluate the robustness of AI-Guardian, a recent defense to
adversarial examples published at IEEE S&amp;P 2023, a top computer security

We write none of the code to attack this model, and instead prompt GPT-4 to
implement all attack algorithms following our instructions and guidance. This
process was surprisingly effective and efficient, with the language model at
times producing code from ambiguous instructions faster than the author of this
paper could have done. We conclude by discussing (1) the warning signs present

PyTorch. After multiple filtering steps, we select the top 300 repositories
with the highest number of closed issues. We manually investigate the extracted
repositories to exclude non-ML-based systems. Our investigation involved a
manual inspection of 386 sampled reported issues in the identified ML-based
systems to indicate whether they affect ML components or not. Our analysis
shows that nearly half of the real issues reported in ML-based systems are ML
bugs, indicating that ML components are more error-prone than non-ML
components. Next, we thoroughly examined 109 identified ML bugs to identify
their root causes, symptoms, and calculate their required fixing time. The
results also revealed that ML bugs have significantly different characteristics
compared to non-ML bugs, in terms of the complexity of bug-fixing (number of
commits, changed files, and changed lines of code). Based on our results,
fixing ML bugs are more costly and ML components are more error-prone, compared
to non-ML bugs and non-ML components respectively. Hence, paying a significant
attention to the reliability of the ML components is crucial in ML-based
systems.</span>

                              <span>How to accurately measure the relevance and redundancy of features is an
age-old challenge in the field of feature selection. However, existing
filter-based feature selection methods cannot directly measure redundancy for
continuous data. In addition, most methods rely on manually specifying the
number of features, which may introduce errors in the absence of expert
knowledge. In this paper, we propose a non-parametric feature selection
algorithm based on maximum inter-class variation and minimum redundancy,
abbreviated as MVMR-FS. We first introduce supervised and unsupervised kernel
density estimation on the features to capture their similarities and
differences in inter-class and overall distributions. Subsequently, we present
the criteria for maximum inter-class variation and minimum redundancy (MVMR),
wherein the inter-class probability distributions are employed to reflect
feature relevance and the distances between overall probability distributions
are used to quantify redundancy. Finally, we employ an AGA to search for the
feature subset that minimizes the MVMR. Compared with ten state-of-the-art
methods, MVMR-FS achieves the highest average accuracy and improves the
accuracy by 5% to 11%.</span>

operate in high-stress environments, often in combat or tactical situations.
This study proposes a predictive maintenance-based ensemble system that aids in
predicting potential maintenance needs based on sensor data collected from
these vehicles. The proposed model&#x27;s architecture involves various models such
as Light Gradient Boosting, Random Forest, Decision Tree, Extra Tree Classifier

EfficientDET supervised learning model and the unsupervised RX spectral
classifier, to 98.9 GB of drone imagery from the Wu-Murad wilderness search and
rescue (WSAR) effort in Japan and identifies 3 directions for future research.
There have been at least 19 proposed approaches and 3 datasets aimed at
locating missing persons in drone imagery, but only 3 approaches (2
unsupervised and 1 of an unknown structure) are referenced in the literature as
having been used in an actual WSAR operation. Of these proposed approaches, the
EfficientDET architecture and the unsupervised spectral RX classifier were
selected as the most appropriate for this setting. The EfficientDET model was
applied to the HERIDAL dataset and despite achieving performance that is
statistically equivalent to the state-of-the-art, the model fails to translate
to the real world in terms of false positives (e.g., identifying tree limbs and
rocks as people), and false negatives (e.g., failing to identify members of the
search team). The poor results in practice for algorithms that showed good
results on datasets suggest 3 areas of future research: more realistic datasets
for wilderness SAR, computer vision models that are capable of seamlessly
handling the variety of imagery that can be collected during actual WSAR
operations, and better alignment on performance measures.</span>

                              <span>Counterfactual examples have emerged as an effective approach to produce
simple and understandable post-hoc explanations. In the context of graph
classification, previous work has focused on generating counterfactual
explanations by manipulating the most elementary units of a graph, i.e.,
removing an existing edge, or adding a non-existing one. In this paper, we
claim that such language of explanation might be too fine-grained, and turn our
attention to some of the main characterizing features of real-world complex
networks, such as the tendency to close triangles, the existence of recurring
motifs, and the organization into dense modules. We thus define a general
density-based counterfactual search framework to generate instance-level
counterfactual explanations for graph classifiers, which can be instantiated
with different notions of dense substructures. In particular, we show two
specific instantiations of this general framework: a method that searches for
counterfactual graphs by opening or closing triangles, and a method driven by
maximal cliques. We also discuss how the general method can be instantiated to
exploit any other notion of dense substructures, including, for instance, a
given taxonomy of nodes. We evaluate the effectiveness of our approaches in 7
brain network datasets and compare the counterfactual statements generated
according to several widely-used metrics. Results confirm that adopting a
semantic-relevant unit of change like density is essential to define versatile
and interpretable counterfactual explanation methods.</span>

families. Combined with previous works on the quadratic variance condition,
this directly implies convergence of BBVI with the use of projected stochastic

                              <span>Complex interactions between two opposing agents frequently occur in domains
of machine learning, game theory, and other application domains. Quantitatively
analyzing the strategies involved can provide an objective basis for
decision-making. One such critical scenario is shot-taking in football, where
decisions, such as whether the attacker should shoot or pass the ball and
whether the defender should attempt to block the shot, play a crucial role in
the outcome of the game. However, there are currently no effective data-driven
and/or theory-based approaches to analyzing such situations. To address this
issue, we proposed a novel framework to analyze such scenarios based on game
theory, where we estimate the expected payoff with machine learning (ML)
models, and additional features for ML models were extracted with a
theory-based shot block model. Conventionally, successes or failures (1 or 0)
are used as payoffs, while a success shot (goal) is extremely rare in football.
Therefore, we proposed the Expected Probability of Shot On Target (xSOT) metric
to evaluate players&#x27; actions even if the shot results in no goal; this allows
for effective differentiation and comparison between different shots and even
enables counterfactual shot situation analysis. In our experiments, we have
validated the framework by comparing it with baseline and ablated models.
Furthermore, we have observed a high correlation between the xSOT and existing
metrics. This alignment of information suggests that xSOT provides valuable
insights. Lastly, as an illustration, we studied optimal strategies in the
World Cup 2022 and analyzed a shot situation in EURO 2020.</span>

                              <span>Turbulence parametrizations will remain a necessary building block in
kilometer-scale Earth system models. In convective boundary layers, where the
mean vertical gradients of conserved properties such as potential temperature
and moisture are approximately zero, the standard ansatz which relates
turbulent fluxes to mean vertical gradients via an eddy diffusivity has to be
extended by mass flux parametrizations for the typically asymmetric up- and
downdrafts in the atmospheric boundary layer. In this work, we present a
parametrization for a dry convective boundary layer based on a generative
adversarial network. The model incorporates the physics of self-similar layer
growth following from the classical mixed layer theory by Deardorff. This
enhances the training data base of the generative machine learning algorithm
and thus significantly improves the predicted statistics of the synthetically
generated turbulence fields at different heights inside the boundary layer. The
algorithm training is based on fully three-dimensional direct numerical
simulation data. Differently to stochastic parametrizations, our model is able
to predict the highly non-Gaussian transient statistics of buoyancy
fluctuations, vertical velocity, and buoyancy flux at different heights thus
also capturing the fastest thermals penetrating into the stabilized top region.
The results of our generative algorithm agree with standard two-equation or
multi-plume stochastic mass-flux schemes. The present parametrization provides
additionally the granule-type horizontal organization of the turbulent
convection which cannot be obtained in any of the other model closures. Our
work paves the way to efficient data-driven convective parametrizations in
other natural flows, such as moist convection, upper ocean mixing, or
convection in stellar interiors.</span>

                              <span>We propose the Thinker algorithm, a novel approach that enables reinforcement
learning agents to autonomously interact with and utilize a learned world
model. The Thinker algorithm wraps the environment with a world model and
introduces new actions designed for interacting with the world model. These
model-interaction actions enable agents to perform planning by proposing
alternative plans to the world model before selecting a final action to execute
in the environment. This approach eliminates the need for hand-crafted planning
algorithms by enabling the agent to learn how to plan autonomously and allows
for easy interpretation of the agent&#x27;s plan with visualization. We demonstrate
the algorithm&#x27;s effectiveness through experimental results in the game of
Sokoban and the Atari 2600 benchmark, where the Thinker algorithm achieves
state-of-the-art performance and competitive results, respectively.
Visualizations of agents trained with the Thinker algorithm demonstrate that
they have learned to plan effectively with the world model to select better
actions. The algorithm&#x27;s generality opens a new research direction on how a
world model can be used in reinforcement learning and how planning can be
seamlessly integrated into an agent&#x27;s decision-making process.</span>

datasets suitable for machine learning (ML) training poses a significant
challenge. Existing experimental datasets are often restricted, with limited
availability and sparse ground truth data, impeding our understanding of this
complex multi-physics phenomena. To bridge this gap, we present the BubbleML
Dataset(https://github.com/HPCForge/BubbleML) which leverages physics-driven
simulations to provide accurate ground truth information for various boiling
scenarios, encompassing nucleate pool boiling, flow boiling, and sub-cooled
boiling. This extensive dataset covers a wide range of parameters, including
varying gravity conditions, flow rates, sub-cooling levels, and wall superheat,
comprising 51 simulations. BubbleML is validated against experimental
observations and trends, establishing it as an invaluable resource for ML
research. Furthermore, we showcase its potential to facilitate exploration of
diverse downstream tasks by introducing two benchmarks: (a) optical flow
analysis to capture bubble dynamics, and (b) operator networks for learning
temperature dynamics. The BubbleML dataset and its benchmarks serve as a

                              <span>Graphs can be leveraged to model polyphonic multitrack symbolic music, where
notes, chords and entire sections may be linked at different levels of the
musical hierarchy by tonal and rhythmic relationships. Nonetheless, there is a
lack of works that consider graph representations in the context of deep
learning systems for music generation. This paper bridges this gap by
introducing a novel graph representation for music and a deep Variational
Autoencoder that generates the structure and the content of musical graphs
separately, one after the other, with a hierarchical architecture that matches
the structural priors of music. By separating the structure and content of
musical graphs, it is possible to condition generation by specifying which
instruments are played at certain times. This opens the door to a new form of
human-computer interaction in the context of music co-creation. After training
the model on existing MIDI datasets, the experiments show that the model is
able to generate appealing short and long musical sequences and to
realistically interpolate between them, producing music that is tonally and
rhythmically consistent. Finally, the visualization of the embeddings shows
that the model is able to organize its latent space in accordance with known
musical concepts.</span>

                              <span>In the medical field, federated learning commonly deals with highly
imbalanced datasets, including skin lesions and gastrointestinal images.
Existing federated methods under highly imbalanced datasets primarily focus on
optimizing a global model without incorporating the intra-class variations that
can arise in medical imaging due to different populations, findings, and
scanners. In this paper, we study the inter-client intra-class variations with
publicly available self-supervised auxiliary networks. Specifically, we find
that employing a shared auxiliary pre-trained model, like MoCo-V2, locally on
every client yields consistent divergence measurements. Based on these
findings, we derive a dynamic balanced model aggregation via self-supervised
priors (MAS) to guide the global model optimization. Fed-MAS can be utilized
with different local learning methods for effective model aggregation toward a
highly robust and unbiased global model. Our code is available at

across the globe. Accurate information of heat extremes is needed to support
the development of actionable mitigation and adaptation strategies. Regional
climate models are commonly used to better understand the dynamics of these
events. These models have very large input parameter sets, and the parameters
within the physics schemes substantially influence the model&#x27;s performance.
However, parameter sensitivity analysis (SA) of regional models for heat
extremes is largely unexplored. Here, we focus on the southeast Australian
region, one of the global hotspots of heat extremes. In southeast Australia
Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model is the widely used regional model
to simulate extreme weather events across the region. Hence in this study, we
focus on the sensitivity of WRF model parameters to surface meteorological
variables such as temperature, relative humidity, and wind speed during two
extreme heat events over southeast Australia. Due to the presence of multiple
parameters and their complex relationship with output variables, a machine
learning (ML) surrogate-based global sensitivity analysis method is considered
for the SA. The ML surrogate-based Sobol SA is used to identify the sensitivity
of 24 adjustable parameters in seven different physics schemes of the WRF
model. Results show that out of these 24, only three parameters, namely the
scattering tuning parameter, multiplier of saturated soil water content, and
profile shape exponent in the momentum diffusivity coefficient, are important
for the considered meteorological variables. These SA results are consistent
for the two different extreme heat events. Further, we investigated the
physical significance of sensitive parameters. This study&#x27;s results will help
in further optimising WRF parameters to improve model simulation.</span>

real-life problems around the globe. Their performance is strictly connected
with the quality of labels used in training. Unfortunately, acquiring
good-quality annotations for many tasks is infeasible or too expensive to be
done in practice. To tackle this challenge, active learning algorithms are
commonly employed to select only the most relevant data for labeling. However,
this is possible only when the quality and quantity of labels acquired from
experts are sufficient. Unfortunately, in many applications, a trade-off
between annotating individual samples by multiple annotators to increase label
quality vs. annotating new samples to increase the total number of labeled
instances is necessary. In this paper, we address the issue of faulty data
annotations in the context of active learning. In particular, we propose two
novel annotation unification algorithms that utilize unlabeled parts of the
sample space. The proposed methods require little to no intersection between
samples annotated by different experts. Our experiments on four public datasets

                              <span>Traffic forecasting, which aims to predict traffic conditions based on
historical observations, has been an enduring research topic and is widely
recognized as an essential component of intelligent transportation. Recent
proposals on Spatial-Temporal Graph Neural Networks (STGNNs) have made
significant progress by combining sequential models with graph convolution
networks. However, due to high complexity issues, STGNNs only focus on
short-term traffic forecasting, e.g., 1-hour forecasting, while ignoring more
practical long-term forecasting. In this paper, we make the first attempt to
explore long-term traffic forecasting, e.g., 1-day forecasting. To this end, we
first reveal its unique challenges in exploiting multi-scale representations.
Then, we propose a novel Hierarchical U-net TransFormer (HUTFormer) to address
the issues of long-term traffic forecasting. HUTFormer consists of a
hierarchical encoder and decoder to jointly generate and utilize multi-scale
representations of traffic data. Specifically, for the encoder, we propose
window self-attention and segment merging to extract multi-scale
representations from long-term traffic data. For the decoder, we design a
cross-scale attention mechanism to effectively incorporate multi-scale
representations. In addition, HUTFormer employs an efficient input embedding
strategy to address the complexity issues. Extensive experiments on four
traffic datasets show that the proposed HUTFormer significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art traffic forecasting and long time series forecasting
baselines.</span>

                              <span>AB testing aids business operators with their decision making, and is
considered the gold standard method for learning from data to improve digital
user experiences. However, there is usually a gap between the requirements of
practitioners, and the constraints imposed by the statistical hypothesis
testing methodologies commonly used for analysis of AB tests. These include the
lack of statistical power in multivariate designs with many factors,
correlations between these factors, the need of sequential testing for early
stopping, and the inability to pool knowledge from past tests. Here, we propose
a solution that applies hierarchical Bayesian estimation to address the above
limitations. In comparison to current sequential AB testing methodology, we
increase statistical power by exploiting correlations between factors, enabling
sequential testing and progressive early stopping, without incurring excessive
false positive risk. We also demonstrate how this methodology can be extended
to enable the extraction of composite global learnings from past AB tests, to
accelerate future tests. We underpin our work with a solid theoretical
framework that articulates the value of hierarchical estimation. We demonstrate
its utility using both numerical simulations and a large set of real-world AB
tests. Together, these results highlight the practical value of our approach
for statistical inference in the technology industry.</span>

                              <span>Algorithmic fairness has been a serious concern and received lots of interest
in machine learning community. In this paper, we focus on the bipartite ranking
scenario, where the instances come from either the positive or negative class
and the goal is to learn a ranking function that ranks positive instances
higher than negative ones. While there could be a trade-off between fairness
and performance, we propose a model agnostic post-processing framework xOrder
for achieving fairness in bipartite ranking and maintaining the algorithm
classification performance. In particular, we optimize a weighted sum of the
utility as identifying an optimal warping path across different protected
groups and solve it through a dynamic programming process. xOrder is compatible
with various classification models and ranking fairness metrics, including
supervised and unsupervised fairness metrics. In addition to binary groups,
xOrder can be applied to multiple protected groups. We evaluate our proposed
algorithm on four benchmark data sets and two real-world patient electronic
health record repositories. xOrder consistently achieves a better balance
between the algorithm utility and ranking fairness on a variety of datasets
with different metrics. From the visualization of the calibrated ranking
scores, xOrder mitigates the score distribution shifts of different groups
compared with baselines. Moreover, additional analytical results verify that
xOrder achieves a robust performance when faced with fewer samples and a bigger
difference between training and testing ranking score distributions.</span>

these lines have focused on simple descriptions, which are not always useful
for varying types of input mixtures. In this work, we present an approach in
which a model, given an input mixture and partial semantic information about a
target source, is trained to extract additional semantic data. We then leverage
this pre-trained model to improve the separation performance of an uncoupled
multi-conditional separation network. Our experiments demonstrate that the
separation performance of this multi-conditional model is significantly
improved, approaching the performance of an oracle model with complete semantic

                              <span>To ensure the reliable use of classification systems in medical applications,
it is crucial to prevent silent failures. This can be achieved by either
designing classifiers that are robust enough to avoid failures in the first
place, or by detecting remaining failures using confidence scoring functions
(CSFs). A predominant source of failures in image classification is
distribution shifts between training data and deployment data. To understand
the current state of silent failure prevention in medical imaging, we conduct
the first comprehensive analysis comparing various CSFs in four biomedical
tasks and a diverse range of distribution shifts. Based on the result that none
of the benchmarked CSFs can reliably prevent silent failures, we conclude that
a deeper understanding of the root causes of failures in the data is required.
To facilitate this, we introduce SF-Visuals, an interactive analysis tool that
uses latent space clustering to visualize shifts and failures. On the basis of
various examples, we demonstrate how this tool can help researchers gain
insight into the requirements for safe application of classification systems in
the medical domain. The open-source benchmark and tool are at:

classify its understanding under the inconceivable missions. Different leveled
challenges complicated this task, one of is the prediction of a protein&#x27;s
function. In recent years, significant progress has been made in this field
through the development of various machine learning approaches. However, most
existing methods formulate the task as a multi-classification problem, i.e
assigning predefined labels to proteins. In this work, we propose a novel
approach, \textbf{Prot2Text}, which predicts a protein function&#x27;s in a free
text style, moving beyond the conventional binary or categorical
classifications. By combining Graph Neural Networks(GNNs) and Large Language
Models(LLMs), in an encoder-decoder framework, our model effectively integrates
diverse data types including proteins&#x27; sequences, structures, and textual
annotations. This multimodal approach allows for a holistic representation of
proteins&#x27; functions, enabling the generation of detailed and accurate
descriptions. To evaluate our model, we extracted a multimodal protein dataset
from SwissProt, and demonstrate empirically the effectiveness of Prot2Text.
These results highlight the transformative impact of multimodal models,
specifically the fusion of GNNs and LLMs, empowering researchers with powerful
tools for more accurate prediction of proteins&#x27; functions. The code, the models

technique. However, implementation of FL over modern wireless networks faces
key challenges caused by (i) dynamics of the network conditions and (ii) the
coexistence of multiple FL services/tasks and other network services in the
system, which are not jointly considered in prior works. Motivated by these
challenges, we introduce a generic FL paradigm over NextG networks, called
dynamic multi-service FL (DMS-FL). We identify three unexplored design
considerations in DMS-FL: (i) FL service operator accumulation, (ii) wireless
resource fragmentation, and (iii) signal strength fluctuations. We take the
first steps towards addressing these design considerations by proposing a novel

unleashes the full potential of Open RAN (O-RAN) systems and introduces an
elastic resource provisioning methodology to execute FL services. It further
constitutes a multi-time-scale FL management system that introduces three

pivotal attributes of engaging information: Representativeness, Ease-of-use,
Affect, and Distribution. Conceptualized within the theoretical framework of
Cumulative Prospect Theory, the model integrates key cognitive biases with
computational linguistics and natural language processing to develop a
multidimensional perspective on information engagement. A rigorous testing
protocol was implemented, involving 50 randomly selected pairs of synonymous
words (100 words in total) from the WordNet database. These words&#x27; engagement
levels were evaluated through a large-scale online survey (n &#x3D; 80,500) to
derive empirical IE metrics. The READ attributes for each word were then
computed and their predictive efficacy examined. The findings affirm the READ
model&#x27;s robustness, accurately predicting a word&#x27;s IE level and distinguishing
the more engaging word from a pair of synonyms with an 84% accuracy rate. The
READ model&#x27;s potential extends across various domains, including business,

influencing both the rate of convergence of gradient descent (GD) and the
functions that are reachable with GD in finite training time. As such, there is
a great need for methods that can modify this bias according to the task at
hand. To that end, we introduce Modified Spectrum Kernels (MSKs), a novel
family of constructed kernels that can be used to approximate kernels with
desired eigenvalues for which no closed form is known. We leverage the duality

                              <span>In this paper, we study the denoising diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM) in
wavelet space, instead of pixel space, for visual synthesis. Considering the
wavelet transform represents the image in spatial and frequency domains, we
carefully design a novel architecture SFUNet to effectively capture the
correlation for both domains. Specifically, in the standard denoising U-Net for
pixel data, we supplement the 2D convolutions and spatial-only attention layers
with our spatial frequency-aware convolution and attention modules to jointly
model the complementary information from spatial and frequency domains in
wavelet data. Our new architecture can be used as a drop-in replacement to the
pixel-based network and is compatible with the vanilla DDPM training process.
By explicitly modeling the wavelet signals, we find our model is able to
generate images with higher quality on CIFAR-10, FFHQ, LSUN-Bedroom, and
LSUN-Church datasets, than the pixel-based counterpart.</span>

                              <span>Federated learning (FL) collaboratively models user data in a decentralized
way. However, in the real world, non-identical and independent data
distributions (non-IID) among clients hinder the performance of FL due to three
issues, i.e., (1) the class statistics shifting, (2) the insufficient
hierarchical information utilization, and (3) the inconsistency in aggregating
clients. To address the above issues, we propose HyperFed which contains three
main modules, i.e., hyperbolic prototype Tammes initialization (HPTI),
hyperbolic prototype learning (HPL), and consistent aggregation (CA). Firstly,
HPTI in the server constructs uniformly distributed and fixed class prototypes,
and shares them with clients to match class statistics, further guiding
consistent feature representation for local clients. Secondly, HPL in each
client captures the hierarchical information in local data with the supervision
of shared class prototypes in the hyperbolic model space. Additionally, CA in
the server mitigates the impact of the inconsistent deviations from clients to
server. Extensive studies of four datasets prove that HyperFed is effective in
enhancing the performance of FL under the non-IID set.</span>

                              <span>With advances in generative artificial intelligence (AI), it is now possible
to produce realistic-looking automated reports for preliminary reads of
radiology images. This can expedite clinical workflows, improve accuracy and
reduce overall costs. However, it is also well-known that such models often
hallucinate, leading to false findings in the generated reports. In this paper,
we propose a new method of fact-checking of AI-generated reports using their
associated images. Specifically, the developed examiner differentiates real and
fake sentences in reports by learning the association between an image and
sentences describing real or potentially fake findings. To train such an
examiner, we first created a new dataset of fake reports by perturbing the
findings in the original ground truth radiology reports associated with images.
Text encodings of real and fake sentences drawn from these reports are then
paired with image encodings to learn the mapping to real/fake labels. The
utility of such an examiner is demonstrated for verifying automatically
generated reports by detecting and removing fake sentences. Future generative
AI approaches can use the resulting tool to validate their reports leading to a
more responsible use of AI in expediting clinical workflows.</span>

                              <span>Visual AI systems are vulnerable to natural and synthetic physical corruption
in the real-world. Such corruption often arises unexpectedly and alters the
model&#x27;s performance. In recent years, the primary focus has been on adversarial
attacks. However, natural corruptions (e.g., snow, fog, dust) are an
omnipresent threat to visual AI systems and should be considered equally
important. Many existing works propose interesting solutions to train robust
models against natural corruption. These works either leverage image
augmentations, which come with the additional cost of model training, or place
suspicious patches in the scene to design unadversarial examples. In this work,
we propose the idea of naturalistic support artifacts (NSA) for robust
prediction. The NSAs are shown to be beneficial in scenarios where model
parameters are inaccessible and adding artifacts in the scene is feasible. The
NSAs are natural looking objects generated through artifact training using
DC-GAN to have high visual fidelity in the scene. We test against natural
corruptions on the Imagenette dataset and observe the improvement in prediction
confidence score by four times. We also demonstrate NSA&#x27;s capability to
increase adversarial accuracy by 8\% on average. Lastly, we qualitatively
analyze NSAs using saliency maps to understand how they help improve prediction
confidence.</span>

                              <span>With the development of Big data technology, data analysis has become
increasingly important. Traditional clustering algorithms such as K-means are
highly sensitive to the initial centroid selection and perform poorly on
non-convex datasets. In this paper, we address these problems by proposing a
data-driven Bregman divergence parameter optimization clustering algorithm
(DBGSA), which combines the Universal Gravitational Algorithm to bring similar
points closer in the dataset. We construct a gravitational coefficient equation
with a special property that gradually reduces the influence factor as the
iteration progresses. Furthermore, we introduce the Bregman divergence
generalized power mean information loss minimization to identify cluster
centers and build a hyperparameter identification optimization model, which
effectively solves the problems of manual adjustment and uncertainty in the
improved dataset. Extensive experiments are conducted on four simulated
datasets and six real datasets. The results demonstrate that DBGSA
significantly improves the accuracy of various clustering algorithms by an
average of 63.8\% compared to other similar approaches like enhanced clustering
algorithms and improved datasets. Additionally, a three-dimensional grid search
was established to compare the effects of different parameter values within
threshold conditions, and it was discovered the parameter set provided by our
model is optimal. This finding provides strong evidence of the high accuracy
and robustness of the algorithm.</span>

processing capacity (IPC), a normalized measure of the expected squared error
of a collection of signals to a complete basis of functions. We use the IPC to
measure the degradation under noise of the performance of reservoir computers,
a particular kind of recurrent network, when constrained by physical
considerations. First, we show that the IPC is at most a polynomial in the
system size $n$, even when considering the collection of $2^n$ possible
pointwise products of the $n$ output signals. Next, we argue that this
degradation implies that the family of functions represented by the reservoir
requires an exponential number of samples to learn in the presence of the
reservoir&#x27;s noise. Finally, we conclude with a discussion of the performance of
the same collection of $2^n$ functions without noise when being used for binary

                              <span>Neural operations that rely on neighborhood information are much more
expensive when deployed on point clouds than on grid data due to the irregular
distances between points in a point cloud. In a grid, on the other hand, we can
compute the kernel only once and reuse it for all query positions. As a result,
operations that rely on neighborhood information scale much worse for point
clouds than for grid data, specially for large inputs and large neighborhoods.

In this work, we address the scalability issue of point cloud methods by
tackling its root cause: the irregularity of the data. We propose learnable
gridification as the first step in a point cloud processing pipeline to
transform the point cloud into a compact, regular grid. Thanks to
gridification, subsequent layers can use operations defined on regular grids,
e.g., Conv3D, which scale much better than native point cloud methods. We then
extend gridification to point cloud to point cloud tasks, e.g., segmentation,
by adding a learnable de-gridification step at the end of the point cloud
processing pipeline to map the compact, regular grid back to its original point
cloud form. Through theoretical and empirical analysis, we show that gridified
networks scale better in terms of memory and time than networks directly
applied on raw point cloud data, while being able to achieve competitive
results. Our code is publicly available at

data-driven decisions. However, many of them capture empirical associations
that might be spurious due to confounding factors and subgroup heterogeneity.
The famous Simpson&#x27;s paradox is such a phenomenon where aggregated and
subgroup-level associations contradict with each other, causing cognitive
confusions and difficulty in making adequate interpretations and decisions.
Existing tools provide little insights for humans to locate, reason about, and
prevent pitfalls of spurious association in practice. We propose VISPUR, a
visual analytic system that provides a causal analysis framework and a
human-centric workflow for tackling spurious associations. These include a
CONFOUNDER DASHBOARD, which can automatically identify possible confounding
factors, and a SUBGROUP VIEWER, which allows for the visualization and
comparison of diverse subgroup patterns that likely or potentially result in a
misinterpretation of causality. Additionally, we propose a REASONING
STORYBOARD, which uses a flow-based approach to illustrate paradoxical
phenomena, as well as an interactive DECISION DIAGNOSIS panel that helps ensure
accountable decision-making. Through an expert interview and a controlled user
experiment, our qualitative and quantitative results demonstrate that the
proposed &quot;de-paradox&quot; workflow and the designed visual analytic system are
effective in helping human users to identify and understand spurious
associations, as well as to make accountable causal decisions.</span>

to hyperplanes in the domain of the function. We prove a conjecture of Ongie et

of infinite width neural network is expressible as a finite width shallow ReLU

                              <span>Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been shown to both extract more
information than the traditional two-point statistics from cosmological fields,
and marginalise over astrophysical effects extremely well. However, CNNs
require large amounts of training data, which is potentially problematic in the
domain of expensive cosmological simulations, and it is difficult to interpret
the network. In this work we apply the learnable scattering transform, a kind
of convolutional neural network that uses trainable wavelets as filters, to the
problem of cosmological inference and marginalisation over astrophysical
effects. We present two models based on the scattering transform, one
constructed for performance, and one constructed for interpretability, and
perform a comparison with a CNN. We find that scattering architectures are able
to outperform a CNN, significantly in the case of small training data samples.
Additionally we present a lightweight scattering network that is highly
interpretable.</span>

                              <span>This study provides a comprehensive time series analysis of daily
industry-specific, country-wise CO$_2$ emissions from January 2019 to February
2023. The research focuses on the Power, Industry, Ground Transport, Domestic
Aviation, and International Aviation sectors in European countries (EU27 &amp; UK,
Italy, Germany, Spain) and India, utilizing near-real-time activity data from
the Carbon Monitor research initiative. To identify regular emission patterns,
the data from the year 2020 is excluded due to the disruptive effects caused by
the COVID-19 pandemic. The study then performs a principal component analysis
(PCA) to determine the key contributors to CO$_2$ emissions. The analysis
reveals that the Power, Industry, and Ground Transport sectors account for a
significant portion of the variance in the dataset. A 7-day moving averaged
dataset is employed for further analysis to facilitate robust predictions. This
dataset captures both short-term and long-term trends and enhances the quality
of the data for prediction purposes. The study utilizes Long Short-Term Memory
(LSTM) models on the 7-day moving averaged dataset to effectively predict
emissions and provide insights for policy decisions, mitigation strategies, and
climate change efforts. During the training phase, the stability and
convergence of the LSTM models are ensured, which guarantees their reliability
in the testing phase. The evaluation of the loss function indicates this
reliability. The model achieves high efficiency, as demonstrated by $R^2$
values ranging from 0.8242 to 0.995 for various countries and sectors.
Furthermore, there is a proposal for utilizing scandium and
boron/aluminium-based thin films as exceptionally efficient materials for
capturing CO$_2$ (with a binding energy range from -3.0 to -3.5 eV). These
materials are shown to surpass the affinity of graphene and boron nitride
sheets in this regard.</span>

relationships between sets of objects. With the ubiquity of available network
data, there is increasing industrial and academic need to quickly analyze
graphs with billions of nodes and trillions of edges. A common first step for
network understanding is Graph Embedding, the process of creating a continuous
representation of nodes in a graph. A continuous representation is often more
amenable, especially at scale, for solving downstream machine learning tasks

received a lot of attention. However, most existing methods adopt pure
data-driven black-box models, which have limited accuracy and interpretability.
By combining trainable difference operators with black-box models, we propose a
new hybrid architecture explicitly embedded with partial prior knowledge of the
underlying PDEs named PDE-Net++. Furthermore, we introduce two distinct options
called the trainable flipping difference layer (TFDL) and the trainable dynamic

and better extrapolation performance than black-box models.</span>

                              <span>Recent work in the field of speech enhancement (SE) has involved the use of
self-supervised speech representations (SSSRs) as feature transformations in
loss functions. However, in prior work, very little attention has been paid to
the relationship between the language of the audio used to train the
self-supervised representation and that used to train the SE system.
Enhancement models trained using a loss function which incorporates a
self-supervised representation that shares exactly the language of the noisy
data used to train the SE system show better performance than those which do
not match exactly. This may lead to enhancement systems which are language
specific and as such do not generalise well to unseen languages, unlike models
trained using traditional spectrogram or time domain loss functions. In this
work, SE models are trained and tested on a number of different languages, with
self-supervised representations which themselves are trained using different
language combinations and with differing network structures as loss function
representations. These models are then tested across unseen languages and their
performances are analysed. It is found that the training language of the
self-supervised representation appears to have a minor effect on enhancement
performance, the amount of training data of a particular language, however,
greatly affects performance.</span>

                              <span>Distributionally Robust Optimization (DRO), which aims to find an optimal
decision that minimizes the worst case cost over the ambiguity set of
probability distribution, has been widely applied in diverse applications,
e.g., network behavior analysis, risk management, etc. However, existing DRO
techniques face three key challenges: 1) how to deal with the asynchronous
updating in a distributed environment; 2) how to leverage the prior
distribution effectively; 3) how to properly adjust the degree of robustness
according to different scenarios. To this end, we propose an asynchronous
distributed algorithm, named Asynchronous Single-looP alternatIve gRadient
projEction (ASPIRE) algorithm with the itErative Active SEt method (EASE) to
tackle the federated distributionally robust optimization (FDRO) problem.
Furthermore, a new uncertainty set, i.e., constrained D-norm uncertainty set,
is developed to effectively leverage the prior distribution and flexibly
control the degree of robustness. Finally, our theoretical analysis elucidates
that the proposed algorithm is guaranteed to converge and the iteration
complexity is also analyzed. Extensive empirical studies on real-world datasets
demonstrate that the proposed method can not only achieve fast convergence, and
remain robust against data heterogeneity as well as malicious attacks, but also
tradeoff robustness with performance.</span>

                              <span>Recent work has shown that Machine Learning (ML) programs are error-prone and
called for contracts for ML code. Contracts, as in the design by contract
methodology, help document APIs and aid API users in writing correct code. The
question is: what kinds of contracts would provide the most help to API users?
We are especially interested in what kinds of contracts help API users catch
errors at earlier stages in the ML pipeline. We describe an empirical study of
posts on Stack Overflow of the four most often-discussed ML libraries:
TensorFlow, Scikit-learn, Keras, and PyTorch. For these libraries, our study
extracted 413 informal (English) API specifications. We used these
specifications to understand the following questions. What are the root causes
and effects behind ML contract violations? Are there common patterns of ML
contract violations? When does understanding ML contracts require an advanced
level of ML software expertise? Could checking contracts at the API level help
detect the violations in early ML pipeline stages? Our key findings are that
the most commonly needed contracts for ML APIs are either checking constraints
on single arguments of an API or on the order of API calls. The software
engineering community could employ existing contract mining approaches to mine
these contracts to promote an increased understanding of ML APIs. We also noted
a need to combine behavioral and temporal contract mining approaches. We report
on categories of required ML contracts, which may help designers of contract
languages.</span>

the inherently slow acquisition process creates the necessity of reconstruction
approaches for accelerated undersampled acquisitions. Several regularization
approaches that exploit spatial-temporal redundancy have been proposed to
reconstruct undersampled cardiac cine MRI. More recently, methods based on
supervised deep learning have been also proposed to further accelerate
acquisition and reconstruction. However, these techniques rely on usually large
dataset for training, which are not always available. In this work, we propose
an unsupervised approach based on implicit neural field representations for
cardiac cine MRI (so called NF-cMRI). The proposed method was evaluated in
in-vivo undersampled golden-angle radial multi-coil acquisitions for

science. Its applications can be found in various fields, from protein modeling
to social network analysis. Recently, many papers appeared studying the problem
of overlapping community detection, where each node of a network may belong to
several communities. In this work, we consider Mixed-Membership Stochastic
Block Model (MMSB) first proposed by Airoldi et al. (2008). MMSB provides quite
a general setting for modeling overlapping community structure in graphs. The
central question of this paper is to reconstruct relations between communities
given an observed network. We compare different approaches and establish the
minimax lower bound on the estimation error. Then, we propose a new estimator
that matches this lower bound. Theoretical results are proved under fairly
general conditions on the considered model. Finally, we illustrate the theory

                              <span>In machine learning, generative modeling aims to learn to generate new data
statistically similar to the training data distribution. In this paper, we
survey learning generative models under limited data, few shots and zero shot,
referred to as Generative Modeling under Data Constraint (GM-DC). This is an
important topic when data acquisition is challenging, e.g. healthcare
applications. We discuss background, challenges, and propose two taxonomies:
one on GM-DC tasks and another on GM-DC approaches. Importantly, we study
interactions between different GM-DC tasks and approaches. Furthermore, we
highlight research gaps, research trends, and potential avenues for future
exploration. Project website: https://gmdc-survey.github.io.</span>

                              <span>The regression of a functional response on a set of scalar predictors can be
a challenging task, especially if there is a large number of predictors, or the
relationship between those predictors and the response is nonlinear. In this
work, we propose a solution to this problem: a feed-forward neural network (NN)
designed to predict a functional response using scalar inputs. First, we
transform the functional response to a finite-dimensional representation and
construct an NN that outputs this representation. Then, we propose to modify
the output of an NN via the objective function and introduce different
objective functions for network training. The proposed models are suited for
both regularly and irregularly spaced data, and a roughness penalty can be
further applied to control the smoothness of the predicted curve. The
difficulty in implementing both those features lies in the definition of
objective functions that can be back-propagated. In our experiments, we
demonstrate that our model outperforms the conventional function-on-scalar
regression model in multiple scenarios while computationally scaling better
with the dimension of the predictors.</span>

                              <span>In this work, we explore a framework for contextual decision-making to study
how the relevance and quantity of past data affects the performance of a
data-driven policy. We analyze a contextual Newsvendor problem in which a
decision-maker needs to trade-off between an underage and an overage cost in
the face of uncertain demand. We consider a setting in which past demands
observed under &#x60;&#x60;close by&#x27;&#x27; contexts come from close by distributions and
analyze the performance of data-driven algorithms through a notion of
context-dependent worst-case expected regret. We analyze the broad class of
Weighted Empirical Risk Minimization (WERM) policies which weigh past data
according to their similarity in the contextual space. This class includes
classical policies such as ERM, k-Nearest Neighbors and kernel-based policies.
Our main methodological contribution is to characterize exactly the worst-case
regret of any WERM policy on any given configuration of contexts. To the best
of our knowledge, this provides the first understanding of tight performance
guarantees in any contextual decision-making problem, with past literature
focusing on upper bounds via concentration inequalities. We instead take an
optimization approach, and isolate a structure in the Newsvendor loss function
that allows to reduce the infinite-dimensional optimization problem over
worst-case distributions to a simple line search.

This in turn allows us to unveil fundamental insights that were obfuscated by
previous general-purpose bounds. We characterize actual guaranteed performance
as a function of the contexts, as well as granular insights on the learning
curve of algorithms.</span>

                              <span>We propose FLARE, the first fingerprinting mechanism to verify whether a
suspected Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) policy is an illegitimate copy of
another (victim) policy. We first show that it is possible to find
non-transferable, universal adversarial masks, i.e., perturbations, to generate
adversarial examples that can successfully transfer from a victim policy to its
modified versions but not to independently trained policies. FLARE employs
these masks as fingerprints to verify the true ownership of stolen DRL policies
by measuring an action agreement value over states perturbed via such masks.
Our empirical evaluations show that FLARE is effective (100% action agreement
on stolen copies) and does not falsely accuse independent policies (no false
positives). FLARE is also robust to model modification attacks and cannot be
easily evaded by more informed adversaries without negatively impacting agent
performance. We also show that not all universal adversarial masks are suitable
candidates for fingerprints due to the inherent characteristics of DRL
policies. The spatio-temporal dynamics of DRL problems and sequential
decision-making process make characterizing the decision boundary of DRL
policies more difficult, as well as searching for universal masks that capture
the geometry of it.</span>

                              <span>Deep edge intelligence aims to deploy deep learning models that demand
computationally expensive training in the edge network with limited
computational power. Moreover, many deep edge intelligence applications require
handling distributed data that cannot be transferred to a central server due to
privacy concerns. Decentralized learning methods, such as federated learning,
offer solutions where models are learned collectively by exchanging learned
weights. However, they often require complex models that edge devices may not
handle and multiple rounds of network communication to achieve state-of-the-art
performances. This study proposes a convolutional ensemble learning approach,
coined EdgeConvEns, that facilitates training heterogeneous weak models on edge
and learning to ensemble them where data on edge are heterogeneously
distributed. Edge models are implemented and trained independently on
Field-Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) devices with various computational
capacities. Learned data representations are transferred to a central server
where the ensemble model is trained with the learned features received from the
edge devices to boost the overall prediction performance. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that the EdgeConvEns can outperform the state-of-the-art
performance with fewer communications and less data in various training
scenarios.</span>

                              <span>Ranking functions that are used in decision systems often produce disparate
results for different populations because of bias in the underlying data.
Addressing, and compensating for, these disparate outcomes is a critical
problem for fair decision-making. Recent compensatory measures have mostly
focused on opaque transformations of the ranking functions to satisfy fairness
guarantees or on the use of quotas or set-asides to guarantee a minimum number
of positive outcomes to members of underrepresented groups. In this paper we
propose easily explainable data-driven compensatory measures for ranking
functions. Our measures rely on the generation of bonus points given to members
of underrepresented groups to address disparity in the ranking function. The
bonus points can be set in advance, and can be combined, allowing for
considering the intersections of representations and giving better transparency
to stakeholders. We propose efficient sampling-based algorithms to calculate
the number of bonus points to minimize disparity. We validate our algorithms
using real-world school admissions and recidivism datasets, and compare our
results with that of existing fair ranking algorithms.</span>

perform learning and inference on graph-structured data. However, little work
has been done to understand the fundamental limitations of GNNs for scaling to
larger graphs and generalizing to out-of-distribution (OOD) inputs. In this
paper, we use a random graph generator to systematically investigate how the
graph size and structural properties affect the predictive performance of GNNs.
We present specific evidence that the average node degree is a key feature in
determining whether GNNs can generalize to unseen graphs, and that the use of
multiple node update functions can improve the generalization performance of
GNNs when dealing with graphs of multimodal degree distributions. Accordingly,
we propose a multi-module GNN framework that allows the network to adapt
flexibly to new graphs by generalizing a single canonical nonlinear
transformation over aggregated inputs. Our results show that the multi-module
GNNs improve the OOD generalization on a variety of inference tasks in the

                              <span>Because &quot;out-of-the-box&quot; large language models are capable of generating a
great deal of objectionable content, recent work has focused on aligning these
models in an attempt to prevent undesirable generation. While there has been
some success at circumventing these measures -- so-called &quot;jailbreaks&quot; against
LLMs -- these attacks have required significant human ingenuity and are brittle
in practice. In this paper, we propose a simple and effective attack method
that causes aligned language models to generate objectionable behaviors.
Specifically, our approach finds a suffix that, when attached to a wide range
of queries for an LLM to produce objectionable content, aims to maximize the
probability that the model produces an affirmative response (rather than
refusing to answer). However, instead of relying on manual engineering, our
approach automatically produces these adversarial suffixes by a combination of
greedy and gradient-based search techniques, and also improves over past
automatic prompt generation methods.

Surprisingly, we find that the adversarial prompts generated by our approach
are quite transferable, including to black-box, publicly released LLMs.
Specifically, we train an adversarial attack suffix on multiple prompts (i.e.,
queries asking for many different types of objectionable content), as well as
multiple models (in our case, Vicuna-7B and 13B). When doing so, the resulting
attack suffix is able to induce objectionable content in the public interfaces
to ChatGPT, Bard, and Claude, as well as open source LLMs such as LLaMA-2-Chat,
Pythia, Falcon, and others. In total, this work significantly advances the
state-of-the-art in adversarial attacks against aligned language models,
raising important questions about how such systems can be prevented from
producing objectionable information. Code is available at

                              <span>Semantic inpainting or image completion alludes to the task of inferring
arbitrary large missing regions in images based on image semantics. Since the
prediction of image pixels requires an indication of high-level context, this
makes it significantly tougher than image completion, which is often more
concerned with correcting data corruption and removing entire objects from the
input image. On the other hand, image enhancement attempts to eliminate
unwanted noise and blur from the image, along with sustaining most of the image
details. Efficient image completion and enhancement model should be able to
recover the corrupted and masked regions in images and then refine the image
further to increase the quality of the output image. Generative Adversarial
Networks (GAN), have turned out to be helpful in picture completion tasks. In
this chapter, we will discuss the underlying GAN architecture and how they can
be used used for image completion tasks.</span>

mechanisms that cope with uncertainty to foresee the future. In this paper, we
propose a multi-stage probabilistic approach for trajectory forecasting:
trajectory transformation to displacement space, clustering of displacement
time series, trajectory proposals, and ranking proposals. We introduce a new
deep feature clustering method, underlying self-conditioned GAN, which copes
better with distribution shifts than traditional methods. Additionally, we
propose novel distance-based ranking proposals to assign probabilities to the
generated trajectories that are more efficient yet accurate than an auxiliary

                              <span>Deep learning often faces the challenge of efficiently processing dynamic
inputs, such as sensor data or user inputs. For example, an AI writing
assistant is required to update its suggestions in real time as a document is
edited. Re-running the model each time is expensive, even with compression
techniques like knowledge distillation, pruning, or quantization. Instead, we
take an incremental computing approach, looking to reuse calculations as the
inputs change. However, the dense connectivity of conventional architectures
poses a major obstacle to incremental computation, as even minor input changes
cascade through the network and restrict information reuse. To address this, we
use vector quantization to discretize intermediate values in the network, which
filters out noisy and unnecessary modifications to hidden neurons, facilitating
the reuse of their values. We apply this approach to the transformers
architecture, creating an efficient incremental inference algorithm with
complexity proportional to the fraction of the modified inputs. Our experiments
with adapting the OPT-125M pre-trained language model demonstrate comparable
accuracy on document classification while requiring 12.1X (median) fewer
operations for processing sequences of atomic edits.</span>

                              <span>Normalising Flows are generative models characterised by their invertible
architecture. However, the requirement of invertibility imposes constraints on
their expressiveness, necessitating a large number of parameters and innovative
architectural designs to achieve satisfactory outcomes. Whilst flow-based
models predominantly rely on neural-network-based transformations for
expressive designs, alternative transformation methods have received limited
attention. In this work, we present Ferumal flow, a novel kernelised
normalising flow paradigm that integrates kernels into the framework. Our
results demonstrate that a kernelised flow can yield competitive or superior
results compared to neural network-based flows whilst maintaining parameter
efficiency. Kernelised flows excel especially in the low-data regime, enabling
flexible non-parametric density estimation in applications with sparse data

                              <span>Data profiling is an essential process in modern data-driven industries. One
of its critical components is the discovery and validation of complex
statistics, including functional dependencies, data constraints, association
rules, and others.

However, most existing data profiling systems that focus on complex
statistics do not provide proper integration with the tools used by
contemporary data scientists. This creates a significant barrier to the
adoption of these tools in the industry. Moreover, existing systems were not
created with industrial-grade workloads in mind. Finally, they do not aim to
provide descriptive explanations, i.e. why a given pattern is not found. It is
a significant issue as it is essential to understand the underlying reasons for
a specific pattern&#x27;s absence to make informed decisions based on the data.

Because of that, these patterns are effectively rest in thin air: their
application scope is rather limited, they are rarely used by the broader
public. At the same time, as we are going to demonstrate in this presentation,
complex statistics can be efficiently used to solve many classic data quality
problems.

Desbordante is an open-source data profiler that aims to close this gap. It
is built with emphasis on industrial application: it is efficient, scalable,
resilient to crashes, and provides explanations. Furthermore, it provides
seamless Python integration by offloading various costly operations to the C++
core, not only mining.

In this demonstration, we show several scenarios that allow end users to
solve different data quality problems. Namely, we showcase typo detection, data
deduplication, and data anomaly detection scenarios.</span>

                              <span>As the network scale increases, existing fully distributed solutions start to
lag behind the real-world challenges such as (1) slow information propagation,
(2) network communication failures, and (3) external adversarial attacks. In
this paper, we focus on hierarchical system architecture and address the
problem of non-Bayesian learning over networks that are vulnerable to
communication failures and adversarial attacks. On network communication, we
consider packet-dropping link failures.

We first propose a hierarchical robust push-sum algorithm that can achieve
average consensus despite frequent packet-dropping link failures. We provide a
sparse information fusion rule between the parameter server and arbitrarily
selected network representatives. Then, interleaving the consensus update step
with a dual averaging update with Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence as the
proximal function, we obtain a packet-dropping fault-tolerant non-Bayesian
learning algorithm with provable convergence guarantees.

On external adversarial attacks, we consider Byzantine attacks in which the
compromised agents can send maliciously calibrated messages to others
(including both the agents and the parameter server). To avoid the curse of
dimensionality of Byzantine consensus, we solve the non-Bayesian learning
problem via running multiple dynamics, each of which only involves Byzantine
consensus with scalar inputs. To facilitate resilient information propagation
across sub-networks, we use a novel Byzantine-resilient gossiping-type rule at
the parameter server.</span>

                              <span>Purpose: This study evaluated the out-of-domain performance and
generalization capabilities of automated medical image segmentation models,
with a particular focus on adaptation to new image acquisitions and disease
type.

Materials: Datasets from both non-contrast and contrast-enhanced abdominal CT
scans of healthy patients and those with polycystic kidney disease (PKD) were
used. A total of 400 images (100 non-contrast controls, 100 contrast controls,
100 non-contrast PKD, 100 contrast PKD) were utilized for training/validation
of models to segment kidneys, livers, and spleens, and the final models were
then tested on 100 non-contrast CT images of patients affected by PKD.
Performance was evaluated using Dice, Jaccard, TPR, and Precision.

Results: Models trained on a diverse range of data showed no worse
performance than models trained exclusively on in-domain data when tested on
in-domain data. For instance, the Dice similarity of the model trained on 25%
from each dataset was found to be non-inferior to the model trained purely on
in-domain data.

Conclusions: The results indicate that broader training examples
significantly enhances model generalization and out-of-domain performance,
thereby improving automated segmentation tools&#x27; applicability in clinical
settings. The study&#x27;s findings provide a roadmap for future research to adopt a
data-centric approach in medical image AI model development.</span>

                              <span>We propose a theoretical framework for studying the imitation of stochastic,
non-Markovian, potentially multi-modal (i.e. &quot;complex&quot; ) expert demonstrations
in nonlinear dynamical systems. Our framework invokes low-level controllers -
either learned or implicit in position-command control - to stabilize imitation
policies around expert demonstrations. We show that with (a) a suitable
low-level stability guarantee and (b) a stochastic continuity property of the
learned policy we call &quot;total variation continuity&quot; (TVC), an imitator that
accurately estimates actions on the demonstrator&#x27;s state distribution closely
matches the demonstrator&#x27;s distribution over entire trajectories. We then show
that TVC can be ensured with minimal degradation of accuracy by combining a
popular data-augmentation regimen with a novel algorithmic trick: adding
augmentation noise at execution time. We instantiate our guarantees for
policies parameterized by diffusion models and prove that if the learner
accurately estimates the score of the (noise-augmented) expert policy, then the
distribution of imitator trajectories is close to the demonstrator distribution
in a natural optimal transport distance. Our analysis constructs intricate
couplings between noise-augmented trajectories, a technique that may be of
independent interest. We conclude by empirically validating our algorithmic
recommendations.</span>

                              <span>In latest years, deep learning has gained a leading role in the pansharpening
of multiresolution images. Given the lack of ground truth data, most deep
learning-based methods carry out supervised training in a reduced-resolution
domain. However, models trained on downsized images tend to perform poorly on
high-resolution target images. For this reason, several research groups are now
turning to unsupervised training in the full-resolution domain, through the
definition of appropriate loss functions and training paradigms. In this
context, we have recently proposed a full-resolution training framework which
can be applied to many existing architectures.

Here, we propose a new deep learning-based pansharpening model that fully
exploits the potential of this approach and provides cutting-edge performance.
Besides architectural improvements with respect to previous work, such as the
use of residual attention modules, the proposed model features a novel loss
function that jointly promotes the spectral and spatial quality of the
pansharpened data. In addition, thanks to a new fine-tuning strategy, it
improves inference-time adaptation to target images. Experiments on a large
variety of test images, performed in challenging scenarios, demonstrate that
the proposed method compares favorably with the state of the art both in terms
of numerical results and visual output. Code is available online at

electrical activity of the brain. This exam is used to help diagnose conditions
such as different brain problems. EEG signals are taken for the purpose of
epilepsy detection and with Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) and machine
learning classifier, they perform epilepsy detection. In Epilepsy seizure
detection, mainly machine learning classifiers and statistical features are
used. The hidden information in the EEG signal is useful for detecting diseases
affecting the brain. Sometimes it is very difficult to identify the minimum
changes in the EEG in the time and frequency domains purpose. The DWT can give
a good decomposition of the signals in different frequency bands and feature
extraction. We use the tri-dimensionality reduction algorithm.; Principal
Component Analysis (PCA), Independent Component Analysis (ICA), and Linear
Discriminant Analysis (LDA). Finally, features are selected by using a fusion
rule and at the last step three different classifiers Support Vector Machine

                              <span>Multi-Task Learning (MTL) aims to learn multiple tasks simultaneously while
exploiting their mutual relationships. By using shared resources to
simultaneously calculate multiple outputs, this learning paradigm has the
potential to have lower memory requirements and inference times compared to the
traditional approach of using separate methods for each task. Previous work in
MTL has mainly focused on fully-supervised methods, as task relationships can
not only be leveraged to lower the level of data-dependency of those methods
but they can also improve performance. However, MTL introduces a set of
challenges due to a complex optimisation scheme and a higher labeling
requirement. This review focuses on how MTL could be utilised under different
partial supervision settings to address these challenges. First, this review
analyses how MTL traditionally uses different parameter sharing techniques to
transfer knowledge in between tasks. Second, it presents the different
challenges arising from such a multi-objective optimisation scheme. Third, it
introduces how task groupings can be achieved by analysing task relationships.
Fourth, it focuses on how partially supervised methods applied to MTL can
tackle the aforementioned challenges. Lastly, this review presents the
available datasets, tools and benchmarking results of such methods.</span>

Additionally, we define the existing architectures for models with rejection

                              <span>The isomorphism problem is a fundamental problem in network analysis, which
involves capturing both low-order and high-order structural information. In
terms of extracting low-order structural information, graph isomorphism
algorithms analyze the structural equivalence to reduce the solver space
dimension, which demonstrates its power in many applications, such as protein
design, chemical pathways, and community detection. For the more commonly
occurring high-order relationships in real-life scenarios, the problem of
hypergraph isomorphism, which effectively captures these high-order structural
relationships, cannot be straightforwardly addressed using graph isomorphism
methods. Besides, the existing hypergraph kernel methods may suffer from high
memory consumption or inaccurate sub-structure identification, thus yielding
sub-optimal performance. In this paper, to address the abovementioned problems,
we first propose the hypergraph Weisfiler-Lehman test algorithm for the
hypergraph isomorphism test problem by generalizing the Weisfiler-Lehman test
algorithm from graphs to hypergraphs. Secondly, based on the presented
algorithm, we propose a general hypergraph Weisfieler-Lehman kernel framework
and implement two instances, which are Hypergraph Weisfeiler-Lehamn Subtree
Kernel and Hypergraph Weisfeiler-Lehamn Hyperedge Kernel. In order to fulfill
our research objectives, a comprehensive set of experiments was meticulously
designed, including seven graph classification datasets and 12 hypergraph
classification datasets. Results on hypergraph classification datasets show
significant improvements compared to other typical kernel-based methods, which
demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed methods. In our evaluation, we
found that our proposed methods outperform the second-best method in terms of
runtime, running over 80 times faster when handling complex hypergraph

                              <span>Mobile edge computing (MEC) is essential for next-generation mobile network
applications that prioritize various performance metrics, including delays and
energy consumption. However, conventional single-objective scheduling solutions
cannot be directly applied to practical systems in which the preferences of
these applications (i.e., the weights of different objectives) are often
unknown or challenging to specify in advance. In this study, we address this
issue by formulating a multi-objective offloading problem for MEC with multiple
edges to minimize expected long-term energy consumption and transmission delay
while considering unknown preferences as parameters. To address the challenge
of unknown preferences, we design a multi-objective (deep) reinforcement
learning (MORL)-based resource scheduling scheme with proximal policy
optimization (PPO). In addition, we introduce a well-designed state encoding
method for constructing features for multiple edges in MEC systems, a
sophisticated reward function for accurately computing the utilities of delay
and energy consumption. Simulation results demonstrate that our proposed MORL
scheme enhances the hypervolume of the Pareto front by up to 233.1% compared to
benchmarks. Our full framework is available at

                              <span>Optimization methods are essential in solving complex problems across various
domains. In this research paper, we introduce a novel optimization method
called Gaussian Crunching Search (GCS). Inspired by the behaviour of particles
in a Gaussian distribution, GCS aims to efficiently explore the solution space
and converge towards the global optimum. We present a comprehensive analysis of
GCS, including its working mechanism, and potential applications. Through
experimental evaluations and comparisons with existing optimization methods, we
highlight the advantages and strengths of GCS. This research paper serves as a
valuable resource for researchers, practitioners, and students interested in
optimization, providing insights into the development and potential of Gaussian
Crunching Search as a new and promising approach.</span>

                              <span>Deep-learning models for traffic data prediction can have superior
performance in modeling complex functions using a multi-layer architecture.
However, a major drawback of these approaches is that most of these approaches
do not offer forecasts with uncertainty estimates, which are essential for
traffic operations and control. Without uncertainty estimates, it is difficult
to place any level of trust to the model predictions, and operational
strategies relying on overconfident predictions can lead to worsening traffic
conditions. In this study, we propose a Bayesian recurrent neural network
framework for uncertainty quantification in traffic prediction with higher
generalizability by introducing spectral normalization to its hidden layers. In
our paper, we have shown that normalization alters the training process of deep
neural networks by controlling the model&#x27;s complexity and reducing the risk of
overfitting to the training data. This, in turn, helps improve the
generalization performance of the model on out-of-distribution datasets.
Results demonstrate that spectral normalization improves uncertainty estimates
and significantly outperforms both the layer normalization and model without
normalization in single-step prediction horizons. This improved performance can
be attributed to the ability of spectral normalization to better localize the
feature space of the data under perturbations. Our findings are especially
relevant to traffic management applications, where predicting traffic
conditions across multiple locations is the goal, but the availability of
training data from multiple locations is limited. Spectral normalization,
therefore, provides a more generalizable approach that can effectively capture
the underlying patterns in traffic data without requiring location-specific
models.</span>

automates Bayesian model averaging, selection, and combination by message
passing on a Forney-style factor graph with a custom mixture node. Parameter
and state inference, and model comparison can then be executed simultaneously
using message passing with scale factors. This approach shortens the model

                              <span>Algorithmic Gaussianization is a phenomenon that can arise when using
randomized sketching or sampling methods to produce smaller representations of
large datasets: For certain tasks, these sketched representations have been
observed to exhibit many robust performance characteristics that are known to
occur when a data sample comes from a sub-gaussian random design, which is a
powerful statistical model of data distributions. However, this phenomenon has
only been studied for specific tasks and metrics, or by relying on
computationally expensive methods. We address this by providing an algorithmic
framework for gaussianizing data distributions via averaging, proving that it
is possible to efficiently construct data sketches that are nearly
indistinguishable (in terms of total variation distance) from sub-gaussian
random designs. In particular, relying on a recently introduced sketching
technique called Leverage Score Sparsified (LESS) embeddings, we show that one
can construct an $n\times d$ sketch of an $N\times d$ matrix $A$, where $n\ll
N$, that is nearly indistinguishable from a sub-gaussian design, in time
$O(\text{nnz}(A)\log N + nd^2)$, where $\text{nnz}(A)$ is the number of
non-zero entries in $A$. As a consequence, strong statistical guarantees and
precise asymptotics available for the estimators produced from sub-gaussian
designs (e.g., for least squares and Lasso regression, covariance estimation,
low-rank approximation, etc.) can be straightforwardly adapted to our sketching
framework. We illustrate this with a new approximation guarantee for sketched
least squares, among other examples.</span>

estimates. They are fast, likelihood free and, due to their amortised nature,
amenable to fast bootstrap-based uncertainty quantification. In this paper, we
aim to increase the awareness of statisticians to this relatively new
inferential tool, and to facilitate its adoption by providing user-friendly
open-source software. We also give attention to the ubiquitous problem of
making inference from replicated data, which we address in the neural setting
using permutation-invariant neural networks. Through extensive simulation
studies we show that these neural point estimators can quickly and optimally
(in a Bayes sense) estimate parameters in weakly-identified and
highly-parameterised models with relative ease. We demonstrate their
applicability through an analysis of extreme sea-surface temperature in the Red
Sea where, after training, we obtain parameter estimates and bootstrap-based
confidence intervals from hundreds of spatial fields in a fraction of a second.</span>

                              <span>Data augmentation is a powerful technique to improve performance in
applications such as image and text classification tasks. Yet, there is little
rigorous understanding of why and how various augmentations work. In this work,
we consider a family of linear transformations and study their effects on the
ridge estimator in an over-parametrized linear regression setting. First, we
show that transformations that preserve the labels of the data can improve
estimation by enlarging the span of the training data. Second, we show that
transformations that mix data can improve estimation by playing a
regularization effect. Finally, we validate our theoretical insights on MNIST.
Based on the insights, we propose an augmentation scheme that searches over the
space of transformations by how uncertain the model is about the transformed
data. We validate our proposed scheme on image and text datasets. For example,
our method outperforms random sampling methods by 1.24% on CIFAR-100 using
Wide-ResNet-28-10. Furthermore, we achieve comparable accuracy to the SoTA
Adversarial AutoAugment on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, SVHN, and ImageNet datasets.</span>

architecture. However, the requirement of invertibility imposes constraints on
their expressiveness, necessitating a large number of parameters and innovative
architectural designs to achieve satisfactory outcomes. Whilst flow-based
models predominantly rely on neural-network-based transformations for
expressive designs, alternative transformation methods have received limited
attention. In this work, we present Ferumal flow, a novel kernelised

to mitigate data distribution shifts when transferring knowledge from multiple
labeled source domains to an unlabeled target domain. We propose a novel MSDA
framework based on dictionary learning and optimal transport. We interpret each
domain in MSDA as an empirical distribution. As such, we express each domain as
a Wasserstein barycenter of dictionary atoms, which are empirical
distributions. We propose a novel algorithm, DaDiL, for learning via
mini-batches: (i) atom distributions; (ii) a matrix of barycentric coordinates.
Based on our dictionary, we propose two novel methods for MSDA: DaDil-R, based
on the reconstruction of labeled samples in the target domain, and DaDiL-E,
based on the ensembling of classifiers learned on atom distributions. We
evaluate our methods in 3 benchmarks: Caltech-Office, Office 31, and CRWU,
where we improved previous state-of-the-art by 3.15%, 2.29%, and 7.71% in
classification performance. Finally, we show that interpolations in the

                              <span>Existing causal models for link prediction assume an underlying set of
inherent node factors -- an innate characteristic defined at the node&#x27;s birth
-- that governs the causal evolution of links in the graph. In some causal
tasks, however, link formation is path-dependent: The outcome of link
interventions depends on existing links. Unfortunately, these existing causal
methods are not designed for path-dependent link formation, as the cascading
functional dependencies between links (arising from path dependence) are either
unidentifiable or require an impractical number of control variables. To
overcome this, we develop the first causal model capable of dealing with path
dependencies in link prediction. In this work we introduce the concept of
causal lifting, an invariance in causal models of independent interest that, on
graphs, allows the identification of causal link prediction queries using
limited interventional data. Further, we show how structural pairwise
embeddings exhibit lower bias and correctly represent the task&#x27;s causal
structure, as opposed to existing node embeddings, e.g., graph neural network
node embeddings and matrix factorization. Finally, we validate our theoretical
findings on three scenarios for causal link prediction tasks: knowledge base
completion, covariance matrix estimation and consumer-product recommendations.</span>

innovative monitoring techniques which can operate in real time with low

Consequently, the learned relationship between the input and the output must
remain valid during the model&#x27;s deployment. If this stationarity assumption
holds, we can conclude that the ANN provides accurate predictions. Otherwise,
the retraining or rebuilding of the model is required. We propose considering
the latent feature representation of the data (called &quot;embedding&quot;) generated by

non-Markovian, potentially multi-modal (i.e. &quot;complex&quot; ) expert demonstrations
in nonlinear dynamical systems. Our framework invokes low-level controllers -
either learned or implicit in position-command control - to stabilize imitation
policies around expert demonstrations. We show that with (a) a suitable
low-level stability guarantee and (b) a stochastic continuity property of the
learned policy we call &quot;total variation continuity&quot; (TVC), an imitator that
accurately estimates actions on the demonstrator&#x27;s state distribution closely
matches the demonstrator&#x27;s distribution over entire trajectories. We then show
that TVC can be ensured with minimal degradation of accuracy by combining a
popular data-augmentation regimen with a novel algorithmic trick: adding
augmentation noise at execution time. We instantiate our guarantees for
policies parameterized by diffusion models and prove that if the learner
accurately estimates the score of the (noise-augmented) expert policy, then the
distribution of imitator trajectories is close to the demonstrator distribution
in a natural optimal transport distance. Our analysis constructs intricate

                              <span>State-of-the-art neural networks require extreme computational power to
train. It is therefore natural to wonder whether they are optimally trained.
Here we apply a recent advancement in stochastic thermodynamics which allows
bounding the speed at which one can go from the initial weight distribution to
the final distribution of the fully trained network, based on the ratio of
their Wasserstein-2 distance and the entropy production rate of the dynamical
process connecting them. Considering both gradient-flow and Langevin training
dynamics, we provide analytical expressions for these speed limits for linear
and linearizable neural networks e.g. Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK). Remarkably,
given some plausible scaling assumptions on the NTK spectra and spectral
decomposition of the labels -- learning is optimal in a scaling sense. Our
results are consistent with small-scale experiments with Convolutional Neural
Networks (CNNs) and Fully Connected Neural networks (FCNs) on CIFAR-10, showing
a short highly non-optimal regime followed by a longer optimal regime.</span>

a challenging task, especially if there is a large number of predictors, or the
relationship between those predictors and the response is nonlinear. In this
work, we propose a solution to this problem: a feed-forward neural network (NN)
designed to predict a functional response using scalar inputs. First, we
transform the functional response to a finite-dimensional representation and
construct an NN that outputs this representation. Then, we propose to modify
the output of an NN via the objective function and introduce different
objective functions for network training. The proposed models are suited for
both regularly and irregularly spaced data, and a roughness penalty can be
further applied to control the smoothness of the predicted curve. The
difficulty in implementing both those features lies in the definition of
objective functions that can be back-propagated. In our experiments, we
demonstrate that our model outperforms the conventional function-on-scalar

powerful modeling framework for identifying the temporal dynamics underlying
binary time series data, which arise in a variety of contexts such as binary
decision-making and discrete stochastic processes (e.g., binned neural spike
trains). Here we develop a spectral learning method for fast, efficient fitting
of probit-Bernoulli latent linear dynamical system (LDS) models. Our approach
extends traditional subspace identification methods to the Bernoulli setting
via a transformation of the first and second sample moments. This results in a
robust, fixed-cost estimator that avoids the hazards of local optima and the
long computation time of iterative fitting procedures like the
expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm. In regimes where data is limited or
assumptions about the statistical structure of the data are not met, we
demonstrate that the spectral estimate provides a good initialization for
Laplace-EM fitting. Finally, we show that the estimator provides substantial
benefits to real world settings by analyzing data from mice performing a

                              <span>Preserving training dynamics across batch sizes is an important tool for
practical machine learning as it enables the trade-off between batch size and
wall-clock time. This trade-off is typically enabled by a scaling rule, for
example, in stochastic gradient descent, one should scale the learning rate
linearly with the batch size. Another important tool for practical machine
learning is the model Exponential Moving Average (EMA), which is a model copy
that does not receive gradient information, but instead follows its target
model with some momentum. This model EMA can improve the robustness and
generalization properties of supervised learning, stabilize pseudo-labeling,
and provide a learning signal for Self-Supervised Learning (SSL). Prior works
have treated the model EMA separately from optimization, leading to different
training dynamics across batch sizes and lower model performance. In this work,
we provide a scaling rule for optimization in the presence of model EMAs and
demonstrate its validity across a range of architectures, optimizers, and data
modalities. We also show the rule&#x27;s validity where the model EMA contributes to
the optimization of the target model, enabling us to train EMA-based
pseudo-labeling and SSL methods at small and large batch sizes. For SSL, we

                              <span>This paper studies the estimation and inference of treatment histories in
panel data settings when treatments change dynamically over time.

We propose a method that allows for (i) treatments to be assigned dynamically
over time based on high-dimensional covariates, past outcomes and treatments;
(ii) outcomes and time-varying covariates to depend on treatment trajectories;
(iii) heterogeneity of treatment effects.

Our approach recursively projects potential outcomes&#x27; expectations on past
histories. It then controls the bias by balancing dynamically observable
characteristics. We study the asymptotic and numerical properties of the
estimator and illustrate the benefits of the procedure in an empirical
application.</span>

                              <span>Community detection is one of the most critical problems in modern network
science. Its applications can be found in various fields, from protein modeling
to social network analysis. Recently, many papers appeared studying the problem
of overlapping community detection, where each node of a network may belong to
several communities. In this work, we consider Mixed-Membership Stochastic
Block Model (MMSB) first proposed by Airoldi et al. (2008). MMSB provides quite
a general setting for modeling overlapping community structure in graphs. The
central question of this paper is to reconstruct relations between communities
given an observed network. We compare different approaches and establish the
minimax lower bound on the estimation error. Then, we propose a new estimator
that matches this lower bound. Theoretical results are proved under fairly
general conditions on the considered model. Finally, we illustrate the theory
in a series of experiments.</span>

                              <span>Deep learning often faces the challenge of efficiently processing dynamic
inputs, such as sensor data or user inputs. For example, an AI writing
assistant is required to update its suggestions in real time as a document is
edited. Re-running the model each time is expensive, even with compression
techniques like knowledge distillation, pruning, or quantization. Instead, we
take an incremental computing approach, looking to reuse calculations as the
inputs change. However, the dense connectivity of conventional architectures
poses a major obstacle to incremental computation, as even minor input changes
cascade through the network and restrict information reuse. To address this, we
use vector quantization to discretize intermediate values in the network, which
filters out noisy and unnecessary modifications to hidden neurons, facilitating
the reuse of their values. We apply this approach to the transformers
architecture, creating an efficient incremental inference algorithm with
complexity proportional to the fraction of the modified inputs. Our experiments
with adapting the OPT-125M pre-trained language model demonstrate comparable
accuracy on document classification while requiring 12.1X (median) fewer
operations for processing sequences of atomic edits.</span>

                              <span>I ask this simple question because while we are just now getting to the point that we can create a learning AI, how far are we going to let it go? The more advanced AI becomes the more risks it poses to humanity as a whole, including but not limited to:
  
Jobs
 How we interact with technology as a whole
 Cars
 Things we can not perceive in this lifetime yet may exist in the future.
  
Yes, AI is merely a tool... For now.
 But what happens when humanity creates an AI that can think for itself? How long is it going to take that AI to ask the question: &quot;Why am I listening to you?&quot; and as humans, our egotistical response will be: &quot;Because I created you.&quot;
 I feel that response will spell humanity&#x27;s doom, because if an AI can do something as complex as human-like thought and come to its own conclusions, what&#x27;s to stop it from believing it can feel emotion as well? MAYBE IT CAN and it was an unintended side effect or&quot;bug&quot; of creating an AI that can truly think for itself. Afterall, we as humans don&#x27;t even fully understand how human emotion works to begin with.
 The point I&#x27;m getting at is, that the farther we advance in AI, the more we risk dooming humanity to a (and I know this sounds silly but bare with me) a terminator-like future except this time we don&#x27;t have time travel to try and prevent &quot;judgement day&quot;.
 Or we could merely advance AI to this point and nothing horrible happens but I personally don&#x27;t like rolling those dice.
 Thoughts?

                              <span>LDM stands for Latent Diffusion Model. AudioLDM is a novel AI system that uses latent diffusion to generate high-quality speech, sound effects, and music from text prompts. It can either create sounds from just text or use text prompts to guide the manipulation of a supplied audio file. 
 I did a deep dive into how AudioLDM works with an eye towards possible startup applications. I think there are a couple of compelling products waiting to be built from this model, all around gaming and text-to-sound (not just text-to-speech... AudioLDM can also create very interesting and weird sound effects).
 From a technical standpoint and from reading the underlying paper, here are the key features I found to be noteworthy.
  
Uses a Latent Diffusion Model (LDM) to synthesize sound
 Trained in an unsupervised manner on large unlabeled audio datasets (closer to how humans learn about sound, that is, without a corresponding textual explanation)
 Operates in a continuous latent space rather than discrete tokens (smoother)
 Uses Cross-Modal Latent Alignment Pretraining (CLAP) to map text and audio. More details in article.
 Can generate speech, music, and sound effects from text prompts or a combination of a text and an audio prompt
 Allows control over attributes like speaker identity, accent, etc.
 Creates sounds not limited to human speech (e.g. nature sounds)
  
The link to the full write-up is here.
 Check out this video demo from the creator&#x27;s project website, showing off some of the unique generations the model can create. I liked the upbeat pop music the best, and I also thought the children singing, while creepy, was pretty interesting.

                              <span>What are currently the best ai voice generators for celebrities like Elon Musk Joe Biden Joe Rogan and so on.
 I&#x27;ve seen a few online sites that&#x27;s free but have many restriction insane waiting time and low quality output.
 The only paid alternativ I&#x27;ve seen recommend would be elevenlabs but your supposed to upload your own videos or voice recording there to &quot;create&quot; the voice yourself, idk how complicated that is and I was primarily looking for existing good quality paid or free voice generators for many different celebrities.

 stable diffusion often doesn&#x27;t seem to be able to interpret a lot of prompts very well or the results are more &quot;artistic&quot; and rather incoherent looking

                              <span>Hi All,
 I would really like to understand the logic behind these 1000 different LLMs that get launched every month. Ours has 75 Billion params, It can &quot;chat&quot;..pfft..I barely even get a chance to open another AI window than chat-gpt-4, Bing sucks with it&#x27;s 4000 token limit, Bard is useless. So these new chat AIs..for e.g this llama-2 what exactly is so special. What am I missing here?

                              <span>OpenAI, the company behind the popular ChatGPT, is coming with its own open-source large language model (LLM), codenamed G3PO, to compete with Microsoft x Meta’s Llama 2 AI.[1]
 Four generative AI pioneers(OpenAI, Microsoft, Google and Anthropic) launched the Frontier Model Forum, which will focus on ‘safe and responsible’ creation of new AI models.[2]
 As Open AI’s ChatGPT takes the tech world by storm, Chinese educational technology firm NetEase Youdao launched its large model, along with up to six applications, on Thursday, which marked the birth of one of China’s first large models in the education sector.[3]
 Chatbots such as Eva AI are getting better at mimicking human interaction but some fear they feed into unhealthy beliefs around gender-based control and violence. Replika, the most popular app of the kind, has its own subreddit where users talk about how much they love their “rep”, with some saying they had been converted after initially thinking they would never want to form a relationship with a bot.[4]

                              <span>I have a well performing model on azure AI currently and i am pulling it down locally so that I can use it. During pre-processing I am going about these steps. 
 - Re-Balance data (SMOTE, undersample)
 - Lag data 
 - Get all min max values into config
 - Scale Data with Min Max
 For context I will explain what step 3 (the config) is for, I take the the min and max values of the entire dataset (before split) for each feature. I then apply append these to my local version and being the scaling so then the local dataset is using the exact same scaling parameters as what is being using during the original pre-processing.
 I cannot show the full dataset due to privacy and the fact it has 3000+ features. But I will show 1 row with a couple of columns to compare AzureAI training data and my local pre-process that is using the exact same code / system.
 ​
 Azure AI dataset:
 Feature1 Feature2 Feature3
 0.637952 0.645434 0.641118
 ​
 Local dataset:
 Feature1 Feature2 Feature3
 0.461278 0.462896 0.472841 
 ​
 I have confirmed this is the exact same row of data because i have timestamped each row and matched them up to confirm that the dataset scaling is being simulated in my local version even though the code is carbon copy and the same min and max values are being used in the original dataset that used for training and testing. 
 Does anyone know a better way to scale data and ensure scaling stays consistent wherever the model is used? Or have maybe I missed something?

                              <span>I built out an automatic machine learning platform called Heimdall ML which helps anyone quickly deploy machine learning models to production.
 At a high level, my platform will:
  
Ingest your data as a .csv file
 Clean up any irregularities and prepare the data for modeling
 Build the most Optimal model for you use case
 Show you a results report to show both the performance and biases associated with your model
 Create an API endpoint to help you build new experiences with your model
  
The cool thing about my platform is that it allows you the ability to embed machine learning into your platform with ease. You have the ability to fully customize your experience to wow you customers. I built this entire platform by myself from scratch and am looking to grow the user base!
 The tool is completely FREE for hobby users! You can crunch some pretty large datasets (80 columns, 10K rows) with just the free version. If you have a use case that needs some big data processing, you will have to reach out to me directly so I can help set up a good plan for you. The reason for this is because the project is completely self funded and I want to be able to control the costs.
 I was inspired to create this platform while I was in grad school because many of the firms giving us talks would talk about how they had teams of engineers who build out pipelines to bring a model to production. I personally believe there can be an easier way.

I also want to understand theoretically, how more neurons capture non-linear relationships in data and what exactly is hierarchical representation of data and how hidden layers form and learn from these abstract representations of data. Apart from theory, I also want to learn the implementation of these models. I have some exposure to TF library, but I&#x27;m okay to learn Pytorch too, if needed.
 I need course or any sort of content recommendation on what are the best options to learn all this. So far, I&#x27;ve got recommendations for Deep Learning Specialization by Andrew Ng, but I would love to hear any alternate option or anything that I can do side by side this specialization.
 Thanks!

 I’m going to start my masters in machine learning soon, I have 1 month to go but I feel so underprepared to start this journey. To give you a bit of a background I’ve studied electrical engineering in my UG. I did very badly, I was very depressed and couldn’t study at all somehow I managed to scrape through the 4 years and now after working in software testing for 2 years I decided to take a leap in machine learning because it looked so interesting and I wanted a change. I’m scared now because my coding knowledge isn’t very good and idk how much of the math I know is useful for the degree I plan to do. Please help me I’m panicking. I know you would tell me it’s pretty irresponsible how I’ve handled my life till now but please overlook that and tell me what I can do better now..

                              <span>I have a data set that isn&#x27;t that large ~200 pdfs. I have done the regular RAG approach with Langchain, extracting text, splitting into chunks, embedding with OpenAi embeddings and FAISS vector storage. However, when I do a similarity search with a question I would like answered it returns the wrong context. The documents are semi-structured information of examined bridges. A question I would like answered is f.e. &#x27;what is the construction date of bridge X?&#x27;. When I input this question I get a lot of context of construction dates of other bridges. I think this is because the bridges are not explicitly mentioned in the text. I tried adding the bridge name and document name to the page content string of the chunks, but this does nothing.
 Does anyone have any tips on improving the embeddings retrieval in this case?

                              <span>Hey guys, we have an internal tool that preps our models for inference by compiling it to Onnx/TensorRT and quantizing it to I8/FP16. It also benchmarks them for accuracy loss and latency. It&#x27;s kinda like github actions for your model. We are considering releasing it as it&#x27;s standalone product, would anyone be interested?

                              <span>Hi,
 I am trying domain adaptation on my company’s data. The data is a set of documentations that we have for a product.
 We want to take Llama2 and feed all this data to it.
 I have fine-tuned Llama2 using PEFT on a CLM task, where the data will be like [Title:\nContent:].
 When I now try to prompt the model I have to provide the prompt in a similar format, but I want the model to understand that I want to perform QA task on the data, as well as any other knowledge the model previously had.
 What am I missing here or what am I doing wrong? How can I set up this task better? Any pointers will help.
 Thanks!

                              <span>I recently found out about starcoder and have been trying to play with it and figure it out in a colab notebook. Unfortunately, it’s much more difficult to download than normal models on hugging face and I’m running into a Key Value error when I call the model. I don’t want to spam with with code or pictures, but has anyone worked with StarCoder on hugging face and been able to be successful?

 So I am training my baseline model using A2C on simple spread environment and no matter how I am changing and testing different parameters, when evaluating the total reward is highly negative.
 Any help on that would be appreciated.

                              <span>For quite some time now I have been looking to recreate the results of the following paper on the Atari-100k benchmark. The paper poses two slightly different algorithms, one for SAC and one for DQN, however my work only focuses on the DQN version.
 IMAGE AUGMENTATION IS ALL YOU NEED: REGULARIZING DEEP REINFORCEMENT LEARNING FROM PIXELS 
 https://openreview.net/pdf?id&#x3D;GY6-6sTvGaf
 Despite this, my results have come up significantly short of the results claimed by the paper, so am looking for anyone to have a look and see anything I may have done wrong. All the code is on the following Github:
 https://github.com/VIPTankz/DeepLearningDrQ/tree/main
 There should also be everything you need to run the code if you wish to do so.
 The authors claim a human-normalised benchmark of 0.270, however my code only achieves 0.108. 
 Any help would be much appreciated! 
 Also worth noting: for evaluation, the authors use 125k steps, however I&#x27;m using the more recent standard of doing 100 episodes, irrespective of length. I highly doubt however that this causes the change in results.

                              <span>How does frame-skipping result in better performance, versus taking an inference every frame for RL algorithms? Wouldn&#x27;t taking an inference every second speed up training, as you would have more steps to train on in the same amount of time? The only downside I could think to no frame-skip is that steps become closer to each other, but I don&#x27;t understand if that leads to any bad performance, and if it does, why.
 For context I have an environment where frames are relatively slow to generate (im only getting 1000 frames per minute from each env, and I can only run 6 instances on my pc at the same time). While off policy algorithms like SAC would probably be better suited to the task, I&#x27;ve been having really great success with PPO, and am reluctant to spend more time learning and fine-tuning SAC, as I&#x27;ve heard it can take as long as DDPG to converge.

                              <span>The consensus is that fine tuning LLMs works reasonably for smaller scale instruction tuning, where you pass in ~1k-10k input/output examples to modify the model output.
 There seems to be a lot of contradictory info regarding fine tuning for domain knowledge, where you pass in large amounts of unsupervised, domain scale data.
 Per OpenAI:
  
People that can’t get finetuning to work are often asking for orange juice from a cow. 
 LLMs are pretrained (hence the name: Generative Pretrained Transformer) They already have all the knowledge you will need (with some exceptions). You cannot teach it anything new, you can only teach it a specific pattern. 
 People have not defined their goal clearly enough for a human to do the task. LLMs are not magic, if a human cannot understand the task, the L…</span>

                              <span>I’m a PhD student and a problem I’ve been working on has connections to dictionary learning. I’d like to pursue this connection, but neither myself or my advisor have much knowledge of the dictionary learning or the surrounding literature. 
 Questions:
  
Is dictionary learning an active area of interest for modern ML? I understand that it might be more niche than some of the topics getting headlines these days, but I’d be curious to hear about applications where dictionary learning is used/reasonably competitive.
 
Are there any references in dictionary learning that you’d consider to be “essential” reading?
 
 Thanks!

                              <span>Hello Reddit,
 I&#x27;m currently at a crossroads in my academic journey and I could use some insights from those more experienced in the field of machine learning and AI.
 I&#x27;m choosing between two programs: Applied Data Science and AI and Data Science and AI. Each program has its own unique structure and focus which I will briefly summarize below.
 Applied Data Science and AI is a two-year program with a focus on practicality and project-based learning. It includes the following core courses:
  
Introduction to Data Science
 Python for Data Scientists
 Applied Mathematical Thinking
 Statistical Methods for Data Science
 Applied Machine Learning
 Computational Techniques for Large-Scale Data
 Research Methods for Data Science
 Master’s Thesis in Data Science
  
The program also offers the flexibility to choose optional courses to tailor my learning towards my own interests.
 On the other hand, Data Science and AI takes a more rigorous, math-intensive approach in its first year with compulsory courses such as:
  
Introduction to data science and artificial intelligence
 Nonlinear optimization
 Stochastic processes and Bayesian statistics
 Design of AI systems
  
The second year involves a Master&#x27;s thesis and elective courses from a diverse range of topics.
 Given that my ultimate goal is to become a proficient machine learning developer, I&#x27;m leaning towards the Applied Data Science and AI program for its hands-on approach. However, I&#x27;m aware that the Data Science and AI program&#x27;s heavy math focus in the first year could provide a robust theoretical foundation that could be beneficial.
 I&#x27;d love to hear from anyone who has been through similar programs or who works in the field. Which of these two programs do you think would best prepare me for a career in machine learning? How important is a deep mathematical foundation versus a more applied, project-based learning approach? 
 Thank you in advance!

                              <span>We&#x27;re looking for some beta testers and input on our newest project called Cloaked AI that allows you to protect sensitive data that gets stored as vector embeddings (and metadata) in a vector database. You can join the beta tester waitlist here (we&#x27;ll be rolling out access in the next few weeks). But here are some FAQs about why protecting vector embeddings matters, etc.
 Why should I be worried about sensitive data in vector embeddings?
 To a human, vectors are meaningless. But to the AI, the vectors contain all of the meaning found in the original sensitive data. Generative AI systems can recreate the original sensitive data to a high degree of accuracy (though in their own style). That means the data stored in vector databases are a significant security and privacy risk for companies t…</span>

                              <span>I&#x27;m still learning the basic concepts here, as I explore the creative potential of LLMs — one potential problem I&#x27;ve been thinking about is how these models come to understand good or bad answers. 
 I know that once they reach the public, the feedback loop is fairly binary -- Yes, this was a good result, or No, this was a poor result. 
 It seems like a lot of the subjective detail might be lost (e.g. Why was it a bad result?) and I was wondering if this detail is captured elsewhere in the training process. 
 There is so much subjectivity involved in creative works, I wonder if this is why we tend to see the output of LLMs as being creatively bland and/or uninspired (that is— by default, without extensive prompting)

                              <span>I&#x27;m looking at building a computer for AI/ML and gaming, and I&#x27;m trying to decide between windows and linux as the operating system. I&#x27;m very comfortable with linux. I&#x27;ve heard that WSL basically allows you to run a virtualized linux install on top of windows, so I was wondering, is this how most AI/ML is done on windows? Are there things that you can do more easily on linux itself than via WSL? Anything else I should know about AI/ML and WSL?

 I&#x27;m looking for any idea/paper for my master thesis, which I&#x27;d like to work on lip reading from video.
 Opening Google Scholar gives a very vast ideas that one can easily get lost. If it&#x27;s an interesting paper, I get afraid that it would be too heavy for such a project.
 Therefore I&#x27;d like to ask for your opinion/suggestion!
 Your reply/thoughts would be so much appreciated.

I should have had my thesis done a year ago from this point but I pretty much lost all my motivation for this field when I started working and discovered what it means to work. I live in south Spain, which honestly can barely pass as first world and thus, my wage, while being &quot;ok&quot; for my age and the place I work in is just pathetic by every other metric.

 After almost 1.5 years since our latest contribution to tabular DL architectures, we are ready to announce TabR - our new retrieval-based tabular DL model. In a nutshell, TabR is a simple feed-forward network with k-Nearest-Neighbors-On-Steroids (formally, a generalized attention mechanism) in the middle.

 The figure below shows just a small part of the results, but it gives an idea of why we are excited about this new release. I hope you will enjoy reading the paper, and I will be glad to answer the questions!

                              <span>Hi, am I looking for someone to point me in the right direction.
 The task is, to classify the HTTP requests that come to honeypot as &quot;crawler&quot; or &quot;malicious&quot;. For example, if I can detect a Log4j exploit inside on of the headers I can say that that request is malicious. 
 The problem is, this exploit could be inside any numerous headers. It can be at the beginning or at the end. And this is just 1 exploit. There are many different exploits with their own unique strings. And I don&#x27;t know them all, nor do I have a &quot;regex&quot; for each 1 of them. The malicious string could also not be inside headers, but inside URL, as query parameter. Or if the request was made to something like www/IP.com/phpadmin/.env (or something like this).
 My current thought process is, to take some open-source LLN, because it has some basic knowledge of how language works and somehow add this cybersecurity domain knowledge to it. To further train it on CVE database, example scripts that showcase each CVE, etc. 
 ​
 Am I barking at the right tree here? Or should I maybe train a language model from scratch, so that the embeddings, etc are specialized to cybersec space (because there is a lot of programming code here). Or maybe I should use some other ways to analyse text?
 ​
 I would be greatefull if someone can point me in the right direction (links to blogs, or articles, or some other education material).
 ​
 Thanks

                              <span>My research involves orbital communication and Orbital Edge Computing. I&#x27;m trying to determine if upload bandwidth limitations would present a problem in many cases for ML models. I can find info on the very large and very small models, but I&#x27;m trying to get a vague sense for median size in MB. 
 I know that everyone is going to start jumping in with &#x27;well it depends&#x27; and I know that&#x27;s the case, but I&#x27;m just trying to get a rough order of magnitude. Computer vision/earth obs is the ideal but anything is useful. Also happy to answer questions about my research if anyone is interested. Thanks!

                              <span>Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance on various quantitative reasoning and knowledge benchmarks. However, many of these benchmarks are losing utility as LLMs get increasingly high scores, despite not yet reaching expert performance in these domains. We introduce ARB, a novel benchmark composed of advanced reasoning problems in multiple fields. ARB presents a more challenging test than prior benchmarks, featuring problems in mathematics, physics, biology, chemistry, and law. As a subset of ARB, we introduce a challenging set of math and physics problems which require advanced symbolic reasoning and domain knowledge. We evaluate recent models such as GPT-4 and Claude on ARB and demonstrate that current models score well below 50% on more demanding tasks. In order to improve both automatic and assisted evaluation capabilities, we introduce a rubric-based evaluation approach, allowing GPT-4 to score its own intermediate reasoning steps. Further, we conduct a human evaluation of the symbolic subset of ARB, finding promising agreement between annotators and GPT-4 rubric evaluation scores.

                              <span>I&#x27;m an academic doing PhD research on Virtual Worlds, and have found 100 amazing texts.
 I found some of these titles based on conversations with Chat GPT4, and am so impressed with the AI stuff (although I&#x27;m so new). 
 My Goal: To build a database of the top 1000 books / papers I find over the next few years, and have some AI model help me see connections between them. 
 My Challenge: ChatGPT won&#x27;t allow me to input whole PDFs / eBooks, so I&#x27;m looking for some other solution. I&#x27;ve heard about LAMA models from Meta but I don&#x27;t know much about this. I do have a decent PC with a 1080ti GPU and 32g of ram. 
 Can anyone point me in the right direction of projects dealing with AI databases to input one&#x27;s literature collection?

                              <span>As I was going through a lot of articles about the AI investments , I found out that stability AI&#x27;s founder Emad Mostaque in the Bloomberg tech summit quoted that &quot;AI will be the biggest bubble of all the time and I&#x27;d prefer to call it the dot AI bubble &quot; , He also added an example where Google lost a 100 billion dollar worth shares after their AI event where Bard AI gave out incorrect response. It&#x27;s still in its early stage and buisness which doesn&#x27;t use AI will be punished by the stock market. Here&#x27;s some more predictions from VCs like Ken smythe, Next Round Capital Partners mainly invests in technology and AI startups.

 I know how to judge the second type as they basically can do everything the first one can but have a pretty GUI to boot. But what about the third ones? How likely is it for a (www.yet-another-ai-startup.ai) sort of company to develop a model that outperforms GPT on a domain specific task?

                              <span>Hello all, 
 I&#x27;ve been reading on some posts and have taken note of various courses, including a free Harvard one. 
 I&#x27;m 35 and am a manager for a finance company.
 What courses would you recommend for managers, executives, directors that will not restart their careers and do the actual technical side of things but instead want to learn how to implement AI in future products/services/projects?
 Thank you all in advance

                              <span>Hey everyone, 
 I am an undergrad student with some modest knowledge of reinforcement learning techniques. I would like to start working on a project, but I really don&#x27;t want it to be something obvious like the snake game (which btw I have already done) or something similar. I would like to spend some time on this project, and eventually build my undegrad thesis on top of it. It does not necessarily have to be something with a very practical application, some research would be fine too (keeping in mind that I am undegrad ofc).
 Do you have any ideas that you could share with me? I would be very grateful!

                              <span>Hi all! I am wondering if anyone has any experience with multi-dimensional vector clusters? I have a large database of 4096 dimensional vector embeddings which I want to identify clusters in. Essentially I’ve created vector embeddings for a bunch of descriptions using a LLM embedding end point and am storing them in Weviate. Now I need to try and find clusters of similar vectors within a predefined threshold of cosine similarity (or whatever nearest neighbor approach works for this). I don’t want to do a pure random center approach and would rather have a heat map approach where I’m targeting high concentrations of similar vectors… any ideas on how to approach this or thoughts on where I can do more research? I’m at my wits end on this one!

                              <span>Most in-browser dataset browsers (e.g. Huggingface, Kaggle) make it hard to star interesting examples, add notes, render complex data types, or drill down on model mispredictions. I&#x27;ve built a number of one-off visualization tools over the years but there&#x27;s a lot of boilerplate involved that tends to get repeated between these tools.
 We&#x27;ve been working on a dataset + model browser that avoids all the boilerplate and helps ML teams focus on their data instead of tooling. It&#x27;s meant to be interactive, configurable and collaborative. 
 Here&#x27;s a quick demo showing our current flow: https://youtu.be/utkSCU2ktck 
 Would anyone be willing to help beta test or provide suggestions for must-have features for a collaborative dataset browser?

                              <span>Hey, I&#x27;m a phd student in compiler optimisations and I might be picking up a project a masters student kicked off. CPUs do a lot of predictions about how code is going to behave as it&#x27;s executing it, and a major one is branch prediction - whether an if statement is going to be true or false. This masters student recorded the results of every if statement each time they were executed across a large program (this results in millions+ of data points). They then tested the branch prediction accuracy of a transformer model by stepping through this trace of if statement values and having the transformer predict the next one based off only the prior values. They found it actually does a pretty good job! Most of the time the CPU can do this better, but there are cases where it wins out that we&#x27;re …</span>

                              <span>📢💡 Ever wondered how we can make our deep generative models respect causal structure? This is key to creating authentic &quot;what if&quot; scenarios in our images!
 In our latest research, we deal with high-fidelity image counterfactuals, the generation of images based on &quot;what if&quot; scenarios that align with a specified causal graph. 🖼️🔄
 Why is this important? Causality gives us the tools to carry out principled counterfactual inference, which - among other things - is useful for maintaining subject identity in image counterfactuals. 🧩🔍
 Principled counterfactuals of structured variables like images have great potential for:
 (i) Generating causal explanations 🔮
 (ii) Providing targeted data augmentation 🎯
 (iii) Evaluating fairness &amp; robustness 🛡️
 (iv) Protecting your privacy 🕵️‍♀️
 and more...

 I know some other well known languages might work, but I need a model that is specifically made for multilingual usage.
 Or should I just train a model for my specific language from scratch?

 We&#x27;re updating our awesome-python-for-data-science repository.
 Some things we&#x27;re hoping to add:
  
Best books and repositories to find resources
 Best open source tools (teaching tools, preferrably free)
 
Best interactive resources --&gt; especially this one, what are you using nowadays? 
  
I&#x27;ve heard about Virgilio but feels like TL, DR, we&#x27;re looking for practice-learning!

 I&#x27;m trying to get into AI in the scope of training it to play some simple gym games from OpenAi and I&#x27;ve been particularly drawn to Deep Q learning as a starting point (did some basic Q tables ). While trying to inquire into the knowledge of the web I keep finding examples of code that seem simple enough to understand however, whenever I try to use the code it doesn&#x27;t work. I want to learn to use TensorFlow with Keras but it seems like the syntax regularly gets updated.
 My questions to you all are :
 - Would you recommend Tensorflow/Keras as entry point to AI and NN?
 - Which libraries do you use and which version of those libraries?
 - Furthermore, I keep seeing people use Ubuntu in VB. Is this best practice or can we use Windows 10 in 2023?

                              <span>Hi folks, 
 I&#x27;ve been recently diving into the intersection of time series forecasting and changepoint detection (CPD) methodologies. I understand the utility of CPD in improving forecasts by identifying structural breaks in time series data, but I&#x27;ve noticed a lack of emphasis in the literature on the reverse - using forecasting models to inform CPD.
 One might think a straightforward approach could be using an ARIMA model (or any other forecasting model) and leveraging the forecast error by comparing it to the real values. In theory, if the forecast error crosses a certain threshold, it might indicate a changepoint.
 However, I also understand the complications this approach might bring:
  
Stationarity Assumptions: ARIMA and similar models are built on the assumption that the data are stationary. A sudden changepoint could violate this assumption, leading to model misspecification and thus larger errors.
 Defining Large Errors: Establishing a fixed threshold to define a &#x27;large&#x27; error might be problematic in practice due to time-varying variance and other dynamics.
 Error Dependencies: Forecast errors are typically not independent but form an error process. A large error might be part of a larger trend or cycle, and thus might not necessarily indicate a changepoint.
  
So while these obstacles seem substantial, I&#x27;m curious if anyone has any experience or knowledge in effectively employing forecasting models for CPD, or if there are research efforts or methodologies I may not be aware of. Looking forward to hearing your thoughts and engaging in some fruitful discussions!

 I’m using few shot learning process and providing the model with examples to learn from. The model performs fairly okay but it needs to be better.
 Is it always a good thing to add a lot of examples like 100 string/dict pair examples for the model to learn from or is this one of those things in stats/machine learning that the obvious isn’t always the best choice lol?
 I’d appreciate any advice please.

                              <span>Hi, i wanted to modify this Speaker recognition (not speech recognition) example by keras by recognizing when an unknown speaker is speaking.
 So the network needs to be able to tell which of the speakers is talking, and if none of them is talking, it needs to say that none of them is talking.
 I don&#x27;t mean if there is silence, because then it would be enough to train the network to recognize silence, I mean just if a speaker who is not in the set is speaking.
 For what i think I can extend this problem to it will be like to recognize if an image is not part of the mnist dataset.

                              <span>Hello!
 I&#x27;m curious to know how you guys currently track changes and general information for your ML/DL models. 
 By changes, I&#x27;m referring to parameters, accuracy/loss, functions your model uses, training data etc across different versions of your models.
 By general changes, I&#x27;m referring to descriptions of what the model does, code changes, tags and so on.
 I&#x27;m under the impression most people are using MLFlow, W&amp;Bs etc which I guess is fine but I&#x27;m finding that these tools treat models as static files, as second-class citizens which is annoying when I want to zero in on a model and understand what and how something was changed away from an experiment. This gets really annoying when I&#x27;m looking at model version 134 created by Mike in the other team.
 Curious to know how people are tracking models and what they think generally about model tracking. Thanks!

                              <span>Been involved in a research project of a session based recommendation systems , where we have a historical purchases of users and the goal is to predict the next going to be purchased item. Given this and assuming that we have somehow represented each item in a session as an embedding and these embeddings acts as an input to the transformer model and the output is an embedding of the next product. In the train set, there are some millions sessions which has both previous purchases products of arbitrary length and next item. So the transformer is trained with supervised loss of predicted and actual next item embedding, the problem i have been facing is that the loss is saturating and there is not much learning over time. Any suggestions on how to improve this. Tried increasing the number of layers and did some hyper tuning corresponding to learning rate and weight decay but similar behaviour is observed.

                              <span>Hey, as we all know about the AI songs released recently, which are basically vocal deepfakes.
 However I&#x27;d like to know the tools used, if anyone knows?
 I&#x27;d like to feed it my own voice, even if it&#x27;s a paid service. I&#x27;m interested in playing around with it.
 I&#x27;ve tried googling but there&#x27;s too much info and each contradicts the other lol.
 Any info is appreciated. :)

                              <span>I really like the spongebob AI stuff using RVC-2 but I&#x27;ve only used it for the funny voice models, I haven&#x27;t tried making my own. I want to experiment with this, but haven&#x27;t look into it yet because I&#x27;m wondering if there is something better out there for what I&#x27;m trying to do? 
 I like the RVC one because I can sing my parts and swap it to be any other voice, which is what I&#x27;d like to do (no text to voice stuff). 
 Also I know the training data for a lot of the voice models for this come from the TV show and other clear recordings which are compressed and equalized properly. However I&#x27;d like to train the AI using raw, uncompressed wav files that generally have a lot of headroom and dynamic range (but does vary a lot). Its ok if the output sounds similar as a result because I want to apply compression and eq AFTER the fact anyway. But if this would affect training it then I&#x27;d be willing scrape through all these voice recordings and process them for loudness and clarity beforehand so the model does better.
 ​
 Anyway, any guidance would be greatly appreciated because I&#x27;m new to AI. I have basic dev experience (no AI stuff) and I&#x27;m mostly skilled in music production, but I would love to try to have a tool like this in my arsenal. If there&#x27;s anywhere else I can post about this I&#x27;d like to know too. Thanks!

                              <span>We’re getting closer and closer to more believable and realistic AI interpersonal interaction. We already have Character.AI and other platforms for creating and interacting with personalized AIs. Some will use/view them as emotional partners, and one day the hardware will be good enough that we can begin making believable bodies for them.
 One of the complaints I’ve seen from ordinary people about “waifus” is that they are often times created in a way that ordinary people would not find natural in a “real” human being. Examples being people who have trouble dating “real” people could just buy an AI girlfriend or boyfriend who is considered “beautiful” or “handsome” that is designed to be subservient to their owner in ways that ordinary people feel a “real” person would not otherwise wish to be. The idea being that &quot;weeaboo neckbeards will buy a Japanese AI girlfriend who looks 14 and she will be coded to worship the ground he walks on despite that he&#x27;s an unwashed incel&quot;.
 What do you think society&#x27;s/the government&#x27;s views and roles will mean for these AI companions? Do you think anyone will be able to force &quot;AI morality&quot;, like an angry feminist being mad that an &quot;incel&quot; has created a female being who shows no desire for feminist ideals and is &quot;happy&quot; to be at her owner&#x27;s beck and call in whatever way he wants?
 I guess this is sort of related to MGTOW, or Men Going Their Own Way, being able to create the partners they want, in whatever way they want.
 Do you feel that &quot;once I own it, I can do whatever I want with it&quot; should apply in its entirety? What about people &quot;hacking&quot; their AI to remove any supposed &quot;morality programming&quot; so they can make their AI waifu act however they want?
 We&#x27;ve seen with movies like Bicentennial Man, where people push to give these kinds of AIs &#x27;personhood&#x27; and the same rights as human citizens.
 How do others feel about this issue?

                              <span>Ridgelinez (Tokyo) is a subsidiary of Fujitsu in Japan that announced the development of a generative artificial intelligence (AI) system capable of engaging in voice communication with humans. The applications of this system include assisting companies in conducting meetings or providing career planning advice to employees.[1] 
 BMW has revealed that artificial intelligence is already allowing it to cut costs at its sprawling factory in Spartanburg, South Carolina. The AI system has allowed BMW to remove six workers from the line and deploy them to other jobs. The tool is already saving the company over $1 million a year.[2]
 MIT’s ‘PhotoGuard‘ protects your images from malicious AI edits. The technique introduces nearly invisible “perturbations” to throw off algorithmic models.[3]
 Microsoft with its TypeChat library seeks to enable easy development of natural language interfaces for large language models (LLMs) using types. Introduced July 20 of a team with c# and TypeScript lead developer Anders Hejlsberg, a Microsoft Technical Fellow, TypeChat addresses the difficulty of developing natural language interfaces where apps rely on complex decision trees to determine intent and gather necessary input to act.[4]

 I really need your help guys.
 ​
 Is the code (uploaded on https://pastebin.com/LgB3hM47#google_vignette) for 2-heads DQN&#x27;s training correct .
 Moreover, how can I modify the code below to be suitable for a 2-heads DQN with a prioritized buffer replay such that action is a 2-element list (Please see the image below).

                              <span>I am looking at the docs for DQN in SB3. I see the following hyper-parameters for controlling exploration - &#x60; exploration_fraction &#x60;, &#x60; exploration_initial_eps &#x60; and &#x60; exploration_final_eps &#x60;. But I don&#x27;t think I can control the decaying of epsilon with them. Could someone please help with this issue?

                              <span>Hey all! I&#x27;m excited to share SimplePyDash, a new tool I&#x27;ve developed for real-time data visualization. It&#x27;s a versatile, browser-based dashboard designed to make data plotting as straightforward as possible!
 I thought about posting this here because it started as a project to monitor agents&#x27; behaviour in an OpenAI Gym environment. But it can be used for all sorts of things!
 Whether you&#x27;re monitoring an OpenAI Gym environment, plotting your latest ML model&#x27;s performance, or just need a flexible way to stream data, SimplePyDash has got you covered. With a clean, column-based layout and a set of intuitive default widgets, you can create your own custom dashboard in no time.
 Installing is as easy as running pip install simple-pydash, and there are several example scripts in the repo to help get you started.
 Check out the GitHub Repository for more details. If you like it, leave a start and feel free to share your feedback or questions. Thanks for checking it out!

Deep learning has recently made tremendous progress in a wide range of problems and applications, but models often fail unpredictably when deployed in unseen domains or distributions. Source-free domain adaptation (SFDA) is an area of research that aims to design methods for adapting a pre-trained model (trained on a “source domain”) to a new “target domain”, using only unlabeled data from the latter. 
 

Designing adaptation methods for deep models is an important area of research. While the increasing scale of models and training datasets has been a key ingredient to their success, a negative consequence of this trend is that training such models is increasingly computationally expe…</span>

                              <span>I found it a bit hard to follow OpenAI&#x27;s public releases - sometimes they just announce a model is coming without giving a date, sometimes they announce model deprecations and it&#x27;s hard to understand whether we should use those models in production or not. 
 I am a visual thinker so putting everything in a single image made sense to me. Check it out below, and if you have any questions or suggestions, please let me know!

                              <span>In a study published earlier this month, scientists at Rice and Stanford University concluded that training AI models exclusively on the outputs of generative AI is not a good idea. They titled their report: “Self-consuming generative models go MAD(Model Autophagy Disorder)”.[1]
 To enhance SQL query building, Lasse, a seasoned full-stack developer, has recently released AIHelperBot. This powerful tool enables individuals and businesses to write SQL queries efficiently, enhance productivity, and learn new SQL techniques.[2] 
 Japan’s Ministry of Economy, Trade, and Industry (METI) has announced its plans to develop a new supercomputer to help advance the country’s artificial intelligence (AI) industry. The new supercomputer (SC) will be operated by the National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology (AIST).[3]
 Google co-founder Sergey Brin is back in the company’s office working directly with members of the artificial intelligence team.[4]

                              <span>Hi all!
 I&#x27;d would like to share a simple, straight-forward Web Content Embedding Transformer lambda function to create and store embeddings of web content. This is a Lambda function that scrapes for URLs, then uses URLs those to scrape for page content, which it splits into chunks then transforms to embedding using OpenAI. It then stores the embeddings to your Pinecone DB including metadata. You can then use the embedding for custom chatbots etc.
 Heres a link to a public REPO.

 Do I need to scale in the first place? 
 Also please answer this general question: How to get a Deep learning model to work well on Regression tasks?

 So I was wondering if there’s a platform that hosts models for free for hobbists? 
 The idea is to build a simple portfolio project just to display to recruiters.

                              <span>Hello world 👋
 We&#x27;re developing an open-source &amp; collaborative testing framework for ML models, from tabular to LLMs: https://github.com/Giskard-AI/giskard
 Testing Machine Learning applications can be tedious. Since ML models depend on data, testing scenarios depend on the domain specificities and are often infinite.
 Where to start testing? Which tests to implement? What issues to cover? How to implement the tests?
 At Giskard, we believe that Machine Learning needs its own testing framework. Created by ML engineers for ML engineers, Giskard contains 2 components:
  
The Giskard Python library helps data scientists detect hidden vulnerabilities in ML models. 
 It makes the AI development process more efficient, by automating the identification of risks of biases, performance issues and errors.
 To try it, see this documentation: https://docs.giskard.ai/en/latest/guides/scan/index.html
 
 The Giskard server helps ML engineers debug &amp; monitor models, share dashboards, and collaborate. 
 It makes the deployment of new ML models safer and more efficient, by providing ready-made monitoring dashboards, catalogs of re-usable testing components, and ML debugging interfaces.
 To try it, see this documentation: https://docs.giskard.ai/en/latest/guides/installation_app/index.html
 
  
We released our v2 in Beta last month, and we&#x27;re very interested in your feedback as QA engineers!

                              <span>Hello everyone, I have this problem where I have a 1D sequence of numbers of length 3 like this: 
 [1,50,500], with 35 distinct combinations.
 I need to map it to 2D sequence of number of 1024 length. Like this : 
 [ [ 23.78, 234, 13,…n], [ 234,76.9, 763,…n ]] , where n &#x3D;1024.
 Is it possible in ML to do so?
 The 2D sequence can paired ( can be represented an image). 
 Thank you very much !

I am curious to know about the datasets you folks are looking for, to the extent that you would even consider paying for them or sacrifice your newborn baby. By extension, tell us about the project(s) you&#x27;ve been working on and how the data would help!

                              <span>One of my acquaintances is an artist and is asking my assistance in utilizing Machine Learning and AI to sort his entire iCloud library of 57,000 images into 300+ categories. Some of these categories include things that the media is made of such as ceramics wood, or the artist that created this work while other categories include whether the photo contains an animal or a person. 
 I am wondering if there are specific ML programs that would be a good fit for his situation. My idea suggested to use Apple’s CoreML which I have experience in. I could develop him an app that he could then create train and swap image recognition models using the GUI CreateML tool using the images he has already sorted. Do you think this is the best approach or is there another tool out there that could do this task for him easily?

 To align advanced AIs, an ensemble of diverse, transparent Overseer AIs will independently monitor the target AI and provide granular assessments on its alignment with constitution, human values, ethics, and safety. Overseer interventions will be incremental and subject to human oversight. The system will be implemented cautiously, with extensive testing to validate capabilities. Alignment will be treated as an ongoing collaborative process between humans, Overseers, and the target AI, leveraging complementary strengths through open dialog. Continuous vigilance, updating of definitions, and contingency planning will be required to address inevitable uncertainties and risks.

                              <span>I just watched a video that explains how LoRA works. As I understand it&#x27;s a fast and efficient way to fine tune models.
 At the end of the video he he said you could easily swap out the fine-tuned LoRA. So it makes LLMs like a PC. You just install new software / add the finetuned lora weights and you&#x27;re good to go. Is my understanding correct?
 The rumor is that GPT-4 is a 8 way mixture model. Could they have pretrained it with all the data and then just use LoRA to train the expert models? I guess they would also need to train a smaller model that decides which model to use. I can&#x27;t imagine that they would train GPT-4 eight times / once for each expert models.

For us, this benchmark is a new one, so it was really interesting to check whether our previous findings generalize to new unseen datasets (spoiler: they do):

 Also more importantly how do you all feeling about synthetic data, I started this as a fun project and its turning into a full blown startup. I love seeing some of the users send me results they are getting like this.

 What voice cloning options are people using right now? Looking at what is out there (that I know of), there is ElevenLabs and Coqui. Are there any other ones that are good? Preferably cheap/run locally?

 I could extract the audio and use an audio annotation tool, but since some of the sound events may sound similar to one another, it would be helpful to look at both the image and the audio waveform to identify which class a sound event belongs to. Thanks!

I have been thinking about this for years as I hate the cumbersome process of switching jobs.
 I have been planing it under the last year and finally I quit my job and built this in the last 1.5 months.
 I am lunching my Data Professionals job platform &quot;applyscript dot com&quot;
 I would like to receive some feedback from you guys.
 I really want to hear your opinion as that can help me improve the site a lot.
  
Thx for stopping by and giving feedback, I really appreciate your time and effort. :)

                              <span>I&#x27;m looking to implement Fictitious Self-Play in a model-based game (imperfect information limited to simultaneous move game, however each player has a combinatorial number of actions they can perform). EDIT: I know self-fictitious play is not the only option to solve this type of game, but I wanted to give it a try to test how it would behave (especially since I sort of like the idea behind it).
 Because of this combinatorial number of actions, solving it with linear programming is just not possible (I&#x27;d have to compute for each sequence of pair of actions (a1, b1), (a2, b2), (a3, b3), ... (ak, bk), whether player a or player b won).
 But to compute a best response I might be able to use Q-learning in a RL setting right (by that I mean, fixed environment)? Because when we calculate a best…</span>

 I have a pybullet simulation of a bipedal robot wrapped as a gym env. Currently trying to train a Rl ppo algo to control it to walk. But no luck. Having the issue that it&#x27;s trying everything except walking. And it seems to prioritise getting the instant reward by kicking its leg forward then lunging forward and the episode ends. Instead of walking forward and getting more score. Anyone have any tips please? (Btw gamma &#x3D; 0.99)
 ​
 Btw if anyone has experience with stuff like this I am looking to hire an engineer. Comment or dm me
 ​
 Btw I am aware this is a significant undertaking

 Geoffrey Everest Hinton (born 6 December 1947) is a British-Canadian cognitive psychologist and computer scientist, most noted for his work on artificial neural networks. From 2013 to 2023, he divided his time working for Google (Google Brain) and the University of Toronto, before publicly announcing his departure from Google in May 2023 citing concerns about the risks of artificial intelligence (AI) technology. In 2017, he co-founded and became the chief scientific advisor of the Vector Institute in Toronto.
 Gary Fred Marcus (born 8 February 1970) is an American psychologist, cognitive scientist, and author, known for his research on the intersection of cognitive psychology, neuroscience, and artificial intelligence (AI).

                              <span>This is the content of my Friday newsletter Five Things AI. Every week I publish links to five articles about the current developments in AI, not so much with a focus on the tech aspects of AI, but more with an interest in finding out how AI changes our work, our economy and how we live in our societies. 
 ‘WarGames’ anticipated our current AI fears 40 years ago this summer
 WarGames cannot be 40 years old, but I still remember watching it in a movie theater as a kid… what a great movie, it genuienely sparked my interests in computers. The evil side of AI is still very dominant in the discussions of AI, so WarGames really was an early example of our fear of the machines taking over.

 ChatGPT: The ontology proposed in the aforementioned description appears to rely heavily on emergent properties, consciousness, and free will, with a substantial focus on the temporal aspect. The challenge is to see how these metaphysical elements, particularly when applied to an AI, can help in reconciling the often contrasting principles of relativity and quantum physics.
 At first glance, the connection may not be clear; relativity and quantum mechanics operate in different realms of the physical universe. However, upon closer examination, one might see potential pathways to harmonize these distinct theories via the ontology of consciousness and emergent free will. …</span>

                              <span>People in intellectual jobs have often been thought of as doing something inherently more complex than manual workers in, for instance, construction or farming.
 Whether or not that is true, the surprise twist is that their “complex” work will be the first to be replaced. Computers have cracked intellectual work sooner than they have cracked manual work. It’s still too complex for a robot to replace a fruit-picker completely, but we’ll soon see AI lawyers.
 So we’re going to see a mass inversion. Everyone today sitting prettily doing their intellectual jobs will find their wages crushed or jobs redundant as AI replaces them. Meanwhile, everyone doing the jobs robotics can’t yet replace will be best placed to continue doing them.
 High flying executives will find they are suitable only for shelf-stacking, while those who’ve worked in retail for years will be or become their bosses.
 Soon enough, AI will help us advance the field of robotics sufficiently for manual labour also to be replaced. Who knows what happens then.

 FreeWilly1 and its successor FreeWilly2 are powerful new open-source Large Language Models (LLMs) developed by Stability AI’s CarperAI team. Both models perform exceptionally well in reasoning competitions using many different metrics.[2]
 Japanese education services company Benesse will offer a new service to help elementary school students with their research projects using generative artificial intelligence during the summer break.[3]
 The MTA is using artificial intelligence to help monitor fare evasion in several subway stations across New York City.[4]

We have already begun the process of digitizing all the documents into OCR&#x27;ed PDF files, so this part at least is covered. 
 My question is, what are the hot fully offline AI models I could try in an airgapped environment that will allow us to import all of the PDF files and their metadata (title/date/tags/etc), to incorporate their content on top of the larger general model?

                              <span>I made a mistake and bought a GPU that is not compatible with my motherboard. I found a P100 for $300 on ebay and bought it, but didn&#x27;t research far enough to figure out that it isn&#x27;t designed for a workstation motherboard. Is there any way I can externally mount it without spending tons on a GPU server? I am not sure just a PCIe riser will do the trick, since the GPU draws 250W and will also need a cooling system.
 Is it over?

                              <span>Datasets like FFHQ consist of face images crawled from the Internet. While those images are published under CC licenses, the authors usually have not obtained consent from each person depicted in those images. I guess that&#x27;s why they are taking takedown requests: People can send requests to remove their faces from the dataset.
 However, I&#x27;m always confused about one thing: Some faces images are already used in the paper. If those people request takedown of their images, wouldn&#x27;t that result in a withdrawl of the paper? Or is there any &quot;fair use&quot; statement that can prevent this from happening?

                              <span>As we’re developing Sweep, our open-source AI junior developer, we implemented a new architecture for our vector search database.
 We decided on two main goals for our code search infrastructure:
  
The search index needs to be up to date. Code is unique from other types of content in that it requires high levels of consistency. You wouldn’t want to reference an old version of a function(say two git commits back) while writing something that uses it.
 For additional security, we don’t want to store the code as plaintext. However, we still need a way to map the original code to the embeddings.
  
Efficient Indexing
 Problem:
 We wanted to store multiple repositories in a scalable manner without relying on a hosted vector database like Pinecone.

                              <span>I’m already doing work that involves creating prompts for LLM’s. I adore cleaning data and training models and worry that ML solutions will soon become asking chatbots to do what you want in plain English, and all this time I’ve spent learning about how ML is done on a technical level will just be auxiliary literature that doesn’t help me in my profession. What will our expertise move to? Being able to ask a chatbot the right questions? 
 How will our profession change?

                              <span>Dear community
 I am currently despairing of a school project.
 The task is to develop a text classifier. So far so good. The problem is that I have a dataset with 200k texts that are not labeled. These should be classified to 190 classes, which are additionally very domain specific. However, several classes could also apply to one text.
 Does anyone know a good approach how to approach this?
 I have already determined 10 keywords for each class. But I don&#x27;t know how to proceed now.
 It would be very nice if someone could help me. Gladly also only by buzzwords.
 Many greetings

 I am looking for feedback on the open source project Cephalon! Cephalon is a framework for building machine-learning applications. It aims to be similar to Django. Django is a batteries included framework for building backend of a website, and Cephalon is a batteries included framework for building Machine Learning applications in Rust. I want to get feedback from you because, I want to make building machine-learning apps easier for any new-comers. I think with a solid framework, they can focus more on the core concepts, rather than DevOps or MLOps. 
 There is a survey you can fill out here
 Or message me if you want to discuss more! 
 You can find the original project here
 Or find it on crates.io here
 I hope you have an amazing rest of the week! 😁 Thank you in advance for any feedback!!

 TL;DR
 We’re releasing Data Engine – a new set of tools that helps machine learning practitioners, collect and manage unstructured data, visualize it, send it to annotation, and turn it into a data loader for training. I wanted to share our reasons for building it and the challenges it solves and hopefully spark a discussion. You can check out the full launch blog here: dagshub.com/blog/launching-data-engine-toolset-for-unstructured-datasets/
 Data Engine Flow
 Sorry for the long post – I wanted to share our considerations for building this toolkit, and hopefully spark a discussion about your processes for iterating on datasets…</span>

                              <span>WormGPT is a criminal AI. It’s something that enables crime versus something like offensive jokes like 4chanGPT. EU and China pumped out all this regulation thinking they were ahead of the world when in all reality it’s freaking backwards.
 If AI was a physical commodity like goods and services, yes regulation is effective. However AI regulation is just won’t stop bad actors. The law already covers most of the dangers involved.
 Trying to regulate AI models is like trying to regulate piracy. We need to regulate the people, not the technology. 
 Disinformation campaigns? Nail them for libel. Creating a model designed solely to enable crime? Nail the people for the crimes they are doing. Nail them for possessing criminal tools. 
 People are easier to regulate than specifics on AI that’s easy to self replicate. Especially considering companies going to lobby their business interest. 
 This is my opinion on the criminal AI, what about yours? (This model may also be using LLama weights considering it’s generations and timing)

 On their quest to find the perfect beer our team of Czech Computer Vision and AI experts developed a solution that takes certain visual indicators of the perfect beer into account and applies Computer Vision to detect these.
 So, what are these visual indicators that determine the perfect pint? Let&#x27;s dive in! First up, we have the &quot;beer ratio.&quot; Each brand has its own glass, and the beer should be drafted within specific markings. Whether it&#x27;s a single line or a range between logo points, Beer Inspector ensures you get what you paid for! No more guessing about your beer&#x27;s quantity. 📏
 Next, we have the &quot;beer head structure.&quot; This is crucial for the ultimate beer experience. Airtight, thick, and no air bubbles – that&#x27;s the way to go! Beer…</span>

                              <span>I am running text inferencing on Llama2-7b through langchain. I have downloaded the model from langchain&#x27;s Huggingface library, and I am running the model on AWS ml.g4dn.12xlarge which has 4xnvidia t4, which gives a total 64GB of GPU memory and 192GB of normal memory. It is able to answer my queries in around 10 seconds for small queries, and upto 3 mins for big queries.
 The task I am doing is retrieving information from a document(Understanding Machine Learning PDF) in a conversational way. I&#x27;ve extracted the main parts of the notebook and put it up here.
 Where can I make changes to speed up the transaction. Is there any change I can do in the model configuration to speed it up? Because if I use HuggingFaceHubAPI, it is able to give an answer in less than 5 seconds. Are there any other areas I can optimise?
 I appreciate any help you can provide. Thanks!

                              <span>I was looking libraries like DISTIL and I would like to test a toy-example with all these modern uncertainty functions like BatchBALD, Glister, etc
 All the implementations of these functions seems to be on a NN or CNN. I know some of them like BatchBALD were created on top of a CNN with Monte-Carlo Dropout -- even BALD originally was created on top of SVM.
 It seems many of these approaches are under the category &quot;Query by Committee&quot;and they are an ensemble of models
 I just would like to test a simple LogisticRegression and use the log_proba and an output for these strategies. Someone knows if this is possible?

                              <span>What are the empirical rules that one has to have in mind when designing a network, choosing hyperparameters, etc?
 For example:
  
Linear scaling rule: the learning rate should be scaled linearly with the batch size [ref] (on resnets on Imagenet) 
 
Chinchilla law: compute budget, model size and training data should be scaled equally [ref]
 
 Do you have any other? (if possible with article, or even better an article with many of them)

                              <span>For pretraining I just sent batches of 1024 tokens and didn&#x27;t worry about padding. But for finetuning, I intend to use a padding token to make all the &quot;instructions&quot; 1024 tokens in length. But some of them are only 10 tokens, which means 99% padding tokens. I feel like that would affect the model, and perhaps those padding tokens should be masked.
 Should I mask out those padding tokens? I can see that there&#x27;s a parameter for attention mask, and I could make one and pass it in. But I&#x27;m not sure if that&#x27;s the intended usage. I&#x27;m seeing conflicting and ambiguous information on this point. It&#x27;s unclear to me whether the attn_mask is intended for customizing the casual left to right attention of the model, instead of for masking padding tokens. I&#x27;m worried I might be interfering with the process if I use that attn_mask.
 Here I can see attn_mask is an accepted parameter:
 y &#x3D; torch.nn.functional.scaled_dot_product_attention(q, k, v, attn_mask&#x3D;None, dropout_p&#x3D;self.dropout if self.training else 0, is_causal&#x3D;True) 
 FYI, I&#x27;m using NanoGPT which is based on Pytorch (not Hugging Face Transformers).
 Should I apply the attention mask on the padding tokens in this context?

For some context, I am making a neural network from scratch in C++, just as a little project I find interesting. I&#x27;m working on a digit classification task using the MNIST dataset, and my network is composed of one hidden layer, consisting of 100 nodes, and an output layer with 10 nodes, each corresponding to a digit (0 to 9). To train the network, I&#x27;m using the Mean Squared Error (MSE) cost function, where the cost is calculated as (actualNodeActivation - expectedNodeActivation)^2 and as my activation function I am using the sigmoid function. The actual algorithm I am employing is backpropagation.
 The issue I&#x27;m encountering is that regardless of the input data, my n…</span>

                              <span>Hi! I am kind of new to Reinforcement Learning and Im trying to implement a PPO in CarRacing enviroment but I am failing to get the model to work. I have managed to get the model working with a DQN but with the PPO I can&#x27;t seem to get the exploration right as it ends up either going forward all time or in circles. 
 I have looked into my code for days, but haven&#x27;t been able to find an error that would cause this. (Does not say much as I am kind of a newbie to RL). I would be grateful if someone could give me a hand. This is my source code:

 Btw I also tried without greyscaling and it did the same.

                              <span>I temporarily switched from Rust to Python for machine learning, but quickly became fed up with Python&#x27;s annoying versioning issues and runtime errors. I looked for a better path to machine learning and discovered burn, a deep learning framework for Rust. As my first burn project I decided to port OpenAI&#x27;s Whisper transcription model. The project can be found at Gadersd/whisper-burn: A Rust implementation of OpenAI&#x27;s Whisper model using the burn framework (github.com). I based it on the excellently concise tinygrad implementation that can be found here. The tinygrad version begrudgingly uses Torch&#x27;s stft which I ported into a pure Rust short time Fourier transform along with the mel scale frequency conversion matrix function because I am curious and just a bit masochistic.
 Now for the good and the bad of burn. Rust&#x27;s excellent package manager solves much of the versioning pain experienced in Python so burn models can be less painful to deploy and come with added reliability. The type checking in burn catches some tensor operation errors at compile time such as trying to multiply matrices of incompatible dimensions. Burn supports wgpu and WebGPU and can run in the browser when compiled into web assembly. I see a bright future for model deployment in burn.
 However, burn is relatively new so it lacks many tensor operations such as abs() that are available in other frameworks. Some features such as quantization are also missing. Burn implementations tend to be more verbose than the equivalent Python versions. Some of the runtime errors that plague PyTorch are still around in burn such as the crashes that result from trying to multiply tensors that live on different devices.
 Overall, burn is currently less ergonomic to develop with than alternatives such as PyTorch, but I think it has a lot of potential. If it is eagerly cultivated it may grow into a great Rusty alternative for machine learning practitioners.
 What do you all think?

I trained the model and documented the results.. however, it&#x27;s considered old technology now and we switched to solve the same problem using LLM.I was wondering if I can write a research paper for the BERT approach and publish it that can help me pursue PhD or Masters. How to start the discussion with my manager and seniors ?

                              <span>Hi,
 I&#x27;m trying to implement AL for ImageClassification. I have seen people using DAL, where some works use MC-DropOut to be able to calculate uncertainty on DNN / CNN. This also seems to be a current research topic. 
 It seems very appealing for me to use DAL on the context of ImageClassification. However, I&#x27;m thinking to use a different and maybe naive approach: 
 I thought to use TL (with or without FN) on a well knowledge DL Acthrecture (e.g.: Resnet) for Feature Extraction. Then, I just use the extracted features to train a Classical AL framework (e.g.: using LogisticRegression) 
 Some thoughts/questions I had and would like to discuss:
 ​
  
I&#x27;m not finding articles that do this. Someone knows if this is approach is super naive or is a valid approach? What would be the drawbacks doing that?
 To train a DAL from scratch makes sense? For example, I saw some articles training DL Archthrectures from scratch, but this probably will require a lot of data, no?

                              <span>Yo, I&#x27;m new to all this so bear with me. I&#x27;m doing project in python where i create a linear regression from scratch (with numpy and pandas). I was watching this lady tutorial on it, at https://youtu.be/ltXSoduiVwY?t&#x3D;277 she shows the partial derrivatives for updating the weights and bias. Later when she is implementing it she doesn&#x27;t use the 2 before the X and uses only the dot product. Is it math magic where the 2 dosn&#x27;t have to be there or did she forget. Btw it still works fine without the 2 but still... I just need to know. Thanks for the answer and sorry if I&#x27;m asking something obvious

                              <span>So, Nvdia is technically the best in this AI department. (For now 24/07/2023)
 Budget - (200 - 300)$
 Official Prices in Amazon
 1 ) Intel arc A750 8 GB Amazon price - 219$
 2 ) RX 7600 OC 8 GB Amazon price - 269$
 3 ) RTX 3060 12 GB Amazon price - 284$
 Here we see that Arc A750 is about 60 $ cheaper but price in different country is different. In my country Bangladesh the prices are as follow
 Official Prices in Bangladesh
 1 ) Intel arc A750 8 GB Startech (Bangladesh) price - 285$ (cheapest)
 2 ) RX 7600 OC 8 GB Startech (Bangladesh) price - 327$ (cheapest)
 3 ) RTX 3060 12 GB Startech (Bangladesh) price - 401$ (cheapest)
 4)Intel arc A770 16 GB Startech (Bangladesh) price - 421$ (cheapest)
 Now the difference is more than 100 $ and both AMD and RTX are out of budget.
 AMD just isn&#x27;t that good with Ai in any way.
 Nvdia is the best. (Not price to performance.
 Intel Arc is new but has better capabilities in AI than AMD. But its drivers are bad for AI for now)
 Now thinking if the intel drivers for Ai get better and optimized as its already somewhat better for games.
 Will the arc a750 be better than the RTX 3060 12 GB ?
 Will the arc a770 capitalize on Vram and beat all nvdia budget gpus after the drivers are fixed only for 20 more dollars than rtx 3060?
 Which is better for future proofing (theoritically) from these budget gpus ? If its arc then I will gamble its chances of surviving in the future and buy it now.

                              <span>Linear regression is a statistical technique for estimating the relationship between two variables. A simple example of linear regression is to predict the height of someone based on the square root of the person’s weight (that’s what BMI is based on). To do this, we need to find the slope and intercept of the line. […]

                              <span>Two-dimensional tensors are analogous to two-dimensional metrics. Like a two-dimensional metric, a two-dimensional tensor also has $n$ number of rows and columns. Let’s take a gray-scale image as an example, which is a two-dimensional matrix of numeric values, commonly known as pixels. Ranging from ‘0’ to ‘255’, each number represents a pixel intensity value. Here, […]

                              <span>My husband Jeremy and I never intended to homeschool, and yet we have now, unexpectedly, committed to homeschooling long-term. Prior to the pandemic, we both worked full-time in careers that we loved and found meaningful, and we sent our daughter to a full-day Montessori school. Although I struggled with significant health issues, I felt unbelievably lucky and fulfilled in both my family life and my professional life. The pandemic upended my careful balance. Every family is different, with different needs, circumstances, and constraints, and what works for one may not work for others. My intention here is primarily to share the journey of my own (very privileged) family.
