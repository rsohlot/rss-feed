                    <span>The rapid growth of data in the recent years has led to the development of
complex learning algorithms that are often used to make decisions in real
world. While the positive impact of the algorithms has been tremendous, there
is a need to mitigate any bias arising from either training samples or implicit
assumptions made about the data samples. This need becomes critical when
algorithms are used in automated decision making systems that can hugely impact
people&#x27;s lives.

Many approaches have been proposed to make learning algorithms fair by
detecting and mitigating bias in different stages of optimization. However, due
to a lack of a universal definition of fairness, these algorithms optimize for
a particular interpretation of fairness which makes them limited for real world
use. Moreover, an underlying assumption that is common to all algorithms is the
apparent equivalence of achieving fairness and removing bias. In other words,
there is no user defined criteria that can be incorporated into the
optimization procedure for producing a fair algorithm. Motivated by these
shortcomings of existing methods, we propose the CONFAIR procedure that
produces a fair algorithm by incorporating user constraints into the
optimization procedure. Furthermore, we make the process interpretable by
estimating the most predictive features from data. We demonstrate the efficacy
of our approach on several real world datasets using different fairness
criteria.</span>

                    <span>In this paper, we introduce ML-Decoder, a new attention-based classification
head. ML-Decoder predicts the existence of class labels via queries, and
enables better utilization of spatial data compared to global average pooling.
By redesigning the decoder architecture, and using a novel group-decoding
scheme, ML-Decoder is highly efficient, and can scale well to thousands of
classes. Compared to using a larger backbone, ML-Decoder consistently provides
a better speed-accuracy trade-off. ML-Decoder is also versatile - it can be
used as a drop-in replacement for various classification heads, and generalize
to unseen classes when operated with word queries. Novel query augmentations
further improve its generalization ability. Using ML-Decoder, we achieve
state-of-the-art results on several classification tasks: on MS-COCO
multi-label, we reach 91.4% mAP; on NUS-WIDE zero-shot, we reach 31.1% ZSL mAP;
and on ImageNet single-label, we reach with vanilla ResNet50 backbone a new top
score of 80.7%, without extra data or distillation. Public code is available

                    <span>Reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms assume that users specify tasks by
manually writing down a reward function. However, this process can be laborious
and demands considerable technical expertise. Can we devise RL algorithms that
instead enable users to specify tasks simply by providing examples of
successful outcomes? In this paper, we derive a control algorithm that
maximizes the future probability of these successful outcome examples. Prior
work has approached similar problems with a two-stage process, first learning a
reward function and then optimizing this reward function using another RL
algorithm. In contrast, our method directly learns a value function from
transitions and successful outcomes, without learning this intermediate reward
function. Our method therefore requires fewer hyperparameters to tune and lines
of code to debug. We show that our method satisfies a new data-driven Bellman
equation, where examples take the place of the typical reward function term.
Experiments show that our approach outperforms prior methods that learn
explicit reward functions.</span>

                    <span>There has been an emerging paradigm shift from the era of &quot;internet AI&quot; to
&quot;embodied AI&quot;, where AI algorithms and agents no longer learn from datasets of
images, videos or text curated primarily from the internet. Instead, they learn
through interactions with their environments from an egocentric perception
similar to humans. Consequently, there has been substantial growth in the
demand for embodied AI simulators to support various embodied AI research
tasks. This growing interest in embodied AI is beneficial to the greater
pursuit of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), but there has not been a
contemporary and comprehensive survey of this field. This paper aims to provide
an encyclopedic survey for the field of embodied AI, from its simulators to its
research. By evaluating nine current embodied AI simulators with our proposed
seven features, this paper aims to understand the simulators in their provision
for use in embodied AI research and their limitations. Lastly, this paper
surveys the three main research tasks in embodied AI -- visual exploration,
visual navigation and embodied question answering (QA), covering the
state-of-the-art approaches, evaluation metrics and datasets. Finally, with the
new insights revealed through surveying the field, the paper will provide
suggestions for simulator-for-task selections and recommendations for the
future directions of the field.</span>

                    <span>We present a simple and intuitive approach for interactive control of
physically simulated characters. Our work builds upon generative adversarial
networks (GAN) and reinforcement learning, and introduces an imitation learning
framework where an ensemble of classifiers and an imitation policy are trained
in tandem given pre-processed reference clips. The classifiers are trained to
discriminate the reference motion from the motion generated by the imitation
policy, while the policy is rewarded for fooling the discriminators. Using our
GAN-based approach, multiple motor control policies can be trained separately
to imitate different behaviors. In runtime, our system can respond to external
control signal provided by the user and interactively switch between different
policies. Compared to existing methods, our proposed approach has the following
attractive properties: 1) achieves state-of-the-art imitation performance
without manually designing and fine tuning a reward function; 2) directly
controls the character without having to track any target reference pose
explicitly or implicitly through a phase state; and 3) supports interactive
policy switching without requiring any motion generation or motion matching
mechanism. We highlight the applicability of our approach in a range of
imitation and interactive control tasks, while also demonstrating its ability
to withstand external perturbations as well as to recover balance. Overall, our
approach generates high-fidelity motion, has low runtime cost, and can be
easily integrated into interactive applications and games.</span>

                    <span>This article presents a new way to study the theory of regularized learning
for generalized data in Banach spaces including representer theorems and
convergence theorems. The generalized data are composed of linear functionals
and real scalars as the input and output elements to represent the discrete
information of different local models. By the extension of the classical
machine learning, the empirical risks are computed by the generalized data and
the loss functions. According to the techniques of regularization, the exact
solutions are approximated globally by minimizing the regularized empirical
risks over the Banach spaces. The existence and convergence of the approximate
solutions are guaranteed by the relative compactness of the generalized input
data in the predual spaces of the Banach spaces.</span>

                    <span>Supervision for image-to-image translation (I2I) tasks is hard to come by,
but bears significant effect on the resulting quality. In this paper, we
observe that for many Unsupervised I2I (UI2I) scenarios, one domain is more
familiar than the other, and offers in-domain prior knowledge, such as semantic
segmentation. We argue that for complex scenes, figuring out the semantic
structure of the domain is hard, especially with no supervision, but is an
important part of a successful I2I operation. We hence introduce two techniques
to incorporate this invaluable in-domain prior knowledge for the benefit of
translation quality: through a novel Multi-Stream generator architecture, and
through a semantic segmentation-based regularization loss term. In essence, we
propose splitting the input data according to semantic masks, explicitly
guiding the network to different behavior for the different regions of the
image. In addition, we propose training a semantic segmentation network along
with the translation task, and to leverage this output as a loss term that
improves robustness. We validate our approach on urban data, demonstrating
superior quality in the challenging UI2I tasks of converting day images to
night ones. In addition, we also demonstrate how reinforcing the target dataset
with our augmented images improves the training of downstream tasks such as the
classical detection one.</span>

have achieved scalable Gaussian process inference with highly accurate point
predictions, in several implementations these iterative methods appear to
struggle with numerical instabilities in learning kernel hyperparameters, and
poor test likelihoods. By investigating CG tolerance, preconditioner rank, and
Lanczos decomposition rank, we provide a particularly simple prescription to
correct these issues: we recommend that one should use a small CG tolerance
($\epsilon \leq 0.01$) and a large root decomposition size ($r \geq 5000$).
Moreover, we show that L-BFGS-B is a compelling optimizer for Iterative GPs,
achieving convergence with fewer gradient updates.</span>

                    <span>Digitized documents such as scientific articles, tax forms, invoices,
contract papers, historic texts are widely used nowadays. These document images
could be degraded or damaged due to various reasons including poor lighting
conditions, shadow, distortions like noise and blur, aging, ink stain,
bleed-through, watermark, stamp, etc. Document image enhancement plays a
crucial role as a pre-processing step in many automated document analysis and
recognition tasks such as character recognition. With recent advances in deep
learning, many methods are proposed to enhance the quality of these document
images. In this paper, we review deep learning-based methods, datasets, and
metrics for six main document image enhancement tasks, including binarization,
debluring, denoising, defading, watermark removal, and shadow removal. We
summarize the recent works for each task and discuss their features,
challenges, and limitations. We introduce multiple document image enhancement
tasks that have received little to no attention, including over and under
exposure correction, super resolution, and bleed-through removal. We identify
several promising research directions and opportunities for future research.</span>

                    <span>We consider the data-driven discovery of governing equations from time-series
data in the limit of high noise. The algorithms developed describe an extensive
toolkit of methods for circumventing the deleterious effects of noise in the
context of the sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics (SINDy) framework.
We offer two primary contributions, both focused on noisy data acquired from a
system x&#x27; &#x3D; f(x). First, we propose, for use in high-noise settings, an
extensive toolkit of critically enabling extensions for the SINDy regression
method, to progressively cull functionals from an over-complete library and
yield a set of sparse equations that regress to the derivate x&#x27;. These
innovations can extract sparse governing equations and coefficients from
high-noise time-series data (e.g. 300% added noise). For example, it discovers
the correct sparse libraries in the Lorenz system, with median coefficient
estimate errors equal to 1% - 3% (for 50% noise), 6% - 8% (for 100% noise); and
23% - 25% (for 300% noise). The enabling modules in the toolkit are combined
into a single method, but the individual modules can be tactically applied in
other equation discovery methods (SINDy or not) to improve results on
high-noise data. Second, we propose a technique, applicable to any model
discovery method based on x&#x27; &#x3D; f(x), to assess the accuracy of a discovered
model in the context of non-unique solutions due to noisy data. Currently, this
non-uniqueness can obscure a discovered model&#x27;s accuracy and thus a discovery
method&#x27;s effectiveness. We describe a technique that uses linear dependencies
among functionals to transform a discovered model into an equivalent form that
is closest to the true model, enabling more accurate assessment of a discovered
model&#x27;s accuracy.</span>

                    <span>Bayesian models of behavior have provided computational level explanations in
a range of psychophysical tasks. One fundamental experimental paradigm is the
production or reproduction task, in which subjects are instructed to generate
an action that either reproduces a previously sensed stimulus magnitude or
achieves a target response. This type of task therefore distinguishes itself
from other psychophysical tasks in that the responses are on a continuum and
effort plays an important role with increasing response magnitude. Based on
Bayesian decision theory we present an inference method to recover perceptual
uncertainty, response variability, and the cost function underlying human
responses. Crucially, the cost function is parameterized such that effort is
explicitly included. We present a hybrid inference method employing MCMC
sampling utilizing appropriate proposal distributions and an inner loop
utilizing amortized inference with a neural network that approximates the mode
of the optimal response distribution. We show how this model can be utilized to
avoid unidentifiability of experimental designs and that parameters can be
recovered through validation on synthetic and application to experimental data.
Our approach will enable behavioral scientists to perform Bayesian inference of
decision making parameters in production and reproduction tasks.</span>

                    <span>The celebrated Takens&#x27; embedding theorem concerns embedding an attractor of a
dynamical system in a Euclidean space of appropriate dimension through a
generic delay-observation map. The embedding also establishes a topological
conjugacy. In this paper, we show how an arbitrary sequence can be mapped into
another space as an attractive solution of a nonautonomous dynamical system.
Such mapping also entails a topological conjugacy and an embedding between the
sequence and the attractive solution spaces. This result is not a
generalization of Takens embedding theorem but helps us understand what exactly
is required by discrete-time state space models widely used in applications to
embed an external stimulus onto its solution space. Our results settle another
basic problem concerning the perturbation of an autonomous dynamical system. We
describe what exactly happens to the dynamics when exogenous noise perturbs
continuously a local irreducible attracting set (such as a stable fixed point)
of a discrete-time autonomous dynamical system.</span>

                    <span>The H-measure is a classifier performance measure which takes into account
the context of application without requiring a rigid value of relative
misclassification costs to be set. Since its introduction in 2009 it has become
widely adopted. This paper answers various queries which users have raised
since its introduction, including questions about its interpretation, the
choice of a weighting function, whether it is strictly proper, and its
coherence, and relates the measure to other work.</span>

                    <span>Partial differential equations (PDEs) play a dominant role in the
mathematical modeling of many complex dynamical processes. Solving these PDEs
often requires prohibitively high computational costs, especially when multiple
evaluations must be made for different parameters or conditions. After
training, neural operators can provide PDEs solutions significantly faster than
traditional PDE solvers. In this work, invariance properties and computational
complexity of two neural operators are examined for transport PDE of a scalar
quantity. Neural operator based on graph kernel network (GKN) operates on
graph-structured data to incorporate nonlocal dependencies. Here we propose a
modified formulation of GKN to achieve frame invariance. Vector cloud neural
network (VCNN) is an alternate neural operator with embedded frame invariance
which operates on point cloud data. GKN-based neural operator demonstrates
slightly better predictive performance compared to VCNN. However, GKN requires
an excessively high computational cost that increases quadratically with the
increasing number of discretized objects as compared to a linear increase for
VCNN.</span>

                    <span>Federated edge learning (FEEL) has emerged as an effective approach to reduce
the large communication latency in Cloud-based machine learning solutions,
while preserving data privacy. Unfortunately, the learning performance of FEEL
may be compromised due to limited training data in a single edge cluster. In
this paper, we investigate a novel framework of FEEL, namely semi-decentralized
federated edge learning (SD-FEEL). By allowing model aggregation across
different edge clusters, SD-FEEL enjoys the benefit of FEEL in reducing the
training latency, while improving the learning performance by accessing richer
training data from multiple edge clusters. A training algorithm for SD-FEEL
with three main procedures in each round is presented, including local model
updates, intra-cluster and inter-cluster model aggregations, which is proved to
converge on non-independent and identically distributed (non-IID) data. We also
characterize the interplay between the network topology of the edge servers and
the communication overhead of inter-cluster model aggregation on the training
performance. Experiment results corroborate our analysis and demonstrate the
effectiveness of SD-FFEL in achieving faster convergence than traditional
federated learning architectures. Besides, guidelines on choosing critical
hyper-parameters of the training algorithm are also provided.</span>

rule and $\phi$-convex for online optimization in normed vector space using
dynamic regret as the performance metric. In combing the update rules, we start
with strategy $S$ (a two-parameter variant strategy covering Optimistic-FTRL
with surrogate linearized losses), and obtain $S$-I (type-I relaxation variant
form of $S$) and $S$-II (type-II relaxation variant form of $S$, which is
Optimistic-MD) by relaxation. Regret bounds for $S$-I and $S$-II are the
tightest possible. As instantiations, regret bounds of normalized exponentiated
subgradient and greedy/lazy projection are better than the currently known
optimal results. By replacing losses of online game with monotone operators,
and extending the definition of regret, namely regret$^n$, we extend online
convex optimization to online monotone optimization, which expands the
application scope of $S$-I and $S$-II.</span>

                    <span>Approximate message passing (AMP) is a promising technique for unknown signal
reconstruction of certain high-dimensional linear systems with non-Gaussian
signaling. A distinguished feature of the AMP-type algorithms is that their
dynamics can be rigorously described by state evolution. However, state
evolution does not necessarily guarantee the convergence of iterative
algorithms. To solve the convergence problem of AMP-type algorithms in
principle, this paper proposes a memory AMP (MAMP) under a sufficient statistic
condition, named sufficient statistic MAMP (SS-MAMP). We show that the
covariance matrices of SS-MAMP are L-banded and convergent. Given an arbitrary
MAMP, we can construct an SS-MAMP by damping, which not only ensures the
convergence of MAMP but also preserves the orthogonality of MAMP, i.e., its
dynamics can be rigorously described by state evolution. As a byproduct, we
prove that the Bayes-optimal orthogonal/vector AMP (BO-OAMP/VAMP) is an
SS-MAMP. As a result, we reveal two interesting properties of BO-OAMP/VAMP for
large systems: 1) the covariance matrices are L-banded and are convergent in
BO-OAMP/VAMP, and 2) damping and memory are useless (i.e., do not bring
performance improvement) in BO-OAMP/VAMP. As an example, we construct a
sufficient statistic Bayes-optimal MAMP (BO-MAMP), which is Bayes optimal if
its state evolution has a unique fixed point and its MSE is not worse than the
original BO-MAMP. Finally, simulations are provided to verify the validity and
accuracy of the theoretical results.</span>

gained a lot of attention in both machine learning and AI domains. In
particular, optimal transport has been used to develop probability metrics
between probability distributions. We introduce in this paper an independence
criterion based on entropy regularized optimal transport. Our criterion can be
used to test for independence between two samples. We establish non-asymptotic
bounds for our test statistic, and study its statistical behavior under both
the null and alternative hypothesis. Our theoretical results involve tools from
U-process theory and optimal transport theory. We present experimental results
on existing benchmarks, illustrating the interest of the proposed criterion.</span>

                    <span>The gradient noise of Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) is considered to play
a key role in its properties (e.g. escaping low potential points and
regularization). Past research has indicated that the covariance of the SGD
error done via minibatching plays a critical role in determining its
regularization and escape from low potential points. It is however not much
explored how much the distribution of the error influences the behavior of the
algorithm. Motivated by some new research in this area, we prove universality
results by showing that noise classes that have the same mean and covariance
structure of SGD via minibatching have similar properties. We mainly consider
the Multiplicative Stochastic Gradient Descent (M-SGD) algorithm as introduced
by Wu et al., which has a much more general noise class than the SGD algorithm
done via minibatching. We establish nonasymptotic bounds for the M-SGD
algorithm mainly with respect to the Stochastic Differential Equation
corresponding to SGD via minibatching. We also show that the M-SGD error is
approximately a scaled Gaussian distribution with mean $0$ at any fixed point
of the M-SGD algorithm. We also establish bounds for the convergence of the
M-SGD algorithm in the strongly convex regime.</span>

                    <span>The importance of deep learning data privacy has gained significant attention
in recent years. It is probably to suffer data breaches when applying deep
learning to cryptocurrency that lacks supervision of financial regulatory
agencies. However, there is little relative research in the financial area to
our best knowledge. We apply two representative deep learning privacy-privacy
frameworks proposed by Google to financial trading data. We designed the
experiments with several different parameters suggested from the original
studies. In addition, we refer the degree of privacy to Google and Apple
companies to estimate the results more reasonably. The results show that DP-SGD
performs better than the PATE framework in financial trading data. The tradeoff
between privacy and accuracy is low in DP-SGD. The degree of privacy also is in
line with the actual case. Therefore, we can obtain a strong privacy guarantee
with precision to avoid potential financial loss.</span>

                    <span>Score-based generative models (SGMs) have demonstrated remarkable synthesis
quality. SGMs rely on a diffusion process that gradually perturbs the data
towards a tractable distribution, while the generative model learns to denoise.
The complexity of this denoising task is, apart from the data distribution
itself, uniquely determined by the diffusion process. We argue that current
SGMs employ overly simplistic diffusions, leading to unnecessarily complex
denoising processes, which limit generative modeling performance. Based on
connections to statistical mechanics, we propose a novel critically-damped
Langevin diffusion (CLD) and show that CLD-based SGMs achieve superior
performance. CLD can be interpreted as running a joint diffusion in an extended
space, where the auxiliary variables can be considered &quot;velocities&quot; that are
coupled to the data variables as in Hamiltonian dynamics. We derive a novel
score matching objective for CLD and show that the model only needs to learn
the score function of the conditional distribution of the velocity given data,
an easier task than learning scores of the data directly. We also derive a new
sampling scheme for efficient synthesis from CLD-based diffusion models. We
find that CLD outperforms previous SGMs in synthesis quality for similar
network architectures and sampling compute budgets. We show that our novel
sampler for CLD significantly outperforms solvers such as Euler--Maruyama. Our
framework provides new insights into score-based denoising diffusion models and
can be readily used for high-resolution image synthesis. Project page and code:

                    <span>Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are acknowledged as vulnerable to adversarial
attacks, while the existing black-box attacks require extensive queries on the
victim DNN to achieve high success rates. For query-efficiency, surrogate
models of the victim are used to generate transferable Adversarial Examples
(AEs) because of their Gradient Similarity (GS), i.e., surrogates&#x27; attack
gradients are similar to the victim&#x27;s ones. However, it is generally neglected
to exploit their similarity on outputs, namely the Prediction Similarity (PS),
to filter out inefficient queries by surrogates without querying the victim. To
jointly utilize and also optimize surrogates&#x27; GS and PS, we develop QueryNet, a
unified attack framework that can significantly reduce queries. QueryNet
creatively attacks by multi-identity surrogates, i.e., crafts several AEs for
one sample by different surrogates, and also uses surrogates to decide on the
most promising AE for the query. After that, the victim&#x27;s query feedback is
accumulated to optimize not only surrogates&#x27; parameters but also their
architectures, enhancing both the GS and the PS. Although QueryNet has no
access to pre-trained surrogates&#x27; prior, it reduces queries by averagely about
an order of magnitude compared to alternatives within an acceptable time,
according to our comprehensive experiments: 11 victims (including two
commercial models) on MNIST/CIFAR10/ImageNet, allowing only 8-bit image

disentangled representations. Unsupervised learning is known to be brittle even
on toy datasets and a meaningful, mathematically precise definition of
disentanglement remains difficult to find. Here we investigate the original

                    <span>The statefulness property of network protocol implementations poses a unique
challenge for testing and verification techniques, including Fuzzing. Stateful
fuzzers tackle this challenge by leveraging state models to partition the state
space and assist the test generation process. Since not all states are equally
important and fuzzing campaigns have time limits, fuzzers need effective state
selection algorithms to prioritize progressive states over others. Several
state selection algorithms have been proposed but they were implemented and
evaluated separately on different platforms, making it hard to achieve
conclusive findings. In this work, we evaluate an extensive set of state
selection algorithms on the same fuzzing platform that is AFLNet, a
state-of-the-art fuzzer for network servers. The algorithm set includes
existing ones supported by AFLNet and our novel and principled algorithm called
AFLNetLegion. The experimental results on the ProFuzzBench benchmark show that
(i) the existing state selection algorithms of AFLNet achieve very similar code
coverage, (ii) AFLNetLegion clearly outperforms these algorithms in selected
case studies, but (iii) the overall improvement appears insignificant. These
are unexpected yet interesting findings. We identify problems and share

                    <span>The latest advances of statistical physics have shown remarkable performance
of machine learning in identifying phase transitions. In this paper, we apply
domain adversarial neural network (DANN) based on transfer learning to studying
non-equilibrium and equilibrium phase transition models, which are percolation
model and directed percolation (DP) model, respectively. With the DANN, only a
small fraction of input configurations (2d images) needs to be labeled, which
is automatically chosen, in order to capture the critical point. To learn the
DP model, the method is refined by an iterative procedure in determining the
critical point, which is a prerequisite for the data collapse in calculating
the critical exponent $\nu_{\perp}$. We then apply the DANN to a
two-dimensional site percolation with configurations filtered to include only
the largest cluster which may contain the information related to the order
parameter. The DANN learning of both models yields reliable results which are
comparable to the ones from Monte Carlo simulations. Our study also shows that
the DANN can achieve quite high accuracy at much lower cost, compared to the
supervised learning.</span>

                    <span>Continual learning requires models to learn new tasks while maintaining
previously learned knowledge. Various algorithms have been proposed to address
this real challenge. Till now, rehearsal-based methods, such as experience
replay, have achieved state-of-the-art performance. These approaches save a
small part of the data of the past tasks as a memory buffer to prevent models
from forgetting previously learned knowledge. However, most of them treat every
new task equally, i.e., fixed the hyperparameters of the framework while
learning different new tasks. Such a setting lacks the consideration of the
relationship/similarity between past and new tasks. For example, the previous
knowledge/features learned from dogs are more beneficial for the identification
of cats (new task), compared to those learned from buses. In this regard, we
propose a meta learning algorithm based on bi-level optimization to adaptively
tune the relationship between the knowledge extracted from the past and new
tasks. Therefore, the model can find an appropriate direction of gradient
during continual learning and avoid the serious overfitting problem on memory
buffer. Extensive experiments are conducted on three publicly available
datasets (i.e., CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and Tiny ImageNet). The experimental
results demonstrate that the proposed method can consistently improve the
performance of all baselines.</span>

                    <span>A trivializing map is a field transformation whose Jacobian determinant
exactly cancels the interaction terms in the action, providing a representation
of the theory in terms of a deterministic transformation of a distribution from
which sampling is trivial. Recently, a proof-of-principle study by Albergo,
Kanwar and Shanahan [arXiv:1904.12072] demonstrated that approximations of
trivializing maps can be &#x60;machine-learned&#x27; by a class of invertible,
differentiable neural models called \textit{normalizing flows}. By ensuring
that the Jacobian determinant can be computed efficiently, asymptotically exact
sampling from the theory of interest can be performed by drawing samples from a
simple distribution and passing them through the network. From a theoretical
perspective, this approach has the potential to become more efficient than
traditional Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampling techniques, where
autocorrelations severely diminish the sampling efficiency as one approaches
the continuum limit. A major caveat is that it is not yet understood how the
size of models and the cost of training them is expected to scale. As a first
step, we have conducted an exploratory scaling study using two-dimensional
$\phi^4$ with up to $20^2$ lattice sites. Although the scope of our study is
limited to a particular model architecture and training algorithm, initial
results paint an interesting picture in which training costs grow very quickly
indeed. We describe a candidate explanation for the poor scaling, and outline
our intentions to clarify the situation in future work.</span>

                    <span>Large-scale datasets are important for the development of deep learning
models. Such datasets usually require a heavy workload of annotations, which
are extremely time-consuming and expensive. To accelerate the annotation
procedure, multiple annotators may be employed to label different subsets of
the data. However, the inconsistency and bias among different annotators are
harmful to the model training, especially for qualitative and subjective
tasks.To address this challenge, in this paper, we propose a novel contrastive
regression framework to address the disjoint annotations problem, where each
sample is labeled by only one annotator and multiple annotators work on
disjoint subsets of the data. To take account of both the intra-annotator
consistency and inter-annotator inconsistency, two strategies are
employed.Firstly, a contrastive-based loss is applied to learn the relative
ranking among different samples of the same annotator, with the assumption that
the ranking of samples from the same annotator is unanimous. Secondly, we apply
the gradient reversal layer to learn robust representations that are invariant
to different annotators. Experiments on the facial expression prediction task,
as well as the image quality assessment task, verify the effectiveness of our
proposed framework.</span>

                    <span>A long standing problem in the modeling of non-Newtonian hydrodynamics is the
availability of reliable and interpretable hydrodynamic models that faithfully
encode the underlying micro-scale polymer dynamics. The main complication
arises from the long polymer relaxation time, the complex molecular structure,
and heterogeneous interaction. DeePN$^2$, a deep learning-based non-Newtonian
hydrodynamic model, has been proposed and has shown some success in
systematically passing the micro-scale structural mechanics information to the
macro-scale hydrodynamics for suspensions with simple polymer conformation and
bond potential. The model retains a multi-scaled nature by mapping the polymer
configurations into a set of symmetry-preserving macro-scale features. The
extended constitutive laws for these macro-scale features can be directly
learned from the kinetics of their micro-scale counterparts. In this paper, we
carry out further study of DeePN$^2$ using more complex micro-structural
models. We show that DeePN$^2$ can faithfully capture the broadly overlooked
viscoelastic differences arising from the specific molecular structural
mechanics without human intervention.</span>

                    <span>Graph neural network (GNN) has shown convincing performance in learning
powerful node representations that preserve both node attributes and graph
structural information. However, many GNNs encounter problems in effectiveness
and efficiency when they are designed with a deeper network structure or handle
large-sized graphs. Several sampling algorithms have been proposed for
improving and accelerating the training of GNNs, yet they ignore understanding
the source of GNN performance gain. The measurement of information within graph
data can help the sampling algorithms to keep high-value information while
removing redundant information and even noise. In this paper, we propose a
Metric-Guided (MeGuide) subgraph learning framework for GNNs. MeGuide employs
two novel metrics: Feature Smoothness and Connection Failure Distance to guide
the subgraph sampling and mini-batch based training. Feature Smoothness is
designed for analyzing the feature of nodes in order to retain the most
valuable information, while Connection Failure Distance can measure the
structural information to control the size of subgraphs. We demonstrate the
effectiveness and efficiency of MeGuide in training various GNNs on multiple
datasets.</span>

                    <span>One of the reasons that many neural networks are capable of replicating
complicated tasks or functions is their universality property. The past few
decades have seen many attempts in providing constructive proofs for single or
class of neural networks. This paper is an effort to provide a unified and
constructive framework for the universality of a large class of activations
including most of existing activations and beyond. At the heart of the
framework is the concept of neural network approximate identity. It turns out
that most of existing activations are neural network approximate identity, and
thus universal in the space of continuous of functions on compacta. The
framework induces several advantages. First, it is constructive with elementary
means from functional analysis, probability theory, and numerical analysis.
Second, it is the first unified attempt that is valid for most of existing
activations. Third, as a by product, the framework provides the first
university proof for some of the existing activation functions including Mish,
SiLU, ELU, GELU, and etc. Fourth, it discovers new activations with guaranteed
universality property. Indeed, any activation\textemdash whose $\k$th
derivative, with $\k$ being an integer, is integrable and essentially
bounded\textemdash is universal. Fifth, for a given activation and error
tolerance, the framework provides precisely the architecture of the
corresponding one-hidden neural network with predetermined number of neuron,
and the values of weights/biases.</span>

                    <span>For strongly convex objectives that are smooth, the classical theory of
gradient descent ensures linear convergence relative to the number of gradient
evaluations. An analogous nonsmooth theory is challenging: even when the
objective is smooth at every iterate, the corresponding local models are
unstable, and traditional remedies need unpredictably many cutting planes. We
instead propose a multipoint generalization of the gradient descent iteration
for local optimization. While designed with general objectives in mind, we are
motivated by a &quot;max-of-smooth&quot; model that captures subdifferential dimension at
optimality. We prove linear convergence when the objective is itself
max-of-smooth, and experiments suggest a more general phenomenon.</span>

                    <span>Reinforcement learning has recently shown promise in learning quality
solutions in many combinatorial optimization problems. In particular, the
attention-based encoder-decoder models show high effectiveness on various
routing problems, including the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP).
Unfortunately, they perform poorly for the TSP with Drone (TSP-D), requiring
routing a heterogeneous fleet of vehicles in coordination -- a truck and a
drone. In TSP-D, the two vehicles are moving in tandem and may need to wait at
a node for the other vehicle to join. State-less attention-based decoder fails
to make such coordination between vehicles. We propose an attention
encoder-LSTM decoder hybrid model, in which the decoder&#x27;s hidden state can
represent the sequence of actions made. We empirically demonstrate that such a
hybrid model improves upon a purely attention-based model for both solution
quality and computational efficiency. Our experiments on the min-max
Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (mmCVRP) also confirm that the hybrid model
is more suitable for coordinated routing of multiple vehicles than the
attention-based model.</span>

                    <span>Unified understanding of neuro networks (NNs) gets the users into great
trouble because they have been puzzled by what kind of rules should be obeyed
to optimize the internal structure of NNs. Considering the potential capability
of random graphs to alter how computation is performed, we demonstrate that
they can serve as architecture generators to optimize the internal structure of
NNs. To transform the random graph theory into an NN model with practical
meaning and based on clarifying the input-output relationship of each neuron,
we complete data feature mapping by calculating Fourier Random Features (FRFs).
Under the usage of this low-operation cost approach, neurons are assigned to
several groups of which connection relationships can be regarded as uniform
representations of random graphs they belong to, and random arrangement fuses
those neurons to establish the pattern matrix, markedly reducing manual
participation and computational cost without the fixed and deep architecture.
Leveraging this single neuromorphic learning model termed random graph-based
neuro network (RGNN) we develop a joint classification mechanism involving
information interaction between multiple RGNNs and realize significant
performance improvements in supervised learning for three benchmark tasks,
whereby they effectively avoid the adverse impact of the interpretability of
NNs on the structure design and engineering practice.</span>

                    <span>&quot;Benign overfitting&quot;, where classifiers memorize noisy training data yet
still achieve a good generalization performance, has drawn great attention in
the machine learning community. To explain this surprising phenomenon, a series
of works have provided theoretical justification in over-parameterized linear
regression, classification, and kernel methods. However, it is not clear if
benign overfitting still occurs in the presence of adversarial examples, i.e.,
examples with tiny and intentional perturbations to fool the classifiers. In
this paper, we show that benign overfitting indeed occurs in adversarial
training, a principled approach to defend against adversarial examples. In
detail, we prove the risk bounds of the adversarially trained linear classifier
on the mixture of sub-Gaussian data under $\ell_p$ adversarial perturbations.
Our result suggests that under moderate perturbations, adversarially trained
linear classifiers can achieve the near-optimal standard and adversarial risks,
despite overfitting the noisy training data. Numerical experiments validate our
theoretical findings.</span>

technique to improve the generalization of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). Our
method leverages the recent advances in Mixup regularizer for vision and text,
where random sample pairs and their labels are interpolated to create synthetic
samples for training. Unlike images or natural sentences, graphs have arbitrary
structure and topology, and even simply deleting or adding one edge from a
graph can dramatically change its semantic meanings. This makes interpolating
graph inputs very challenging because mixing graph pairs may naturally create
graphs with identical structure but with conflict labels, causing the manifold
intrusion issue. To cope with this obstacle, we propose a simple input mixing
schema for Mixup on graph, coined ifMixup. We theoretically prove that, with a
mild assumption, ifMixup guarantees that the mixed graphs are manifold
intrusion free. We also empirically verify that ifMixup can effectively
regularize the graph classification learning, resulting in superior predictive
accuracy over popular graph augmentation baselines.</span>

                    <span>Realistically -- and equitably -- modeling the dynamics of group-level
disparities in machine learning remains an open problem. In particular, we
desire models that do not suppose inherent differences between artificial
groups of people -- but rather endogenize disparities by appeal to unequal
initial conditions of insular subpopulations. In this paper, agents each have a
real-valued feature $X$ (e.g., credit score) informed by a &quot;true&quot; binary label
$Y$ representing qualification (e.g., for a loan). Each agent alternately (1)
receives a binary classification label $\hat{Y}$ (e.g., loan approval) from a
Bayes-optimal machine learning classifier observing $X$ and (2) may update
their qualification $Y$ by imitating successful strategies (e.g., seek a raise)
within an isolated group $G$ of agents to which they belong. We consider the
disparity of qualification rates $\Pr(Y&#x3D;1)$ between different groups and how
this disparity changes subject to a sequence of Bayes-optimal classifiers
repeatedly retrained on the global population. We model the evolving
qualification rates of each subpopulation (group) using the replicator
equation, which derives from a class of imitation processes. We show that
differences in qualification rates between subpopulations can persist
indefinitely for a set of non-trivial equilibrium states due to uniformed
classifier deployments, even when groups are identical in all aspects except
initial qualification densities. We next simulate the effects of commonly
proposed fairness interventions on this dynamical system along with a new
feedback control mechanism capable of permanently eliminating group-level
qualification rate disparities. We conclude by discussing the limitations of
our model and findings and by outlining potential future work.</span>

                    <span>Identifying anomalies refers to detecting samples that do not resemble the
training data distribution. Many generative models have been used to find
anomalies, and among them, generative adversarial network (GAN)-based
approaches are currently very popular. GANs mainly rely on the rich contextual
information of these models to identify the actual training distribution.
Following this analogy, we suggested a new unsupervised model based on GANs --a
combination of an autoencoder and a GAN. Further, a new scoring function was
introduced to target anomalies where a linear combination of the internal
representation of the discriminator and the generator&#x27;s visual representation,
plus the encoded representation of the autoencoder, come together to define the
proposed anomaly score. The model was further evaluated on benchmark datasets
such as SVHN, CIFAR10, and MNIST, as well as a public medical dataset of
leukemia images. In all the experiments, our model outperformed its existing
counterparts while slightly improving the inference time.</span>

                    <span>We study the model-based reward-free reinforcement learning with linear
function approximation for episodic Markov decision processes (MDPs). In this
setting, the agent works in two phases. In the exploration phase, the agent
interacts with the environment and collects samples without the reward. In the
planning phase, the agent is given a specific reward function and uses samples
collected from the exploration phase to learn a good policy. We propose a new
provably efficient algorithm, called UCRL-RFE under the Linear Mixture MDP
assumption, where the transition probability kernel of the MDP can be
parameterized by a linear function over certain feature mappings defined on the
triplet of state, action, and next state. We show that to obtain an
$\epsilon$-optimal policy for arbitrary reward function, UCRL-RFE needs to
sample at most $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(H^5d^2\epsilon^{-2})$ episodes during the
exploration phase. Here, $H$ is the length of the episode, $d$ is the dimension
of the feature mapping. We also propose a variant of UCRL-RFE using
Bernstein-type bonus and show that it needs to sample at most
$\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(H^4d(H + d)\epsilon^{-2})$ to achieve an
$\epsilon$-optimal policy. By constructing a special class of linear Mixture
MDPs, we also prove that for any reward-free algorithm, it needs to sample at
least $\tilde \Omega(H^2d\epsilon^{-2})$ episodes to obtain an
$\epsilon$-optimal policy. Our upper bound matches the lower bound in terms of
the dependence on $\epsilon$ and the dependence on $d$ if $H \ge d$.</span>

                    <span>Current models on Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) have shown an
evident and quantified lack of reliability for measuring feature-relevance when
statistically entangled features are proposed for training deep classifiers.
There has been an increase in the application of Deep Learning in clinical
trials to predict early diagnosis of neuro-developmental disorders, such as
Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). However, the inclusion of more reliable
saliency-maps to obtain more trustworthy and interpretable metrics using neural
activity features is still insufficiently mature for practical applications in
diagnostics or clinical trials. Moreover, in ASD research the inclusion of deep
classifiers that use neural measures to predict viewed facial emotions is
relatively unexplored. Therefore, in this study we propose the evaluation of a
Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for electroencephalography (EEG)-based
facial emotion recognition decoding complemented with a novel
RemOve-And-Retrain (ROAR) methodology to recover highly relevant features used
in the classifier. Specifically, we compare well-known relevance maps such as
Layer-Wise Relevance Propagation (LRP), PatternNet, Pattern-Attribution, and
Smooth-Grad Squared. This study is the first to consolidate a more transparent
feature-relevance calculation for a successful EEG-based facial emotion
recognition using a within-subject-trained CNN in typically-developed and ASD
individuals.</span>

                    <span>Bayesian optimization has proven to be an efficient method to optimize
expensive-to-evaluate systems. However, depending on the cost of single
observations, multi-dimensional optimizations of one or more objectives may
still be prohibitively expensive. Multi-fidelity optimization remedies this
issue by including multiple, cheaper information sources such as low-resolution
approximations in numerical simulations. Acquisition functions for
multi-fidelity optimization are typically based on exploration-heavy algorithms
that are difficult to combine with optimization towards multiple objectives.

Here we show that the expected hypervolume improvement policy can act in many
situations as a suitable substitute. We incorporate the evaluation cost either
via a two-step evaluation or within a single acquisition function with an
additional fidelity-related objective. This permits simultaneous
multi-objective and multi-fidelity optimization, which allows to accurately
establish the Pareto set and front at fractional cost. Benchmarks show a cost
reduction of an order of magnitude or more. Our method thus allows for Pareto
optimization of extremely expansive black-box functions.

The presented methods are simple and straightforward to implement in
existing, optimized Bayesian optimization frameworks and can immediately be
extended to batch optimization. The techniques can also be used to combine
different continuous and/or discrete fidelity dimensions, which makes them
particularly relevant for simulation problems in plasma physics, fluid dynamics
and many other branches of scientific computing.</span>

                    <span>Scene Graph Generation (SGG) remains a challenging visual understanding task
due to its complex compositional property. Most previous works adopt a
bottom-up two-stage or a point-based one-stage approach, which often suffers
from overhead time complexity or sub-optimal design assumption. In this work,
we propose a novel SGG method to address the aforementioned issues, which
formulates the task as a bipartite graph construction problem. To solve the
problem, we develop a transformer-based end-to-end framework that first
generates the entity and predicate proposal set, followed by inferring directed
edges to form the relation triplets. In particular, we develop a new
entity-aware predicate representation based on a structural predicate generator
to leverage the compositional property of relationships. Moreover, we design a
graph assembling module to infer the connectivity of the bipartite scene graph
based on our entity-aware structure, enabling us to generate the scene graph in
an end-to-end manner. Extensive experimental results show that our design is
able to achieve the state-of-the-art or comparable performance on two
challenging benchmarks, surpassing most of the existing approaches and enjoying
higher efficiency in inference. We hope our model can serve as a strong
baseline for the Transformer-based scene graph generation.</span>

                    <span>Thompson Sampling (TS) is one of the most effective algorithms for solving
contextual multi-armed bandit problems. In this paper, we propose a new
algorithm, called Neural Thompson Sampling, which adapts deep neural networks
for both exploration and exploitation. At the core of our algorithm is a novel
posterior distribution of the reward, where its mean is the neural network
approximator, and its variance is built upon the neural tangent features of the
corresponding neural network. We prove that, provided the underlying reward
function is bounded, the proposed algorithm is guaranteed to achieve a
cumulative regret of $\mathcal{O}(T^{1/2})$, which matches the regret of other
contextual bandit algorithms in terms of total round number $T$. Experimental
comparisons with other benchmark bandit algorithms on various data sets
corroborate our theory.</span>

transform (DWT) and Machine learning classifiers. Here DWT has been used for
feature extraction as it provides a better decomposition of the signals in
different frequency bands. At first, DWT has been applied to the EEG signal to
extract the detail and approximate coefficients or different sub-bands. After
the extraction of the coefficients, principal component analysis (PCA) has been
applied on different sub-bands and then a feature level fusion technique is
used to extract the important features in low dimensional feature space. Three

                    <span>Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have achieved remarkable success in
automatically segmenting organs or lesions on 3D medical images. Recently,

classification tasks. Compared with CNNs, transformer networks have an
appealing advantage of extracting long-range features due to their

                    <span>Deep Reinforcement Learning (RL) is a powerful framework for solving complex
real-world problems. Large neural networks employed in the framework are
traditionally associated with better generalization capabilities, but their
increased size entails the drawbacks of extensive training duration,
substantial hardware resources, and longer inference times. One way to tackle
this problem is to prune neural networks leaving only the necessary parameters.
State-of-the-art concurrent pruning techniques for imposing sparsity perform
demonstrably well in applications where data distributions are fixed. However,
they have not yet been substantially explored in the context of RL. We close
the gap between RL and single-shot pruning techniques and present a general
pruning approach to the Offline RL. We leverage a fixed dataset to prune neural
networks before the start of RL training. We then run experiments varying the
network sparsity level and evaluating the validity of pruning at initialization
techniques in continuous control tasks. Our results show that with 95% of the
network weights pruned, Offline-RL algorithms can still retain performance in
the majority of our experiments. To the best of our knowledge, no prior work
utilizing pruning in RL retained performance at such high levels of sparsity.

Moreover, pruning at initialization techniques can be easily integrated into
any existing Offline-RL algorithms without changing the learning objective.</span>

                    <span>Sampling from an unnormalized probability distribution is a fundamental
problem in machine learning with applications including Bayesian modeling,
latent factor inference, and energy-based model training. After decades of
research, variations of MCMC remain the default approach to sampling despite
slow convergence. Auxiliary neural models can learn to speed up MCMC, but the
overhead for training the extra model can be prohibitive. We propose a
fundamentally different approach to this problem via a new Hamiltonian dynamics
with a non-Newtonian momentum. In contrast to MCMC approaches like Hamiltonian
Monte Carlo, no stochastic step is required. Instead, the proposed
deterministic dynamics in an extended state space exactly sample the target
distribution, specified by an energy function, under an assumption of
ergodicity. Alternatively, the dynamics can be interpreted as a normalizing
flow that samples a specified energy model without training. The proposed
Energy Sampling Hamiltonian (ESH) dynamics have a simple form that can be
solved with existing ODE solvers, but we derive a specialized solver that
exhibits much better performance. ESH dynamics converge faster than their MCMC
competitors enabling faster, more stable training of neural network energy
models.</span>

anchors to enforce different views of a given image to be assigned to the same

clustering, CARL proposes to learn the set of general prototypes in an online

reason is that traffic can break down drastically during the early morning

day to day. Early morning traffic forecast is crucial to inform morning-commute
traffic management, but they are generally challenging to predict in advance,
particularly by midnight. In this paper, we propose to mine Twitter messages as
a probing method to understand the impacts of people&#x27;s work and rest patterns
in the evening/midnight of the previous day to the next-day morning traffic.
The model is tested on freeway networks in Pittsburgh as experiments. The
resulting relationship is surprisingly simple and powerful. We find that, in
general, the earlier people rest as indicated from Tweets, the more congested
roads will be in the next morning. The occurrence of big events in the evening
before, represented by higher or lower tweet sentiment than normal, often
implies lower travel demand in the next morning than normal days. Besides,
people&#x27;s tweeting activities in the night before and early morning are
statistically associated with congestion in morning peak hours. We make use of
such relationships to build a predictive framework which forecasts morning
commute congestion using people&#x27;s tweeting profiles extracted by 5 am or as
late as the midnight prior to the morning. The Pittsburgh study supports that
our framework can precisely predict morning congestion, particularly for some
road segments upstream of roadway bottlenecks with large day-to-day congestion
variation. Our approach considerably outperforms those existing methods without
Twitter message features, and it can learn meaningful representation of demand
from tweeting profiles that offer managerial insights.</span>

                    <span>In this paper we introduce a new problem within the growing literature of
interpretability for convolution neural networks (CNNs). While previous work
has focused on the question of how to visually interpret CNNs, we ask what it
is that we care to interpret, that is, which layers and neurons are worth our
attention? Due to the vast size of modern deep learning network architectures,
automated, quantitative methods are needed to rank the relative importance of
neurons so as to provide an answer to this question. We present a new
statistical method for ranking the hidden neurons in any convolutional layer of
a network. We define importance as the maximal correlation between the
activation maps and the class score. We provide different ways in which this
method can be used for visualization purposes with MNIST and ImageNet, and show
a real-world application of our method to air pollution prediction with
street-level images.</span>

                    <span>Globally, there is a substantial unmet need to diagnose various diseases
effectively. The complexity of the different disease mechanisms and underlying
symptoms of the patient population presents massive challenges to developing
the early diagnosis tool and effective treatment. Machine Learning (ML), an
area of Artificial Intelligence (AI), enables researchers, physicians, and
patients to solve some of these issues. Based on relevant research, this review
explains how Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) are being used to
help in the early identification of numerous diseases. To begin, a bibliometric
study of the publication is given using data from the Scopus and Web of Science
(WOS) databases. The bibliometric study of 1216 publications was undertaken to
determine the most prolific authors, nations, organizations, and most cited
articles. The review then summarizes the most recent trends and approaches in
Machine Learning-based Disease Diagnosis (MLBDD), considering the following
factors: algorithm, disease types, data type, application, and evaluation
metrics. Finally, the paper highlights key results and provides insight into
future trends and opportunities in the MLBDD area.</span>

                    <span>We introduce BERTphone, a Transformer encoder trained on large speech corpora
that outputs phonetically-aware contextual representation vectors that can be
used for both speaker and language recognition. This is accomplished by
training on two objectives: the first, inspired by adapting BERT to the
continuous domain, involves masking spans of input frames and reconstructing
the whole sequence for acoustic representation learning; the second, inspired
by the success of bottleneck features from ASR, is a sequence-level CTC loss
applied to phoneme labels for phonetic representation learning. We pretrain two
BERTphone models (one on Fisher and one on TED-LIUM) and use them as feature
extractors into x-vector-style DNNs for both tasks. We attain a
state-of-the-art $C_{\text{avg}}$ of 6.16 on the challenging LRE07 3sec
closed-set language recognition task. On Fisher and VoxCeleb speaker
recognition tasks, we see an 18% relative reduction in speaker EER when
training on BERTphone vectors instead of MFCCs. In general, BERTphone
outperforms previous phonetic pretraining approaches on the same data. We

                    <span>Tree-based algorithms such as random forests and gradient boosted trees
continue to be among the most popular and powerful machine learning models used
across multiple disciplines. The conventional wisdom of estimating the impact
of a feature in tree based models is to measure the \textit{node-wise reduction
of a loss function}, which (i) yields only global importance measures and (ii)
is known to suffer from severe biases. Conditional feature contributions (CFCs)
provide \textit{local}, case-by-case explanations of a prediction by following
the decision path and attributing changes in the expected output of the model
to each feature along the path. However, Lundberg et al. pointed out a
potential bias of CFCs which depends on the distance from the root of a tree.
The by now immensely popular alternative, SHapley Additive exPlanation (SHAP)
values appear to mitigate this bias but are computationally much more
expensive. Here we contribute a thorough comparison of the explanations
computed by both methods on a set of 164 publicly available classification
problems in order to provide data-driven algorithm recommendations to current
researchers. For random forests, we find extremely high similarities and
correlations of both local and global SHAP values and CFC scores, leading to
very similar rankings and interpretations. Analogous conclusions hold for the
fidelity of using global feature importance scores as a proxy for the
predictive power associated with each feature.</span>

                    <span>Alternating gradient-descent-ascent (AltGDA) is an optimization algorithm
that has been widely used for model training in various machine learning
applications, which aim to solve a nonconvex minimax optimization problem.
However, the existing studies show that it suffers from a high computation
complexity in nonconvex minimax optimization. In this paper, we develop a
single-loop and fast AltGDA-type algorithm that leverages proximal gradient
updates and momentum acceleration to solve regularized nonconvex minimax
optimization problems. By identifying the intrinsic Lyapunov function of this
algorithm, we prove that it converges to a critical point of the nonconvex
minimax optimization problem and achieves a computation complexity
$\mathcal{O}(\kappa^{1.5}\epsilon^{-2})$, where $\epsilon$ is the desired level
of accuracy and $\kappa$ is the problem&#x27;s condition number. Such a computation
complexity improves the state-of-the-art complexities of single-loop GDA and
AltGDA algorithms (see the summary of comparison in Table 1). We demonstrate
the effectiveness of our algorithm via an experiment on adversarial deep
learning.</span>

                    <span>Learning continually and online from a continuous stream of data is
challenging, especially for a reinforcement learning agent with sequential
data. When the environment only provides observations giving partial
information about the state of the environment, the agent must learn the agent
state based on the data stream of experience. We refer to the state learned
directly from the data stream of experience as the agent state. Recurrent
neural networks can learn the agent state, but the training methods are
computationally expensive and sensitive to the hyper-parameters, making them
unideal for online learning. This work introduces methods based on the
generate-and-test approach to learn the agent state. A generate-and-test
algorithm searches for state features by generating features and testing their
usefulness. In this process, features useful for the agent&#x27;s performance on the
task are preserved, and the least useful features get replaced with newly
generated features. We study the effectiveness of our methods on two online
multi-step prediction problems. The first problem, trace conditioning, focuses
on the agent&#x27;s ability to remember a cue for a prediction multiple steps into
the future. In the second problem, trace patterning, the agent needs to learn
patterns in the observation signals and remember them for future predictions.
We show that our proposed methods can effectively learn the agent state online
and produce accurate predictions.</span>

                    <span>Improvements in computational and experimental capabilities are rapidly
increasing the amount of scientific data that is routinely generated. In
applications that are constrained by memory and computational intensity,
excessively large datasets may hinder scientific discovery, making data
reduction a critical component of data-driven methods. Datasets are growing in
two directions: the number of data points and their dimensionality. Whereas
data compression techniques are concerned with reducing dimensionality, the
focus here is on reducing the number of data points. A strategy is proposed to
select data points such that they uniformly span the phase-space of the data.
The algorithm proposed relies on estimating the probability map of the data and
using it to construct an acceptance probability. An iterative method is used to
accurately estimate the probability of the rare data points when only a small
subset of the dataset is used to construct the probability map. Instead of
binning the phase-space to estimate the probability map, its functional form is
approximated with a normalizing flow. Therefore, the method naturally extends
to high-dimensional datasets. The proposed framework is demonstrated as a
viable pathway to enable data-efficient machine learning when abundant data is
available. An implementation of the method is available in a companion
repository (https://github.com/NREL/Phase-space-sampling).</span>

                    <span>Triangular flows, also known as Kn\&quot;{o}the-Rosenblatt measure couplings,
comprise an important building block of normalizing flow models for generative
modeling and density estimation, including popular autoregressive flow models
such as real-valued non-volume preserving transformation models (Real NVP). We
present statistical guarantees and sample complexity bounds for triangular flow
statistical models. In particular, we establish the statistical consistency and
the finite sample convergence rates of the Kullback-Leibler estimator of the
Kn\&quot;{o}the-Rosenblatt measure coupling using tools from empirical process
theory. Our results highlight the anisotropic geometry of function classes at
play in triangular flows, shed light on optimal coordinate ordering, and lead
to statistical guarantees for Jacobian flows. We conduct numerical experiments

findings.</span>

couple of critical observations which we believe are of general interest for
any future work on WILDS. Our study focuses on two datasets: iWildCam and FMoW.
We show that (1) Conducting separate cross-validation for each evaluation
metric is crucial for both datasets, (2) A weak correlation between validation
and test performance might make model development difficult for iWildCam, (3)
Minor changes in the training of hyper-parameters improve the baseline by a
relatively large margin (mainly on FMoW), (4) There is a strong correlation
between certain domains and certain target labels (mainly on iWildCam). To the
best of our knowledge, no prior work on these datasets has reported these
observations despite their obvious importance. Our code is public.</span>

                    <span>Kidney DCE-MRI aims at both qualitative assessment of kidney anatomy and
quantitative assessment of kidney function by estimating the tracer kinetic
(TK) model parameters. Accurate estimation of TK model parameters requires an
accurate measurement of the arterial input function (AIF) with high temporal
resolution. Accelerated imaging is used to achieve high temporal resolution,
which yields under-sampling artifacts in the reconstructed images. Compressed
sensing (CS) methods offer a variety of reconstruction options. Most commonly,
sparsity of temporal differences is encouraged for regularization to reduce
artifacts. Increasing regularization in CS methods removes the ambient
artifacts but also over-smooths the signal temporally which reduces the
parameter estimation accuracy. In this work, we propose a single image trained
deep neural network to reduce MRI under-sampling artifacts without reducing the
accuracy of functional imaging markers. Instead of regularizing with a penalty
term in optimization, we promote regularization by generating images from a
lower dimensional representation. In this manuscript we motivate and explain
the lower dimensional input design. We compare our approach to CS
reconstructions with multiple regularization weights. Proposed approach results
in kidney biomarkers that are highly correlated with the ground truth markers
estimated using the CS reconstruction which was optimized for functional
analysis. At the same time, the proposed approach reduces the artifacts in the
reconstructed images.</span>

contribution is substantially more efficient than k-means as it does not
require an all to all comparison of data points and clusters. We show that the
optimal solutions of our approximation are the same as in the exact solution.
However, our approach is considerably more efficient at extracting these
clusters compared to the state-of-the-art. We compare our approximation with
the exact k-means and alternative approximation approaches on a series of
standardised clustering tasks. For the evaluation, we consider the algorithmic
complexity, including number of operations to convergence, and the stability of

                    <span>We propose a novel and effective purification based adversarial defense
method against pre-processor blind white- and black-box attacks. Our method is
computationally efficient and trained only with self-supervised learning on
general images, without requiring any adversarial training or retraining of the
classification model. We first show an empirical analysis on the adversarial
noise, defined to be the residual between an original image and its adversarial
example, has almost zero mean, symmetric distribution. Based on this
observation, we propose a very simple iterative Gaussian Smoothing (GS) which
can effectively smooth out adversarial noise and achieve substantially high
robust accuracy. To further improve it, we propose Neural Contextual Iterative
Smoothing (NCIS), which trains a blind-spot network (BSN) in a self-supervised
manner to reconstruct the discriminative features of the original image that is
also smoothed out by GS. From our extensive experiments on the large-scale
ImageNet using four classification models, we show that our method achieves
both competitive standard accuracy and state-of-the-art robust accuracy against
most strong purifier-blind white- and black-box attacks. Also, we propose a new
benchmark for evaluating a purification method based on commercial image
classification APIs, such as AWS, Azure, Clarifai and Google. We generate
adversarial examples by ensemble transfer-based black-box attack, which can
induce complete misclassification of APIs, and demonstrate that our method can
be used to increase adversarial robustness of APIs.</span>

                    <span>We present an objective function for similarity based hierarchical clustering
of partially ordered data that preserves the partial order. That is, if $x \le
y$, and if $[x]$ and $[y]$ are the respective clusters of $x$ and $y$, then
there is an order relation $\le&#x27;$ on the clusters for which $[x] \le&#x27; |y]$. The
theory distinguishes itself from existing theories for clustering of ordered
data in that the order relation and the similarity are combined into a
bi-objective optimisation problem to obtain a hierarchical clustering seeking
to satisfy both. In particular, the order relation is weighted in the range
$[0,1]$, and if the similarity and the order relation are not aligned, then
order preservation may have to yield in favor of clustering. Finding an optimal
solution is NP-hard, so we provide a polynomial time approximation algorithm,
with a relative performance guarantee of $O\!\left(\log^{3/2} \!\!\, n
\right)$, based on successive applications of directed sparsest cut. We provide
a demonstration on a benchmark dataset, showing that our method outperforms
existing methods for order preserving hierarchical clustering with significant
margin. The theory is an extension of the Dasgupta cost function for divisive
hierarchical clustering.</span>

                    <span>A recent line of research on deep learning focuses on the extremely
over-parameterized setting, and shows that when the network width is larger
than a high degree polynomial of the training sample size $n$ and the inverse
of the target error $\epsilon^{-1}$, deep neural networks learned by
(stochastic) gradient descent enjoy nice optimization and generalization
guarantees. Very recently, it is shown that under certain margin assumptions on
the training data, a polylogarithmic width condition suffices for two-layer
ReLU networks to converge and generalize (Ji and Telgarsky, 2019). However,
whether deep neural networks can be learned with such a mild
over-parameterization is still an open question. In this work, we answer this
question affirmatively and establish sharper learning guarantees for deep ReLU
networks trained by (stochastic) gradient descent. In specific, under certain
assumptions made in previous work, our optimization and generalization
guarantees hold with network width polylogarithmic in $n$ and $\epsilon^{-1}$.
Our results push the study of over-parameterized deep neural networks towards
more practical settings.</span>

                    <span>Hierarchical forecasting with intermittent time series is a challenge in both
research and empirical studies. Extensive research focuses on improving the
accuracy of each hierarchy, especially the intermittent time series at bottom
levels. Then hierarchical reconciliation could be used to improve the overall
performance further. In this paper, we present a
\emph{hierarchical-forecasting-with-alignment} approach that treats the bottom
level forecasts as mutable to ensure higher forecasting accuracy on the upper
levels of the hierarchy. We employ a pure deep learning forecasting approach
N-BEATS for continuous time series at the top levels and a widely used
tree-based algorithm LightGBM for the intermittent time series at the bottom
level. The \emph{hierarchical-forecasting-with-alignment} approach is a simple
yet effective variant of the bottom-up method, accounting for biases that are
difficult to observe at the bottom level. It allows suboptimal forecasts at the
lower level to retain a higher overall performance. The approach in this
empirical study was developed by the first author during the M5 Forecasting
Accuracy competition, ranking second place. The method is also business
orientated and could benefit for business strategic planning.</span>

                    <span>This paper analyzes a two-timescale stochastic algorithm framework for
bilevel optimization. Bilevel optimization is a class of problems which exhibit
a two-level structure, and its goal is to minimize an outer objective function
with variables which are constrained to be the optimal solution to an (inner)
optimization problem. We consider the case when the inner problem is
unconstrained and strongly convex, while the outer problem is constrained and
has a smooth objective function. We propose a two-timescale stochastic
approximation (TTSA) algorithm for tackling such a bilevel problem. In the
algorithm, a stochastic gradient update with a larger step size is used for the
inner problem, while a projected stochastic gradient update with a smaller step
size is used for the outer problem. We analyze the convergence rates for the
TTSA algorithm under various settings: when the outer problem is strongly
convex (resp.~weakly convex), the TTSA algorithm finds an
$\mathcal{O}(K^{-2/3})$-optimal (resp.~$\mathcal{O}(K^{-2/5})$-stationary)
solution, where $K$ is the total iteration number. As an application, we show
that a two-timescale natural actor-critic proximal policy optimization
algorithm can be viewed as a special case of our TTSA framework. Importantly,
the natural actor-critic algorithm is shown to converge at a rate of
$\mathcal{O}(K^{-1/4})$ in terms of the gap in expected discounted reward
compared to a global optimal policy.</span>

                    <span>Adversarial training is so far the most effective strategy in defending
against adversarial examples. However, it suffers from high computational costs
due to the iterative adversarial attacks in each training step. Recent studies
show that it is possible to achieve fast Adversarial Training by performing a
single-step attack with random initialization. However, such an approach still
lags behind state-of-the-art adversarial training algorithms on both stability
and model robustness. In this work, we develop a new understanding towards Fast
Adversarial Training, by viewing random initialization as performing randomized
smoothing for better optimization of the inner maximization problem. Following
this new perspective, we also propose a new initialization strategy, backward
smoothing, to further improve the stability and model robustness over
single-step robust training methods. Experiments on multiple benchmarks
demonstrate that our method achieves similar model robustness as the original
TRADES method while using much less training time ($\sim$3x improvement with
the same training schedule).</span>

                    <span>Pre-trained language models have been successful on text classification
tasks, but are prone to learning spurious correlations from biased datasets,
and are thus vulnerable when making inferences in a new domain. Prior work
reveals such spurious patterns via post-hoc explanation algorithms which
compute the importance of input features. Further, the model is regularized to
align the importance scores with human knowledge, so that the unintended model
behaviors are eliminated. However, such a regularization technique lacks
flexibility and coverage, since only importance scores towards a pre-defined
list of features are adjusted, while more complex human knowledge such as
feature interaction and pattern generalization can hardly be incorporated. In
this work, we propose to refine a learned language model for a target domain by
collecting human-provided compositional explanations regarding observed biases.
By parsing these explanations into executable logic rules, the human-specified
refinement advice from a small set of explanations can be generalized to more
training examples. We additionally introduce a regularization term allowing
adjustments for both importance and interaction of features to better rectify
model behavior. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach on
two text classification tasks by showing improved performance in target domain
as well as improved model fairness after refinement.</span>

                    <span>Deep neural networks (DNNs) are powerful tools for compressing and distilling
information. Due to their scale and complexity, often involving billions of
inter-dependent internal degrees of freedom, exact analysis approaches often
fall short. A common strategy in such cases is to identify slow degrees of
freedom that average out the erratic behavior of the underlying fast
microscopic variables. Here, we identify such a separation of scales occurring
in over-parameterized deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) at the end of
training. It implies that neuron pre-activations fluctuate in a nearly Gaussian
manner with a deterministic latent kernel. While for CNNs with infinitely many
channels these kernels are inert, for finite CNNs they adapt and learn from
data in an analytically tractable manner. The resulting thermodynamic theory of
deep learning yields accurate predictions on several deep non-linear CNN toy
models. In addition, it provides new ways of analyzing and understanding CNNs.</span>

domain discriminative feature module to encourage the domain invariant feature
module to learn more domain invariant features. The proposed architecture can
be applied to any model that utilizes domain invariant features for
unsupervised domain adaptation to improve its ability to extract domain
invariant features. We conduct experiments with the Domain-Adversarial Training
of Neural Networks (DANN) model as a representative algorithm. In the training
process, we supply the same input to the two modules and then extract their
feature distribution and prediction results respectively. We propose a
discrepancy loss to find the discrepancy of the prediction results and the
feature distribution between the two modules. Through the adversarial training
by maximizing the loss of their feature distribution and minimizing the
discrepancy of their prediction results, the two modules are encouraged to
learn more domain discriminative and domain invariant features respectively.
Extensive comparative evaluations are conducted and the proposed approach
outperforms the state-of-the-art in most unsupervised domain adaptation tasks.</span>

of their underlying mechanisms continues to be an obstacle in adoption. To
instill confidence and trust in artificial intelligence systems, Explainable
Artificial Intelligence has emerged as a response to improving modern machine
learning algorithms&#x27; explainability. Inductive Logic Programming (ILP), a
subfield of symbolic artificial intelligence, plays a promising role in
generating interpretable explanations because of its intuitive logic-driven
framework. ILP effectively leverages abductive reasoning to generate
explainable first-order clausal theories from examples and background
knowledge. However, several challenges in developing methods inspired by ILP
need to be addressed for their successful application in practice. For example,
existing ILP systems often have a vast solution space, and the induced
solutions are very sensitive to noises and disturbances. This survey paper
summarizes the recent advances in ILP and a discussion of statistical
relational learning and neural-symbolic algorithms, which offer synergistic
views to ILP. Following a critical review of the recent advances, we delineate
observed challenges and highlight potential avenues of further ILP-motivated
research toward developing self-explanatory artificial intelligence systems.</span>

                    <span>Before researchers rush to reason across all available data or try complex
methods, perhaps it is prudent to first check for simpler alternatives.
Specifically, if the historical data has the most information in some small
region, then perhaps a model learned from that region would suffice for the
rest of the project.

To support this claim, we offer a case study with 240 GitHub projects, where
we find that the information in those projects &quot;clumped&quot; towards the earliest
parts of the project. A defect prediction model learned from just the first 150
commits works as well, or better than state-of-the-art alternatives. Using just
this early life cycle data, we can build models very quickly, very early in the
software project life cycle. Moreover, using this method, we have shown that a
simple model (with just two features) generalizes to hundreds of software
projects.

Based on this experience, we doubt that prior work on generalizing software
engineering defect prediction models may have needlessly complicated an
inherently simple process. Further, prior work that focused on later-life cycle
data needs to be revisited since their conclusions were drawn from relatively
uninformative regions.

                    <span>Extrapolating beyond-demonstrator (BD) performance through the imitation
learning (IL) algorithm aims to learn from and outperform the demonstrator.
Most existing BDIL algorithms are performed in two stages by first inferring a
reward function before learning a policy via reinforcement learning (RL).
However, such two-stage BDIL algorithms suffer from high computational
complexity, weak robustness, and large performance variations. In particular, a
poor reward function derived in the first stage will inevitably incur severe
performance loss in the second stage. In this work, we propose a hybrid
adversarial imitation learning (HAIL) algorithm that is one-stage, model-free,
generative-adversarial (GA) fashion and curiosity-driven. Thanks to the
one-stage design, the HAIL can integrate both the reward function learning and
the policy optimization into one procedure, which leads to many advantages such
as low computational complexity, high robustness, and strong adaptability. More
specifically, HAIL simultaneously imitates the demonstrator and explores BD
performance by utilizing hybrid rewards. Extensive simulation results confirm
that HAIL can achieve higher performance as compared to other similar BDIL
algorithms.</span>

                    <span>Multinomial Logit (MNL) is one of the most popular discrete choice models and
has been widely used to model ranking data. However, there is a long-standing
technical challenge of learning MNL from many real-world ranking data: exact
calculation of the MNL likelihood of \emph{partial rankings} is generally
intractable. In this work, we develop a scalable method for approximating the
MNL likelihood of general partial rankings in polynomial time complexity. We
also extend the proposed method to learn mixture of MNL. We demonstrate that
the proposed methods are particularly helpful for applications to choice-based
network formation modeling, where the formation of new edges in a network is
viewed as individuals making choices of their friends over a candidate set. The
problem of learning mixture of MNL models from partial rankings naturally
arises in such applications. And the proposed methods can be used to learn MNL
models from network data without the strong assumption that temporal orders of
all the edge formation are available. We conduct experiments on both synthetic
and real-world network data to demonstrate that the proposed methods achieve
more accurate parameter estimation and better fitness of data compared to
conventional methods.</span>

enhance robustness to clients failures in DFL with theoretical guarantees.
Also, we present an efficient algorithm to convert a given graph to a practical

                    <span>A time series represents a set of observations collected over time.
Typically, these observations are captured with a uniform sampling frequency
(e.g. daily). When data points are observed in uneven time intervals the time
series is referred to as irregular or intermittent. In such scenarios, the most
common solution is to reconstruct the time series to make it regular, thus
removing its intermittency. We hypothesise that, in irregular time series, the
time at which each observation is collected may be helpful to summarise the
dynamics of the data and improve forecasting performance. We study this idea by
developing a novel automatic feature engineering framework, which focuses on
extracting information from this point of view, i.e., when each instance is
collected. We study how valuable this information is by integrating it in a
time series forecasting workflow and investigate how it compares to or
complements state-of-the-art methods for regular time series forecasting. In
the end, we contribute by providing a novel framework that tackles feature
engineering for time series from an angle previously vastly ignored. We show
that our approach has the potential to further extract more information about
time series that significantly improves forecasting performance.</span>

                    <span>Predicting human motion from historical pose sequence is crucial for a
machine to succeed in intelligent interactions with humans. One aspect that has
been obviated so far, is the fact that how we represent the skeletal pose has a
critical impact on the prediction results. Yet there is no effort that
investigates across different pose representation schemes. We conduct an
indepth study on various pose representations with a focus on their effects on
the motion prediction task. Moreover, recent approaches build upon
off-the-shelf RNN units for motion prediction. These approaches process input
pose sequence sequentially and inherently have difficulties in capturing
long-term dependencies. In this paper, we propose a novel RNN architecture
termed AHMR (Attentive Hierarchical Motion Recurrent network) for motion
prediction which simultaneously models local motion contexts and a global
context. We further explore a geodesic loss and a forward kinematics loss for
the motion prediction task, which have more geometric significance than the
widely employed L2 loss. Interestingly, we applied our method to a range of
articulate objects including human, fish, and mouse. Empirical results show
that our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in short-term
prediction and achieves much enhanced long-term prediction proficiency, such as
retaining natural human-like motions over 50 seconds predictions. Our codes are

                    <span>To approach different business objectives, online traffic shaping algorithms
aim at improving exposures of a target set of items, such as boosting the
growth of new commodities. Generally, these algorithms assume that the utility
of each user-item pair can be accessed via a well-trained conversion rate
prediction model. However, for real E-Commerce platforms, there are unavoidable
factors preventing us from learning such an accurate model. In order to break
the heavy dependence on accurate inputs of the utility, we propose a general
online traffic shaping protocol for online E-Commerce applications. In our
framework, we approximate the function mapping the bonus scores, which
generally are the only method to influence the ranking result in the traffic
shaping problem, to the numbers of exposures and purchases. Concretely, we
approximate the above function by a class of the piece-wise linear function
constructed on the convex hull of the explored data points. Moreover, we
reformulate the online traffic shaping problem as linear programming where
these piece-wise linear functions are embedded into both the objective and
constraints. Our algorithm can straightforwardly optimize the linear
programming in the prime space, and its solution can be simply applied by a
stochastic strategy to fulfill the optimized objective and the constraints in
expectation. Finally, the online A/B test shows our proposed algorithm steadily
outperforms the previous industrial level traffic shaping algorithm.</span>

                    <span>Objective: The paper focuses on development of robust and accurate processing
solutions for continuous and cuff-less blood pressure (BP) monitoring. In this
regard, a robust deep learning-based framework is proposed for computation of
low latency, continuous, and calibration-free upper and lower bounds on the
systolic and diastolic BP. Method: Referred to as the BP-Net, the proposed
framework is a novel convolutional architecture that provides longer effective
memory while achieving superior performance due to incorporation of casual
dialated convolutions and residual connections. To utilize the real potential
of deep learning in extraction of intrinsic features (deep features) and
enhance the long-term robustness, the BP-Net uses raw Electrocardiograph (ECG)
and Photoplethysmograph (PPG) signals without extraction of any form of
hand-crafted features as it is common in existing solutions. Results: By
capitalizing on the fact that datasets used in recent literature are not
unified and properly defined, a benchmark dataset is constructed from the
MIMIC-I and MIMIC-III databases obtained from PhysioNet. The proposed BP-Net is
evaluated based on this benchmark dataset demonstrating promising performance
and shows superior generalizable capacity. Conclusion: The proposed BP-Net
architecture is more accurate than canonical recurrent networks and enhances
the long-term robustness of the BP estimation task. Significance: The proposed
BP-Net architecture addresses key drawbacks of existing BP estimation
solutions, i.e., relying heavily on extraction of hand-crafted features, such
as pulse arrival time (PAT), and; Lack of robustness. Finally, the constructed
BP-Net dataset provides a unified base for evaluation and comparison of deep
learning-based BP estimation algorithms.</span>

                    <span>Recently, hyperspectral imaging (HSI) has attracted increasing research
attention, especially for the ones based on a coded aperture snapshot spectral
imaging (CASSI) system. Existing deep HSI reconstruction models are generally
trained on paired data to retrieve original signals upon 2D compressed
measurements given by a particular optical hardware mask in CASSI, during which
the mask largely impacts the reconstruction performance and could work as a
&quot;model hyperparameter&quot; governing on data augmentations. This mask-specific
training style will lead to a hardware miscalibration issue, which sets up
barriers to deploying deep HSI models among different hardware and noisy
environments. To address this challenge, we introduce mask uncertainty for HSI
with a complete variational Bayesian learning treatment and explicitly model it
through a mask decomposition inspired by real hardware. Specifically, we
propose a novel Graph-based Self-Tuning (GST) network to reason uncertainties
adapting to varying spatial structures of masks among different hardware.
Moreover, we develop a bilevel optimization framework to balance HSI
reconstruction and uncertainty estimation, accounting for the hyperparameter
property of masks. Extensive experimental results and model discussions
validate the effectiveness (over 33/30 dB) of the proposed GST method under two
miscalibration scenarios and demonstrate a highly competitive performance
compared with the state-of-the-art well-calibrated methods. Our code and
pre-trained model are available at https://github.com/Jiamian

                    <span>Distributed Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) algorithms has
attracted a surge of interest lately mainly due to the recent advancements of
Deep Neural Networks (DNNs). Conventional Model-Based (MB) or Model-Free (MF)
RL algorithms are not directly applicable to the MARL problems due to
utilization of a fixed reward model for learning the underlying value function.
While DNN-based solutions perform utterly well when a single agent is involved,
such methods fail to fully generalize to the complexities of MARL problems. In
other words, although recently developed approaches based on DNNs for
multi-agent environments have achieved superior performance, they are still
prone to overfiting, high sensitivity to parameter selection, and sample
inefficiency. The paper proposes the Multi-Agent Adaptive Kalman Temporal
Difference (MAK-TD) framework and its Successor Representation-based variant,
referred to as the MAK-SR. Intuitively speaking, the main objective is to
capitalize on unique characteristics of Kalman Filtering (KF) such as
uncertainty modeling and online second order learning. The proposed MAK-TD/SR
frameworks consider the continuous nature of the action-space that is
associated with high dimensional multi-agent environments and exploit Kalman
Temporal Difference (KTD) to address the parameter uncertainty. By leveraging
the KTD framework, SR learning procedure is modeled into a filtering problem,
where Radial Basis Function (RBF) estimators are used to encode the continuous
space into feature vectors. On the other hand, for learning localized reward
functions, we resort to Multiple Model Adaptive Estimation (MMAE), to deal with
the lack of prior knowledge on the observation noise covariance and observation
mapping function. The proposed MAK-TD/SR frameworks are evaluated via several
experiments, which are implemented through the OpenAI Gym MARL benchmarks.</span>

                    <span>In dynamic programming (DP) and reinforcement learning (RL), an agent learns
to act optimally in terms of expected long-term return by sequentially
interacting with its environment modeled by a Markov decision process (MDP).
More generally in distributional reinforcement learning (DRL), the focus is on
the whole distribution of the return, not just its expectation. Although
DRL-based methods produced state-of-the-art performance in RL with function
approximation, they involve additional quantities (compared to the
non-distributional setting) that are still not well understood. As a first
contribution, we introduce a new class of distributional operators, together
with a practical DP algorithm for policy evaluation, that come with a robust
MDP interpretation. Indeed, our approach reformulates through an augmented
state space where each state is split into a worst-case substate and a
best-case substate, whose values are maximized by safe and risky policies
respectively. Finally, we derive distributional operators and DP algorithms
solving a new control task: How to distinguish safe from risky optimal actions
in order to break ties in the space of optimal policies?</span>

introduce the Self Reward Design (SRD), inspired by the Inverse Reward Design,
so that our interpretable design can (1) solve the problem by pure design

agents, each possessing a local cost function, collaboratively minimize the
average of the local cost functions over a connected network. To solve the
problem, we propose a distributed random reshuffling (D-RR) algorithm that
combines the classical distributed gradient descent (DGD) method and Random
Reshuffling (RR). We show that D-RR inherits the superiority of RR for both
smooth strongly convex and smooth nonconvex objective functions. In particular,
for smooth strongly convex objective functions, D-RR achieves
$\mathcal{O}(1/T^2)$ rate of convergence (here, $T$ counts the total number of
iterations) in terms of the squared distance between the iterate and the unique
minimizer. When the objective function is assumed to be smooth nonconvex and
has Lipschitz continuous component functions, we show that D-RR drives the
squared norm of gradient to $0$ at a rate of $\mathcal{O}(1/T^{2/3})$. These
convergence results match those of centralized RR (up to constant factors).</span>

                    <span>Web-based interactions can be frequently represented by an attributed graph,
and node clustering in such graphs has received much attention lately. Multiple
efforts have successfully applied Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN), though
with some limits on accuracy as GCNs have been shown to suffer from
over-smoothing issues. Though other methods (particularly those based on
Laplacian Smoothing) have reported better accuracy, a fundamental limitation of
all the work is a lack of scalability. This paper addresses this open problem
by relating the Laplacian smoothing to the Generalized PageRank and applying a
random-walk based algorithm as a scalable graph filter. This forms the basis
for our scalable deep clustering algorithm, RwSL, where through a
self-supervised mini-batch training mechanism, we simultaneously optimize a
deep neural network for sample-cluster assignment distribution and an
autoencoder for a clustering-oriented embedding. Using 6 real-world datasets
and 6 clustering metrics, we show that RwSL achieved improved results over
several recent baselines. Most notably, we show that RwSL, unlike all other
deep clustering frameworks, can continue to scale beyond graphs with more than
one million nodes, i.e., handle web-scale. We also demonstrate how RwSL could
perform node clustering on a graph with 1.8 billion edges using only a single
GPU.</span>

                    <span>Hyperdimensional Computing (HDC), also known as Vector-Symbolic Architectures
(VSA), is a promising framework for the development of cognitive architectures
and artificial intelligence systems, as well as for technical applications and
emerging neuromorphic and nanoscale hardware. HDC/VSA operate with
hypervectors, i.e., distributed vector representations of large fixed dimension
(usually &gt; 1000). One of the key ingredients of HDC/VSA are the methods for
encoding data of various types (from numeric scalars and vectors to graphs)
into hypervectors. In this paper, we propose an approach for the formation of
hypervectors of sequences that provides both an equivariance with respect to
the shift of sequences and preserves the similarity of sequences with identical
elements at nearby positions. Our methods represent the sequence elements by
compositional hypervectors and exploit permutations of hypervectors for
representing the order of sequence elements. We experimentally explored the
proposed representations using a diverse set of tasks with data in the form of
symbolic strings. Although our approach is feature-free as it forms the
hypervector of a sequence from the hypervectors of its symbols at their
positions, it demonstrated the performance on a par with the methods that apply
various features, such as subsequences. The proposed techniques were designed
for the HDC/VSA model known as Sparse Binary Distributed Representations.
However, they can be adapted to hypervectors in formats of other HDC/VSA
models, as well as for representing sequences of types other than symbolic
strings.</span>

                    <span>Human mobility data accumulated from Point-of-Interest (POI) check-ins
provides great opportunity for user behavior understanding. However, data
quality issues (e.g., geolocation information missing, unreal check-ins, data
sparsity) in real-life mobility data limit the effectiveness of existing
POI-oriented studies, e.g., POI recommendation and location prediction, when
applied to real applications. To this end, in this paper, we develop a model,
named Bi-STDDP, which can integrate bi-directional spatio-temporal dependence
and users&#x27; dynamic preferences, to identify the missing POI check-in where a
user has visited at a specific time. Specifically, we first utilize
bi-directional global spatial and local temporal information of POIs to capture
the complex dependence relationships. Then, target temporal pattern in
combination with user and POI information are fed into a multi-layer network to
capture users&#x27; dynamic preferences. Moreover, the dynamic preferences are
transformed into the same space as the dependence relationships to form the
final model. Finally, the proposed model is evaluated on three large-scale
real-world datasets and the results demonstrate significant improvements of our
model compared with state-of-the-art methods. Also, it is worth noting that the
proposed model can be naturally extended to address POI recommendation and
location prediction tasks with competitive performances.</span>

occupational therapists. The foremost challenge of this neurodevelopmental
disorder lies in the fact of analyzing and exploring various symptoms of the
children at their early stage of development. Such early identification could
prop up the therapists and clinicians to provide proper assistive support to
make the children lead an independent life. Facial expressions and emotions
perceived by the children could contribute to such early intervention of
autism. In this regard, the paper implements in identifying basic facial
expression and exploring their emotions upon a time variant factor. The
emotions are analyzed by incorporating the facial expression identified through
CNN using 68 landmark points plotted on the frontal face with a prediction
network formed by RNN known as RCNN-FER system. The paper adopts R-CNN to take
the advantage of increased accuracy and performance with decreased time
complexity in predicting emotion as a textual network analysis. The papers

                    <span>Direct policy search serves as one of the workhorses in modern reinforcement
learning (RL), and its applications in continuous control tasks have recently
attracted increasing attention. In this work, we investigate the convergence
theory of policy gradient (PG) methods for learning the linear risk-sensitive
and robust controller. In particular, we develop PG methods that can be
implemented in a derivative-free fashion by sampling system trajectories, and
establish both global convergence and sample complexity results in the
solutions of two fundamental settings in risk-sensitive and robust control: the
finite-horizon linear exponential quadratic Gaussian, and the finite-horizon
linear-quadratic disturbance attenuation problems. As a by-product, our results
also provide the first sample complexity for the global convergence of PG
methods on solving zero-sum linear-quadratic dynamic games, a
nonconvex-nonconcave minimax optimization problem that serves as a baseline
setting in multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) with continuous spaces.
One feature of our algorithms is that during the learning phase, a certain
level of robustness/risk-sensitivity of the controller is preserved, which we
termed as the implicit regularization property, and is an essential requirement
in safety-critical control systems.</span>

                    <span>The analysis of long sequence data remains challenging in many real-world
applications. We propose a novel architecture, ChunkFormer, that improves the
existing Transformer framework to handle the challenges while dealing with long
time series. Original Transformer-based models adopt an attention mechanism to
discover global information along a sequence to leverage the contextual data.
Long sequential data traps local information such as seasonality and
fluctuations in short data sequences. In addition, the original Transformer
consumes more resources by carrying the entire attention matrix during the
training course. To overcome these challenges, ChunkFormer splits the long
sequences into smaller sequence chunks for the attention calculation,
progressively applying different chunk sizes in each stage. In this way, the
proposed model gradually learns both local and global information without
changing the total length of the input sequences. We have extensively tested
the effectiveness of this new architecture on different business domains and
have proved the advantage of such a model over the existing Transformer-based
models.</span>

                    <span>A/B testing, or online experiment is a standard business strategy to compare
a new product with an old one in pharmaceutical, technological, and traditional
industries. Major challenges arise in online experiments of two-sided
marketplace platforms (e.g., Uber) where there is only one unit that receives a
sequence of treatments over time. In those experiments, the treatment at a
given time impacts current outcome as well as future outcomes. The aim of this
paper is to introduce a reinforcement learning framework for carrying A/B
testing in these experiments, while characterizing the long-term treatment
effects. Our proposed testing procedure allows for sequential monitoring and
online updating. It is generally applicable to a variety of treatment designs
in different industries. In addition, we systematically investigate the
theoretical properties (e.g., size and power) of our testing procedure.
Finally, we apply our framework to both simulated data and a real-world data
example obtained from a technological company to illustrate its advantage over
the current practice. A Python implementation of our test is available at

                    <span>Many payment platforms hold large-scale marketing campaigns, which allocate
incentives to encourage users to pay through their applications. To maximize
the return on investment, incentive allocations are commonly solved in a
two-stage procedure. After training a response estimation model to estimate the
users&#x27; mobile payment probabilities (MPP), a linear programming process is
applied to obtain the optimal incentive allocation. However, the large amount
of biased data in the training set, generated by the previous biased allocation
policy, causes a biased estimation. This bias deteriorates the performance of
the response model and misleads the linear programming process, dramatically
degrading the performance of the resulting allocation policy. To overcome this
obstacle, we propose a bias correction adversarial network. Our method
leverages the small set of unbiased data obtained under a full-randomized
allocation policy to train an unbiased model and then uses it to reduce the
bias with adversarial learning. Offline and online experimental results
demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches and
significantly improves the performance of the resulting allocation policy in a
real-world marketing campaign.</span>

                    <span>Information-theoretic measures have been widely adopted in the design of
features for learning and decision problems. Inspired by this, we look at the
relationship between i) a weak form of information loss in the Shannon sense
and ii) the operation loss in the minimum probability of error (MPE) sense when
considering a family of lossy continuous representations (features) of a
continuous observation. We present several results that shed light on this
interplay. Our first result offers a lower bound on a weak form of information
loss as a function of its respective operation loss when adopting a discrete
lossy representation (quantization) instead of the original raw observation.
From this, our main result shows that a specific form of vanishing information
loss (a weak notion of asymptotic informational sufficiency) implies a
vanishing MPE loss (or asymptotic operational sufficiency) when considering a
general family of lossy continuous representations. Our theoretical findings
support the observation that the selection of feature representations that
attempt to capture informational sufficiency is appropriate for learning, but
this selection is a rather conservative design principle if the intended goal
is achieving MPE in classification. Supporting this last point, and under some
structural conditions, we show that it is possible to adopt an alternative
notion of informational sufficiency (strictly weaker than pure sufficiency in
the mutual information sense) to achieve operational sufficiency in learning.</span>

                    <span>The displacement of two immiscible fluids is a common problem in fluid flow
in porous media. Such a problem can be posed as a partial differential equation
(PDE) in what is commonly referred to as a Buckley-Leverett (B-L) problem. The
B-L problem is a non-linear hyperbolic conservation law that is known to be
notoriously difficult to solve using traditional numerical methods. Here, we
address the forward hyperbolic B-L problem with a nonconvex flux function using
physics-informed neural networks (PINNs). The contributions of this paper are
twofold. First, we present a PINN approach to solve the hyperbolic B-L problem
by embedding the Oleinik entropy condition into the neural network residual. We
do not use a diffusion term (artificial viscosity) in the residual-loss, but we
rely on the strong form of the PDE. Second, we use the Adam optimizer with
residual-based adaptive refinement (RAR) algorithm to achieve an ultra-low loss
without weighting. Our solution method can accurately capture the shock-front
and produce an accurate overall solution. We report a L2 validation error of 2
x 10-2 and a L2 loss of 1x 10-6. The proposed method does not require any
additional regularization or weighting of losses to obtain such accurate
solution.</span>

                    <span>The recent success of deep learning applications has coincided with those
widely available powerful computational resources for training sophisticated
machine learning models with huge datasets. Nonetheless, training large models
such as convolutional neural networks using model parallelism (as opposed to
data parallelism) is challenging because the complex nature of communication
between model shards makes it difficult to partition the computation
efficiently across multiple machines with an acceptable trade-off. This paper
presents SplitBrain, a high performance distributed deep learning framework
supporting hybrid data and model parallelism. Specifically, SplitBrain provides
layer-specific partitioning that co-locates compute intensive convolutional
layers while sharding memory demanding layers. A novel scalable group
communication is proposed to further improve the training throughput with
reduced communication overhead. The results show that SplitBrain can achieve
nearly linear speedup while saving up to 67\% of memory consumption for data
and model parallel VGG over CIFAR-10.</span>

                    <span>Learning powerful representations is one central theme of graph neural
networks (GNNs). It requires refining the critical information from the input
graph, instead of the trivial patterns, to enrich the representations. Towards
this end, graph attention and pooling methods prevail. They mostly follow the
paradigm of &quot;learning to attend&quot;. It maximizes the mutual information between
the attended subgraph and the ground-truth label. However, this training
paradigm is prone to capture the spurious correlations between the trivial
subgraph and the label. Such spurious correlations are beneficial to
in-distribution (ID) test evaluations, but cause poor generalization in the
out-of-distribution (OOD) test data. In this work, we revisit the GNN modeling
from the causal perspective. On the top of our causal assumption, the trivial
information serves as a confounder between the critical information and the
label, which opens a backdoor path between them and makes them spuriously
correlated. Hence, we present a new paradigm of deconfounded training (DTP)
that better mitigates the confounding effect and latches on the critical
information, to enhance the representation and generalization ability.
Specifically, we adopt the attention modules to disentangle the critical
subgraph and trivial subgraph. Then we make each critical subgraph fairly
interact with diverse trivial subgraphs to achieve a stable prediction. It
allows GNNs to capture a more reliable subgraph whose relation with the label
is robust across different distributions. We conduct extensive experiments on
synthetic and real-world datasets to demonstrate the effectiveness.</span>

                    <span>Dance choreography for a piece of music is a challenging task, having to be
creative in presenting distinctive stylistic dance elements while taking into
account the musical theme and rhythm. It has been tackled by different
approaches such as similarity retrieval, sequence-to-sequence modeling and
generative adversarial networks, but their generated dance sequences are often
short of motion realism, diversity and music consistency. In this paper, we
propose a Music-to-Dance with Optimal Transport Network (MDOT-Net) for learning
to generate 3D dance choreographs from music. We introduce an optimal transport
distance for evaluating the authenticity of the generated dance distribution
and a Gromov-Wasserstein distance to measure the correspondence between the
dance distribution and the input music. This gives a well defined and
non-divergent training objective that mitigates the limitation of standard GAN
training which is frequently plagued with instability and divergent generator
loss issues. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our MDOT-Net can synthesize
realistic and diverse dances which achieve an organic unity with the input
music, reflecting the shared intentionality and matching the rhythmic
articulation.</span>

developing ML-based applications and the current industry practices. Moreover,
it is unclear where software engineering researchers should focus their efforts

application development. We synthesize the results obtained from 80

                    <span>Multi-class classification is one of the most common tasks in machine
learning applications, where data is labeled by one of many class labels. Many
loss functions have been proposed for multi-class classification including two
well-known ones, namely the cross-entropy (CE) loss and the crammer-singer (CS)
loss (aka. the SVM loss). While CS loss has been used widely for traditional
machine learning tasks, CE loss is usually a default choice for multi-class
deep learning tasks. There are also top-$k$ variants of CS loss and CE loss
that are proposed to promote the learning of a classifier for achieving better
top-$k$ accuracy. Nevertheless, it still remains unclear the relationship
between these different losses, which hinders our understanding of their
expectations in different scenarios. In this paper, we present a unified view
of the CS/CE losses and their smoothed top-$k$ variants by proposing a new
family of loss functions, which are arguably better than the CS/CE losses when
the given label information is incomplete and noisy. The new family of smooth
loss functions named {label-distributionally robust (LDR) loss} is defined by
leveraging the distributionally robust optimization (DRO) framework to model
the uncertainty in the given label information, where the uncertainty over true
class labels is captured by using distributional weights for each label
regularized by a function.</span>

                    <span>Accurate decoding of surface electromyography (sEMG) is pivotal for
muscle-to-machine-interfaces (MMI) and their application for e.g.
rehabilitation therapy. sEMG signals have high inter-subject variability, due
to various factors, including skin thickness, body fat percentage, and
electrode placement. Therefore, obtaining high generalization quality of a
trained sEMG decoder is quite challenging. Usually, machine learning based sEMG
decoders are either trained on subject-specific data, or at least recalibrated
for each user, individually. Even though, deep learning algorithms produced
several state of the art results for sEMG decoding,however, due to the limited
amount of availability of sEMG data, the deep learning models are prone to
overfitting. Recently, transfer learning for domain adaptation improved
generalization quality with reduced training time on various machine learning
tasks. In this study, we investigate the effectiveness of transfer learning
using weight initialization for recalibration of two different pretrained deep
learning models on a new subjects data, and compare their performance to
subject-specific models. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study
that thoroughly investigated weight-initialization based transfer learning for
sEMG classification and compared transfer learning to subject-specific
modeling. We tested our models on three publicly available databases under
various settings. On average over all settings, our transfer learning approach
improves 5~\%-points on the pretrained models without fine-tuning and
12~\%-points on the subject-specific models, while being trained on average
22~\% fewer epochs. Our results indicate that transfer learning enables faster
training on fewer samples than user-specific models, and improves the
performance of pretrained models as long as enough data is available.</span>

                    <span>Many prediction tasks of real-world applications need to model multi-order
feature interactions in user&#x27;s event sequence for better detection performance.
However, existing popular solutions usually suffer two key issues: 1) only
focusing on feature interactions and failing to capture the sequence influence;
2) only focusing on sequence information, but ignoring internal feature
relations of each event, thus failing to extract a better event representation.
In this paper, we consider a two-level structure for capturing the hierarchical
information over user&#x27;s event sequence: 1) learning effective feature
interactions based event representation; 2) modeling the sequence
representation of user&#x27;s historical events. Experimental results on both
industrial and public datasets clearly demonstrate that our model achieves
significantly better performance compared with state-of-the-art baselines.</span>

                    <span>Illegal vehicle parking is a common urban problem faced by major cities in
the world, as it incurs traffic jams, which lead to air pollution and traffic
accidents. The government highly relies on active human efforts to detect
illegal parking events. However, such an approach is extremely ineffective to
cover a large city since the police have to patrol over the entire city roads.

The massive and high-quality sharing bike trajectories from Mobike offer us a
unique opportunity to design a ubiquitous illegal parking detection approach,
as most of the illegal parking events happen at curbsides and have significant
impact on the bike users. The detection result can guide the patrol schedule,
i.e. send the patrol policemen to the region with higher illegal parking risks,
and further improve the patrol efficiency. Inspired by this idea, three main
components are employed in the proposed framework: 1)~{\em trajectory
pre-processing}, which filters outlier GPS points, performs map-matching, and
builds trajectory indexes; 2)~{\em illegal parking detection}, which models the
normal trajectories, extracts features from the evaluation trajectories, and
utilizes a distribution test-based method to discover the illegal parking
events; and 3)~{\em patrol scheduling}, which leverages the detection result as
reference context, and models the scheduling task as a multi-agent
reinforcement learning problem to guide the patrol police. Finally, extensive
experiments are presented to validate the effectiveness of illegal parking
detection, as well as the improvement of patrol efficiency.</span>

                    <span>We introduce several new datasets namely ImageNet-A/O and ImageNet-R as well
as a synthetic environment and testing suite we called CAOS. ImageNet-A/O allow
researchers to focus in on the blind spots remaining in ImageNet. ImageNet-R
was specifically created with the intention of tracking robust representation
as the representations are no longer simply natural but include artistic, and
other renditions. The CAOS suite is built off of CARLA simulator which allows
for the inclusion of anomalous objects and can create reproducible synthetic
environment and scenes for testing robustness. All of the datasets were created
for testing robustness and measuring progress in robustness. The datasets have
been used in various other works to measure their own progress in robustness
and allowing for tangential progress that does not focus exclusively on natural
accuracy.

Given these datasets, we created several novel methods that aim to advance
robustness research. We build off of simple baselines in the form of Maximum
Logit, and Typicality Score as well as create a novel data augmentation method
in the form of DeepAugment that improves on the aforementioned benchmarks.
Maximum Logit considers the logit values instead of the values after the
softmax operation, while a small change produces noticeable improvements. The
Typicality Score compares the output distribution to a posterior distribution
over classes. We show that this improves performance over the baseline in all
but the segmentation task. Speculating that perhaps at the pixel level the
semantic information of a pixel is less meaningful than that of class level
information. Finally the new augmentation technique of DeepAugment utilizes
neural networks to create augmentations on images that are radically different
than the traditional geometric and camera based transformations used
previously.</span>

                    <span>Recent advances in machine learning have largely benefited from the massive
accessible training data. However, large-scale data sharing has raised great
privacy concerns. In this work, we propose a novel privacy-preserving data
Generative model based on the PATE framework (G-PATE), aiming to train a
scalable differentially private data generator that preserves high generated
data utility. Our approach leverages generative adversarial nets to generate
data, combined with private aggregation among different discriminators to
ensure strong privacy guarantees. Compared to existing approaches, G-PATE
significantly improves the use of privacy budgets. In particular, we train a
student data generator with an ensemble of teacher discriminators and propose a
novel private gradient aggregation mechanism to ensure differential privacy on
all information that flows from teacher discriminators to the student
generator. In addition, with random projection and gradient discretization, the
proposed gradient aggregation mechanism is able to effectively deal with
high-dimensional gradient vectors. Theoretically, we prove that G-PATE ensures
differential privacy for the data generator. Empirically, we demonstrate the
superiority of G-PATE over prior work through extensive experiments. We show
that G-PATE is the first work being able to generate high-dimensional image
data with high data utility under limited privacy budgets ($\epsilon \le 1$).

                    <span>This work is focused on the pruning of some convolutional neural networks
(CNNs) and improving theirs efficiency on graphic processing units (GPU) by
using a direct sparse algorithm. The Nvidia deep neural network (cuDnn) library
is the most effective implementations of deep learning (DL) algorithms for
GPUs. GPUs are the most commonly used accelerators for deep learning
computations. One of the most common techniques for improving the efficiency of
CNN models is weight pruning and quantization. There are two main types of
pruning: structural and non-structural. The first enables much easier
acceleration on many type of accelerators, but with this type it is difficult
to achieve a sparsity level and accuracy as high as that obtained with the
second type. Non-structural pruning with retraining can generate a weight
tensors up to 90% or more of sparsity in some deep CNN models. In this article
the pruning algorithm is presented which makes it possible to achieve high
sparsity levels without accuracy drop. In the next stage the linear and
non-linear quantization is adapted for further time and footprint reduction.
This paper is an extended of previously published paper concerning effective
pruning techniques and present real models pruned with high sparsities and
reduced precision which can achieve better performance than the CuDnn library.</span>

                    <span>Approximate message passing (AMP) is a low-cost iterative
parameter-estimation technique for certain high-dimensional linear systems with
non-Gaussian distributions. However, AMP only applies to independent
identically distributed (IID) transform matrices, but may become unreliable
(e.g., perform poorly or even diverge) for other matrix ensembles, especially
for ill-conditioned ones. Orthogonal/vector AMP (OAMP/VAMP) was proposed for
general right-unitarily-invariant matrices to handle this difficulty. However,
the Bayes-optimal OAMP/VAMP (BO-OAMP/VAMP) requires a high-complexity linear
minimum mean square error (MMSE) estimator. This limits the application of
OAMP/VAMP to large-scale systems.

To solve the disadvantages of AMP and BO-OAMP/VAMP, this paper proposes a
memory AMP (MAMP) framework under an orthogonality principle, which guarantees
the asymptotic IID Gaussianity of estimation errors in MAMP. We present an
orthogonalization procedure for the local memory estimators to realize the
required orthogonality for MAMP. Furthermore, we propose a Bayes-optimal MAMP
(BO-MAMP), in which a long-memory matched filter is proposed for interference
suppression. The complexity of BO-MAMP is comparable to AMP. A state evolution
is derived to asymptotically characterize the performance of BO-MAMP. Based on
state evolution, the relaxation parameters and damping vector in BO-MAMP are
optimized. For all right-unitarily-invariant matrices, the state evolution of
the optimized BO-MAMP converges to the same fixed point as that of the
high-complexity BO-OAMP/VAMP and is Bayes-optimal if its state evolution has a
unique fixed point. Finally, simulations are provided to verify the validity
and accuracy of the theoretical results.</span>

                    <span>We study reinforcement learning (RL) with linear function approximation.
Existing algorithms for this problem only have high-probability regret and/or
Probably Approximately Correct (PAC) sample complexity guarantees, which cannot
guarantee the convergence to the optimal policy. In this paper, in order to
overcome the limitation of existing algorithms, we propose a new algorithm
called FLUTE, which enjoys uniform-PAC convergence to the optimal policy with
high probability. The uniform-PAC guarantee is the strongest possible guarantee
for reinforcement learning in the literature, which can directly imply both PAC
and high probability regret bounds, making our algorithm superior to all
existing algorithms with linear function approximation. At the core of our
algorithm is a novel minimax value function estimator and a multi-level
partition scheme to select the training samples from historical observations.
Both of these techniques are new and of independent interest.</span>

                    <span>Long ties, the social ties that bridge different communities, are widely
believed to play crucial roles in spreading novel information in social
networks. However, some existing network theories and prediction models
indicate that long ties might dissolve quickly or eventually become redundant,
thus putting into question the long-term value of long ties. Our empirical
analysis of real-world dynamic networks shows that contrary to such reasoning,
long ties are more likely to persist than other social ties, and that many of
them constantly function as social bridges without being embedded in local
networks. Using a novel cost-benefit analysis model combined with machine
learning, we show that long ties are highly beneficial, which instinctively
motivates people to expend extra effort to maintain them. This partly explains
why long ties are more persistent than what has been suggested by many existing
theories and models. Overall, our study suggests the need for social
interventions that can promote the formation of long ties, such as mixing
people with diverse backgrounds.</span>

                    <span>In this work, we develop practical user scheduling algorithms for downlink
bursty traffic with emphasis on user fairness. In contrast to the conventional
scheduling algorithms that either equally divides the transmission time slots
among users or maximizing some ratios without physcial meanings, we propose to
use the 5%-tile user data rate (5TUDR) as the metric to evaluate user fairness.
Since it is difficult to directly optimize 5TUDR, we first cast the problem
into the stochastic game framework and subsequently propose a Multi-Agent
Reinforcement Learning (MARL)-based algorithm to perform distributed
optimization on the resource block group (RBG) allocation. Furthermore, each
MARL agent is designed to take information measured by network counters from
multiple network layers (e.g. Channel Quality Indicator, Buffer size) as the
input states while the RBG allocation as action with a proposed reward function
designed to maximize 5TUDR. Extensive simulation is performed to show that the
proposed MARL-based scheduler can achieve fair scheduling while maintaining
good average network throughput as compared to conventional schedulers.</span>

                    <span>Graphs can model complicated interactions between entities, which naturally
emerge in many important applications. These applications can often be cast
into standard graph learning tasks, in which a crucial step is to learn
low-dimensional graph representations. Graph neural networks (GNNs) are
currently the most popular model in graph embedding approaches. However,
standard GNNs in the neighborhood aggregation paradigm suffer from limited
discriminative power in distinguishing \emph{high-order} graph structures as
opposed to \emph{low-order} structures. To capture high-order structures,
researchers have resorted to motifs and developed motif-based GNNs. However,
existing motif-based GNNs still often suffer from less discriminative power on
high-order structures. To overcome the above limitations, we propose Motif
Graph Neural Network (MGNN), a novel framework to better capture high-order
structures, hinging on our proposed motif redundancy minimization operator and
injective motif combination. First, MGNN produces a set of node representations
w.r.t. each motif. The next phase is our proposed redundancy minimization among
motifs which compares the motifs with each other and distills the features
unique to each motif. Finally, MGNN performs the updating of node
representations by combining multiple representations from different motifs. In
particular, to enhance the discriminative power, MGNN utilizes an injective
function to combine the representations w.r.t. different motifs. We further
show that our proposed architecture increases the expressive power of GNNs with
a theoretical analysis. We demonstrate that MGNN outperforms state-of-the-art
methods on seven public benchmarks on both node classification and graph
classification tasks.</span>

                    <span>Recently, Vision Transformer (ViT) has continuously established new
milestones in the computer vision field, while the high computation and memory
cost makes its propagation in industrial production difficult. Pruning, a
traditional model compression paradigm for hardware efficiency, has been widely
applied in various DNN structures. Nevertheless, it stays ambiguous on how to
perform exclusive pruning on the ViT structure. Considering three key points:
the structural characteristics, the internal data pattern of ViTs, and the
related edge device deployment, we leverage the input token sparsity and
propose a computation-aware soft pruning framework, which can be set up on
vanilla Transformers of both flatten and CNN-type structures, such as
Pooling-based ViT (PiT). More concretely, we design a dynamic attention-based
multi-head token selector, which is a lightweight module for adaptive
instance-wise token selection. We further introduce a soft pruning technique,
which integrates the less informative tokens generated by the selector module
into a package token that will participate in subsequent calculations rather
than being completely discarded. Our framework is bound to the trade-off
between accuracy and computation constraints of specific edge devices through
our proposed computation-aware training strategy. Experimental results show
that our framework significantly reduces the computation cost of ViTs while
maintaining comparable performance on image classification. Moreover, our
framework can guarantee the identified model to meet resource specifications of
mobile devices and FPGA, and even achieve the real-time execution of DeiT-T on
mobile platforms. For example, our method reduces the latency of DeiT-T to 26
ms (26%$\sim $41% superior to existing works) on the mobile device with
0.25%$\sim $4% higher top-1 accuracy on ImageNet. Our code will be released
soon.</span>

                    <span>Large scale datasets created from crowdsourced labels or openly available
data have become crucial to provide training data for large scale learning
algorithms. While these datasets are easier to acquire, the data are frequently
noisy and unreliable, which is motivating research on weakly supervised
learning techniques. In this paper we propose original ideas that help us to
leverage such datasets in the context of change detection. First, we propose
the guided anisotropic diffusion (GAD) algorithm, which improves semantic
segmentation results using the input images as guides to perform edge
preserving filtering. We then show its potential in two weakly-supervised
learning strategies tailored for change detection. The first strategy is an
iterative learning method that combines model optimisation and data cleansing
using GAD to extract the useful information from a large scale change detection
dataset generated from open vector data. The second one incorporates GAD within
a novel spatial attention layer that increases the accuracy of weakly
supervised networks trained to perform pixel-level predictions from image-level
labels. Improvements with respect to state-of-the-art are demonstrated on 4
different public datasets.</span>

applying K-core decomposition on large graphs has attracted more and more
attention from academics and the industry. A simple but effective method to
deal with large graphs is to train them in the distributed settings, and some
distributed K-core decomposition algorithms are also proposed. Despite their
effectiveness, we experimentally and theoretically observe that these
algorithms consume too many resources and become unstable on super-large-scale
graphs, especially when the given resources are limited. In this paper, we deal
with those super-large-scale graphs and propose a divide-and-conquer strategy
on top of the distributed K-core decomposition algorithm. We evaluate our
approach on three large graphs. The experimental results show that the
consumption of resources can be significantly reduced, and the calculation on
large-scale graphs becomes more stable than the existing methods. For example,
the distributed K-core decomposition algorithm can scale to a large graph with
136 billion edges without losing correctness with our divide-and-conquer
technique.</span>

                    <span>One of the main challenges of Topological Data Analysis (TDA) is to extract
features from persistent diagrams directly usable by machine learning
algorithms. Indeed, persistence diagrams are intrinsically (multi-)sets of
points in R2 and cannot be seen in a straightforward manner as vectors. In this
article, we introduce Persformer, the first Transformer neural network
architecture that accepts persistence diagrams as input. The Persformer
architecture significantly outperforms previous topological neural network
architectures on classical synthetic benchmark datasets. Moreover, it satisfies
a universal approximation theorem. This allows us to introduce the first
interpretability method for topological machine learning, which we explore in
two examples.</span>

                    <span>Could we automatically derive the score of a piano accompaniment based on the
audio of a pop song? This is the audio-to-symbolic arrangement problem we
tackle in this paper. A good arrangement model should not only consider the
audio content but also have prior knowledge of piano composition (so that the
generation &quot;sounds like&quot; the audio and meanwhile maintains musicality.) To this
end, we contribute a cross-modal representation-learning model, which 1)
extracts chord and melodic information from the audio, and 2) learns texture
representation from both audio and a corrupted ground truth arrangement. We
further introduce a tailored training strategy that gradually shifts the source
of texture information from corrupted score to audio. In the end, the
score-based texture posterior is reduced to a standard normal distribution, and
only audio is needed for inference. Experiments show that our model captures
major audio information and outperforms baselines in generation quality.</span>

                    <span>Objective: To determine if a realistic, but computationally efficient model
of the electrocardiogram can be used to pre-train a deep neural network (DNN)
with a wide range of morphologies and abnormalities specific to a given
condition - T-wave Alternans (TWA) as a result of Post-Traumatic Stress
Disorder, or PTSD - and significantly boost performance on a small database of
rare individuals.

Approach: Using a previously validated artificial ECG model, we generated
180,000 artificial ECGs with or without significant TWA, with varying heart
rate, breathing rate, TWA amplitude, and ECG morphology. A DNN, trained on over
70,000 patients to classify 25 different rhythms, was modified the output layer
to a binary class (TWA or no-TWA, or equivalently, PTSD or no-PTSD), and
transfer learning was performed on the artificial ECG. In a final transfer
learning step, the DNN was trained and cross-validated on ECG from 12 PTSD and
24 controls for all combinations of using the three databases.

Main results: The best performing approach (AUROC &#x3D; 0.77, Accuracy &#x3D; 0.72,
F1-score &#x3D; 0.64) was found by performing both transfer learning steps, using
the pre-trained arrhythmia DNN, the artificial data and the real PTSD-related
ECG data. Removing the artificial data from training led to the largest drop in
performance. Removing the arrhythmia data from training provided a modest, but
significant, drop in performance. The final model showed no significant drop in
performance on the artificial data, indicating no overfitting.

Significance: In healthcare, it is common to only have a small collection of
high-quality data and labels, or a larger database with much lower quality (and
less relevant) labels. The paradigm presented here, involving model-based
performance boosting, provides a solution through transfer learning on a large
realistic artificial database, and a partially relevant real database.</span>

                    <span>Designing manufacturing processes with high yield and strong reliability
relies on effective methods for rare event estimation. Genealogical importance
splitting reduces the variance of rare event probability estimators by
iteratively selecting and replicating realizations that are headed towards a
rare event. The replication step is difficult when applied to deterministic
systems where the initial conditions of the offspring realizations need to be
modified. Typically, a random perturbation is applied to the offspring to
differentiate their trajectory from the parent realization. However, this
random perturbation strategy may be effective for some systems while failing
for others, preventing variance reduction in the probability estimate. This
work seeks to address this limitation using a generative model such as a
Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) to generate perturbations that are
consistent with the attractor of the dynamical system. The proposed
GAN-assisted Importance SPlitting method (GANISP) improves the variance
reduction for the system targeted. An implementation of the method is available
in a companion repository (https://github.com/NREL/GANISP).</span>

                    <span>In the last decade, many deep learning models have been well trained and made
a great success in various fields of machine intelligence, especially for
computer vision and natural language processing. To better leverage the
potential of these well-trained models in intra-domain or cross-domain transfer
learning situations, knowledge distillation (KD) and domain adaptation (DA) are
proposed and become research highlights. They both aim to transfer useful
information from a well-trained model with original training data. However, the
original data is not always available in many cases due to privacy, copyright
or confidentiality. Recently, the data-free knowledge transfer paradigm has
attracted appealing attention as it deals with distilling valuable knowledge
from well-trained models without requiring to access to the training data. In
particular, it mainly consists of the data-free knowledge distillation (DFKD)
and source data-free domain adaptation (SFDA). On the one hand, DFKD aims to
transfer the intra-domain knowledge of original data from a cumbersome teacher
network to a compact student network for model compression and efficient
inference. On the other hand, the goal of SFDA is to reuse the cross-domain
knowledge stored in a well-trained source model and adapt it to a target
domain. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive survey on data-free knowledge
transfer from the perspectives of knowledge distillation and unsupervised
domain adaptation, to help readers have a better understanding of the current
research status and ideas. Applications and challenges of the two areas are
briefly reviewed, respectively. Furthermore, we provide some insights to the
subject of future research.</span>

                    <span>6G will move mobile networks towards increasing levels of complexity. To deal
with this complexity, optimization of network parameters is key to ensure high
performance and timely adaptivity to dynamic network environments. The
optimization of the antenna tilt provides a practical and cost-efficient method
to improve coverage and capacity in the network. Previous methods based on
Reinforcement Learning (RL) have shown great promise for tilt optimization by
learning adaptive policies outperforming traditional tilt optimization methods.
However, most existing RL methods are based on single-cell features
representation, which fails to fully characterize the agent state, resulting in
suboptimal performance. Also, most of such methods lack scalability, due to
state-action explosion, and generalization ability. In this paper, we propose a
Graph Attention Q-learning (GAQ) algorithm for tilt optimization. GAQ relies on
a graph attention mechanism to select relevant neighbors information, improve
the agent state representation, and update the tilt control policy based on a
history of observations using a Deep Q-Network (DQN). We show that GAQ
efficiently captures important network information and outperforms standard DQN
with local information by a large margin. In addition, we demonstrate its
ability to generalize to network deployments of different sizes and densities.</span>

                    <span>Generative models can be trained to emulate complex empirical data, but are
they useful to make predictions in the context of previously unobserved
environments? An intuitive idea to promote such extrapolation capabilities is
to have the architecture of such model reflect a causal graph of the true data
generating process, such that one can intervene on each node independently of
the others. However, the nodes of this graph are usually unobserved, leading to
overparameterization and lack of identifiability of the causal structure. We
develop a theoretical framework to address this challenging situation by
defining a weaker form of identifiability, based on the principle of
independence of mechanisms. We demonstrate on toy examples that classical
stochastic gradient descent can hinder the model&#x27;s extrapolation capabilities,
suggesting independence of mechanisms should be enforced explicitly during
training. Experiments on deep generative models trained on real world data
support these insights and illustrate how the extrapolation capabilities of
such models can be leveraged.</span>

                    <span>We consider Bayesian optimization of the output of a network of functions,
where each function takes as input the output of its parent nodes, and where
the network takes significant time to evaluate. Such problems arise, for
example, in reinforcement learning, engineering design, and manufacturing.
While the standard Bayesian optimization approach observes only the final
output, our approach delivers greater query efficiency by leveraging
information that the former ignores: intermediate output within the network.
This is achieved by modeling the nodes of the network using Gaussian processes
and choosing the points to evaluate using, as our acquisition function, the
expected improvement computed with respect to the implied posterior on the
objective. Although the non-Gaussian nature of this posterior prevents
computing our acquisition function in closed form, we show that it can be
efficiently maximized via sample average approximation. In addition, we prove
that our method is asymptotically consistent, meaning that it finds a globally
optimal solution as the number of evaluations grows to infinity, thus
generalizing previously known convergence results for the expected improvement.
Notably, this holds even though our method might not evaluate the domain
densely, instead leveraging problem structure to leave regions unexplored.
Finally, we show that our approach dramatically outperforms standard Bayesian
optimization methods in several synthetic and real-world problems.</span>

                    <span>In recent years, gradient based Meta-RL (GMRL) methods have achieved
remarkable successes in either discovering effective online hyperparameter for
one single task (Xu et al., 2018) or learning good initialisation for
multi-task transfer learning (Finn et al., 2017). Despite the empirical
successes, it is often neglected that computing meta gradients via vanilla
backpropagation is ill-defined. In this paper, we argue that the stochastic
meta-gradient estimation adopted by many existing MGRL methods are in fact
biased; the bias comes from two sources: 1) the compositional bias that is
inborn in the structure of compositional optimisation problems and 2) the bias
of multi-step Hessian estimation caused by direct automatic differentiation. To
better understand the meta gradient biases, we perform the first of its kind
study to quantify the amount for each of them. We start by providing a unifying
derivation for existing GMRL algorithms, and then theoretically analyse both
the bias and the variance of existing gradient estimation methods. On
understanding the underlying principles of bias, we propose two mitigation
solutions based on off-policy correction and multi-step Hessian estimation
techniques. Comprehensive ablation studies have been conducted and results
reveals: (1) The existence of these two biases and how they influence the
meta-gradient estimation when combined with different estimator/sample
size/step and learning rate. (2) The effectiveness of these mitigation
approaches for meta-gradient estimation and thereby the final return on two
practical Meta-RL algorithms: LOLA-DiCE and Meta-gradient Reinforcement
Learning.</span>

classification that are transferable to new, unseen classes. Recent results in
the literature show that representations learned by a single classifier over
many classes are competitive on few-shot learning problems with representations
learned by special-purpose algorithms designed for such problems. In this paper
we provide an explanation for this behavior based on the recently observed
phenomenon that the features learned by overparameterized classification
networks show an interesting clustering property, called neural collapse. We
demonstrate both theoretically and empirically that neural collapse generalizes
to new samples from the training classes, and -- more importantly -- to new
classes as well, allowing foundation models to provide feature maps that work
well in transfer learning and, specifically, in the few-shot setting.</span>

                    <span>In this work, we review and evaluate a body of deep learning knowledge
tracing (DLKT) models with openly available and widely-used data sets, and with
a novel data set of students learning to program. The evaluated DLKT models
have been reimplemented for assessing reproducibility and replicability of
previously reported results. We test different input and output layer
variations found in the compared models that are independent of the main
architectures of the models, and different maximum attempt count options that
have been implicitly and explicitly used in some studies. Several metrics are
used to reflect on the quality of the evaluated knowledge tracing models. The
evaluated knowledge tracing models include Vanilla-DKT, two Long Short-Term
Memory Deep Knowledge Tracing (LSTM-DKT) variants, two Dynamic Key-Value Memory
Network (DKVMN) variants, and Self-Attentive Knowledge Tracing (SAKT). We
evaluate logistic regression, Bayesian Knowledge Tracing (BKT) and simple
non-learning models as baselines. Our results suggest that the DLKT models in
general outperform non-DLKT models, and the relative differences between the
DLKT models are subtle and often vary between datasets. Our results also show
that naive models such as mean prediction can yield better performance than
more sophisticated knowledge tracing models, especially in terms of accuracy.
Further, our metric and hyperparameter analysis shows that the metric used to
select the best model hyperparameters has a noticeable effect on the
performance of the models, and that metric choice can affect model ranking. We
also study the impact of input and output layer variations, filtering out long
attempt sequences, and non-model properties such as randomness and hardware.
Finally, we discuss model performance replicability and related issues. Our
model implementations, evaluation code, and data are published as a part of

aimed to maximize the expected reward, which are thus useful in searching the
optimized candidate with the highest reward (function value) for diverse
applications (e.g., AlphaGo). However, in some typical application scenaios
such as drug discovery, the aim is to search a diverse set of candidates with
high reward. Here we propose a reversible upper confidence bound (rUCB)
algorithm for such a purpose, and demonstrate its application in virtual
screening upon intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs). It is shown that rUCB
greatly reduces the query times while achieving both high accuracy and low
performance loss.The rUCB may have potential application in multipoint
optimization and other reinforcement-learning cases.</span>

                    <span>Turbulence simulation with classical numerical solvers requires very
high-resolution grids to accurately resolve dynamics. Here we train learned
simulators at low spatial and temporal resolutions to capture turbulent
dynamics generated at high resolution. We show that our proposed model can
simulate turbulent dynamics more accurately than classical numerical solvers at
the same low resolutions across various scientifically relevant metrics. Our
model is trained end-to-end from data and is capable of learning a range of
challenging chaotic and turbulent dynamics at low resolution, including
trajectories generated by the state-of-the-art Athena++ engine. We show that
our simpler, general-purpose architecture outperforms various more specialized,
turbulence-specific architectures from the learned turbulence simulation
literature. In general, we see that learned simulators yield unstable
trajectories; however, we show that tuning training noise and temporal
downsampling solves this problem. We also find that while generalization beyond
the training distribution is a challenge for learned models, training noise,
convolutional architectures, and added loss constraints can help. Broadly, we
conclude that our learned simulator outperforms traditional solvers run on
coarser grids, and emphasize that simple design choices can offer stability and
robust generalization.</span>

                    <span>Deep graph clustering, which aims to reveal the underlying graph structure
and divide the nodes into different groups, has attracted intensive attention
in recent years. However, we observe that, in the process of node encoding,
existing methods suffer from representation collapse which tends to map all
data into the same representation. Consequently, the discriminative capability
of the node representation is limited, leading to unsatisfied clustering
performance. To address this issue, we propose a novel self-supervised deep
graph clustering method termed Dual Correlation Reduction Network (DCRN) by
reducing information correlation in a dual manner. Specifically, in our method,
we first design a siamese network to encode samples. Then by forcing the
cross-view sample correlation matrix and cross-view feature correlation matrix
to approximate two identity matrices, respectively, we reduce the information
correlation in the dual-level, thus improving the discriminative capability of
the resulting features. Moreover, in order to alleviate representation collapse
caused by over-smoothing in GCN, we introduce a propagation regularization term
to enable the network to gain long-distance information with the shallow
network structure. Extensive experimental results on six benchmark datasets
demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed DCRN against the existing
state-of-the-art methods.</span>

                    <span>Active learning (AL) is a machine learning algorithm that can achieve greater
accuracy with fewer labeled training instances, for having the ability to ask
oracles to label the most valuable unlabeled data chosen iteratively and
heuristically by query strategies. Scientific experiments nowadays, though
becoming increasingly automated, are still suffering from human involvement in
the designing process and the exhaustive search in the experimental space. This
article performs a retrospective study on a drug response dataset using the
proposed AL scheme comprised of the matrix factorization method of alternating
least square (ALS) and deep neural networks (DNN). This article also proposes
an AL query strategy based on expected loss minimization. As a result, the
retrospective study demonstrates that scientific experimental design, instead
of being manually set, can be optimized by AL, and the proposed query strategy
ELM sampling shows better experimental performance than other ones such as
random sampling and uncertainty sampling.</span>

                    <span>Each grid block in a 3D geological model requires a rock type that represents
all physical and chemical properties of that block. The properties that
classify rock types are lithology, permeability, and capillary pressure.
Scientists and engineers determined these properties using conventional
laboratory measurements, which embedded destructive methods to the sample or
altered some of its properties (i.e., wettability, permeability, and porosity)
because the measurements process includes sample crushing, fluid flow, or fluid
saturation. Lately, Digital Rock Physics (DRT) has emerged to quantify these
properties from micro-Computerized Tomography (uCT) and Magnetic Resonance
Imaging (MRI) images. However, the literature did not attempt rock typing in a
wholly digital context. We propose performing Digital Rock Typing (DRT) by: (1)
integrating the latest DRP advances in a novel process that honors digital rock
properties determination, while; (2) digitalizing the latest rock typing
approaches in carbonate, and (3) introducing a novel carbonate rock typing
process that utilizes computer vision capabilities to provide more insight
about the heterogeneous carbonate rock texture.</span>

                    <span>Suppose we have a black-box function (e.g., deep neural network) that takes
an image as input and outputs a value that indicates preference. How can we
retrieve optimal images with respect to this function from an external database
on the Internet? Standard retrieval problems in the literature (e.g., item
recommendations) assume that an algorithm has full access to the set of items.
In other words, such algorithms are designed for service providers. In this
paper, we consider the retrieval problem under different assumptions.
Specifically, we consider how users with limited access to an image database
can retrieve images using their own black-box functions. This formulation
enables a flexible and finer-grained image search defined by each user. We
assume the user can access the database through a search query with tight API
limits. Therefore, a user needs to efficiently retrieve optimal images in terms
of the number of queries. We propose an efficient retrieval algorithm Tiara for
this problem. In the experiments, we confirm that our proposed method performs
better than several baselines under various settings.</span>

                    <span>Establishing a fast rate of convergence for optimization methods is crucial
to their applicability in practice. With the increasing popularity of deep
learning over the past decade, stochastic gradient descent and its adaptive
variants (e.g. Adagrad, Adam, etc.) have become prominent methods of choice for
machine learning practitioners. While a large number of works have demonstrated
that these first order optimization methods can achieve sub-linear or linear
convergence, we establish local quadratic convergence for stochastic gradient

                    <span>Rhetorical Frames in AI can be thought of as expressions that describe AI
development as a competition between two or more actors, such as governments or
companies. Examples of such Frames include robotic arms race, AI rivalry,
technological supremacy, cyberwarfare dominance and 5G race. Detection of
Rhetorical Frames from open sources can help us track the attitudes of
governments or companies towards AI, specifically whether attitudes are
becoming more cooperative or competitive over time. Given the rapidly
increasing volumes of open sources (online news media, twitter, blogs), it is
difficult for subject matter experts to identify Rhetorical Frames in (near)
real-time. Moreover, these sources are in general unstructured (noisy) and
therefore, detecting Frames from these sources will require state-of-the-art
text classification techniques. In this paper, we develop RheFrameDetect, a
text classification system for (near) real-time capture of Rhetorical Frames
from open sources. Given an input document, RheFrameDetect employs text
classification techniques at multiple levels (document level and paragraph
level) to identify all occurrences of Frames used in the discussion of AI. We
performed extensive evaluation of the text classification techniques used in
RheFrameDetect against human annotated Frames from multiple news sources. To
further demonstrate the effectiveness of RheFrameDetect, we show multiple case
studies depicting the Frames identified by RheFrameDetect compared against
human annotated Frames.</span>

                    <span>During the SARS-Cov-2 pandemic, mask-wearing became an effective tool to
prevent spreading and contracting the virus. The ability to monitor the
mask-wearing rate in the population would be useful for determining public
health strategies against the virus. However, artificial intelligence
technologies for detecting face masks have not been deployed at a large scale
in real-life to measure the mask-wearing rate in public. In this paper, we
present a two-step face mask detection approach consisting of two separate
modules: 1) face detection and alignment and 2) face mask classification. This
approach allowed us to experiment with different combinations of face detection
and face mask classification modules. More specifically, we experimented with
PyramidKey and RetinaFace as face detectors while maintaining a lightweight
backbone for the face mask classification module. Moreover, we also provide a
relabeled annotation of the test set of the AIZOO dataset, where we rectified
the incorrect labels for some face images. The evaluation results on the AIZOO
and Moxa 3K datasets showed that the proposed face mask detection pipeline
surpassed the state-of-the-art methods. The proposed pipeline also yielded a
higher mAP on the relabeled test set of the AIZOO dataset than the original
test set. Since we trained the proposed model using in-the-wild face images, we
can successfully deploy our model to monitor the mask-wearing rate using public
CCTV images.</span>

                    <span>Domain adaptation tasks such as cross-domain sentiment classification aim to
utilize existing labeled data in the source domain and unlabeled or few labeled
data in the target domain to improve the performance in the target domain via
reducing the shift between the data distributions. Existing cross-domain
sentiment classification methods need to distinguish pivots, i.e., the
domain-shared sentiment words, and non-pivots, i.e., the domain-specific
sentiment words, for excellent adaptation performance. In this paper, we first
design a Category Attention Network (CAN), and then propose a model named
CAN-CNN to integrate CAN and a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). On the one
hand, the model regards pivots and non-pivots as unified category attribute
words and can automatically capture them to improve the domain adaptation
performance; on the other hand, the model makes an attempt at interpretability
to learn the transferred category attribute words. Specifically, the
optimization objective of our model has three different components: 1) the
supervised classification loss; 2) the distributions loss of category feature
weights; 3) the domain invariance loss. Finally, the proposed model is
evaluated on three public sentiment analysis datasets and the results
demonstrate that CAN-CNN can outperform other various baseline methods.</span>

                    <span>Graph neural networks (GNN) have shown outstanding applications in many
fields where data is fundamentally represented as graphs (e.g., chemistry,
biology, recommendation systems). In this vein, communication networks comprise
many fundamental components that are naturally represented in a
graph-structured manner (e.g., topology, configurations, traffic flows). This
position article presents GNNs as a fundamental tool for modeling, control and
management of communication networks. GNNs represent a new generation of
data-driven models that can accurately learn and reproduce the complex
behaviors behind real networks. As a result, such models can be applied to a
wide variety of networking use cases, such as planning, online optimization, or
troubleshooting. The main advantage of GNNs over traditional neural networks
lies in its unprecedented generalization capabilities when applied to other
networks and configurations unseen during training, which is a critical feature
for achieving practical data-driven solutions for networking. This article
comprises a brief tutorial on GNNs and their possible applications to
communication networks. To showcase the potential of this technology, we
present two use cases with state-of-the-art GNN models respectively applied to
wired and wireless networks. Lastly, we delve into the key open challenges and

Densenet161 has been shown to have high precision whilst Resnet101 has a high

                    <span>The transformation of conventional power networks into smart grids with the
heavy penetration level of renewable energy resources, particularly
grid-connected Photovoltaic (PV) systems, has increased the need for efficient
fault identification systems. Malfunctioning any single component in
grid-connected PV systems may lead to grid instability and other serious
consequences, showing that a reliable fault identification system is the utmost
requirement for ensuring operational integrity. Therefore, this paper presents
a novel fault identification approach based on statistical signatures of PV
operational states. These signatures are unique because each fault has a
different nature and distinctive impact on the electrical system. Thus, the
Random Forest Classifier trained on these extracted signatures showed 100%
accuracy in identifying all types of faults. Furthermore, the performance
comparison of the proposed framework with other Machine Learning classifiers
depicts its credibility. Moreover, to elevate user trust in the predicted
outcomes, SHAP (Shapley Additive Explanation) was utilized during the training
phase to extract a complete model response (global explanation). This extracted
global explanation can help in the assessment of predicted outcomes credibility
by decoding each prediction in terms of features contribution. Hence, the
proposed explainable signature-based fault identification technique is highly
credible and fulfills all the requirements of smart grids.</span>

                    <span>Stochastic and soft optimal policies resulting from entropy-regularized
Markov decision processes (ER-MDP) are desirable for exploration and imitation
learning applications. Motivated by the fact that such policies are sensitive
with respect to the state transition probabilities, and the estimation of these
probabilities may be inaccurate, we study a robust version of the ER-MDP model,
where the stochastic optimal policies are required to be robust with respect to
the ambiguity in the underlying transition probabilities. Our work is at the
crossroads of two important schemes in reinforcement learning (RL), namely,
robust MDP and entropy regularized MDP. We show that essential properties that
hold for the non-robust ER-MDP and robust unregularized MDP models also hold in
our settings, making the robust ER-MDP problem tractable. We show how our
framework and results can be integrated into different algorithmic schemes
including value or (modified) policy iteration, which would lead to new robust
RL and inverse RL algorithms to handle uncertainties. Analyses on computational
complexity and error propagation under conventional uncertainty settings are

TD-learning is a linear stochastic iterative algorithm to estimate the value
function of a given policy for a Markov decision process, which is one of the
most popular and fundamental reinforcement learning algorithms. While there has
been a series of successful works in theoretical analysis of TD-learning, it
was not until recently that researchers found some guarantees on its
statistical efficiency. In this paper, we propose a control theoretic

                    <span>We study the problem of learning a good set of policies, so that when
combined together, they can solve a wide variety of unseen reinforcement
learning tasks with no or very little new data. Specifically, we consider the
framework of generalized policy evaluation and improvement, in which the
rewards for all tasks of interest are assumed to be expressible as a linear
combination of a fixed set of features. We show theoretically that, under
certain assumptions, having access to a specific set of diverse policies, which
we call a set of independent policies, can allow for instantaneously achieving
high-level performance on all possible downstream tasks which are typically
more complex than the ones on which the agent was trained. Based on this
theoretical analysis, we propose a simple algorithm that iteratively constructs
this set of policies. In addition to empirically validating our theoretical
results, we compare our approach with recently proposed diverse policy set
construction methods and show that, while others fail, our approach is able to
build a behavior basis that enables instantaneous transfer to all possible
downstream tasks. We also show empirically that having access to a set of
independent policies can better bootstrap the learning process on downstream
tasks where the new reward function cannot be described as a linear combination
of the features. Finally, we demonstrate that this policy set can be useful in
a realistic lifelong reinforcement learning setting.</span>

                    <span>Support vector machine (SVM) is a powerful classification method that has
achieved great success in many fields. Since its performance can be seriously
impaired by redundant covariates, model selection techniques are widely used
for SVM with high dimensional covariates. As an alternative to model selection,
significant progress has been made in the area of model averaging in the past
decades. Yet no frequentist model averaging method was considered for SVM. This
work aims to fill the gap and to propose a frequentist model averaging
procedure for SVM which selects the optimal weight by cross validation. Even
when the number of covariates diverges at an exponential rate of the sample
size, we show asymptotic optimality of the proposed method in the sense that
the ratio of its hinge loss to the lowest possible loss converges to one. We
also derive the convergence rate which provides more insights to model
averaging. Compared to model selection methods of SVM which require a tedious
but critical task of tuning parameter selection, the model averaging method
avoids the task and shows promising performances in the empirical studies.</span>

                    <span>In this paper, we focus on the decentralized optimization problem over the
Stiefel manifold, which is defined on a connected network of $d$ agents. The
objective is an average of $d$ local functions, and each function is privately
held by an agent and encodes its data. The agents can only communicate with
their neighbors in a collaborative effort to solve this problem. In existing
methods, multiple rounds of communications are required to guarantee the
convergence, giving rise to high communication costs. In contrast, this paper
proposes a decentralized algorithm, called DESTINY, which only invokes a single
round of communications per iteration. DESTINY combines gradient tracking
techniques with a novel approximate augmented Lagrangian function. The global
convergence to stationary points is rigorously established. Comprehensive
numerical experiments demonstrate that DESTINY has a strong potential to
deliver a cutting-edge performance in solving a variety of testing problems.</span>

                    <span>The current work intends to study the performance of the Hierarchical
Temporal Memory(HTM) theory for automated classification of text as well as
documents. HTM is a biologically inspired theory based on the working
principles of the human neocortex. The current study intends to provide an
alternative framework for document categorization using the Spatial Pooler
learning algorithm in the HTM Theory. As HTM accepts only a stream of binary
data as input, Latent Semantic Indexing(LSI) technique is used for extracting
the top features from the input and converting them into binary format. The
Spatial Pooler algorithm converts the binary input into sparse patterns with
similar input text having overlapping spatial patterns making it easy for
classifying the patterns into categories. The results obtained prove that HTM
theory, although is in its nascent stages, performs at par with most of the
popular machine learning based classifiers.</span>

                    <span>Classification predictive modeling involves the accurate assignment of
observations in a dataset to target classes or categories. There is an
increasing growth of real-world classification problems with severely
imbalanced class distributions. In this case, minority classes have much fewer
observations to learn from than those from majority classes. Despite this
sparsity, a minority class is often considered the more interesting class yet
developing a scientific learning algorithm suitable for the observations
presents countless challenges. In this article, we suggest a novel multi-class
classification algorithm specialized to handle severely imbalanced classes
based on the method we refer to as SAMME.C2. It blends the flexible mechanics
of the boosting techniques from SAMME algorithm, a multi-class classifier, and
Ada.C2 algorithm, a cost-sensitive binary classifier designed to address highly
class imbalances. Not only do we provide the resulting algorithm but we also
establish scientific and statistical formulation of our proposed SAMME.C2
algorithm. Through numerical experiments examining various degrees of
classifier difficulty, we demonstrate consistent superior performance of our
proposed model.</span>

                    <span>Various applications of farm animal imaging are based on the estimation of
weights of certain body parts and cuts from the CT images of animals. In many
cases, the complexity of the problem is increased by the enormous variability
of postures in CT images due to the scanning of non-sedated, living animals. In
this paper, we propose a general and robust approach for the estimation of the
weights of cuts and body parts from the CT images of (possibly) living animals.
We adapt multi-atlas based segmentation driven by elastic registration and
joint feature and model selection for the regression component to cape with the
large number of features and low number of samples. The proposed technique is
evaluated and illustrated through real applications in rabbit breeding
programs, showing r^2 scores 12% higher than previous techniques and methods
that used to drive the selection so far. The proposed technique is easily
adaptable to similar problems, consequently, it is shared in an open source
software package for the benefit of the community.</span>

                    <span>Heterogeneous graph neural networks (HGNNs) have been blossoming in recent
years, but the unique data processing and evaluation setups used by each work
obstruct a full understanding of their advancements. In this work, we present a
systematical reproduction of 12 recent HGNNs by using their official codes,
datasets, settings, and hyperparameters, revealing surprising findings about
the progress of HGNNs. We find that the simple homogeneous GNNs, e.g., GCN and
GAT, are largely underestimated due to improper settings. GAT with proper
inputs can generally match or outperform all existing HGNNs across various
scenarios. To facilitate robust and reproducible HGNN research, we construct
the Heterogeneous Graph Benchmark (HGB), consisting of 11 diverse datasets with
three tasks. HGB standardizes the process of heterogeneous graph data splits,
feature processing, and performance evaluation. Finally, we introduce a simple
but very strong baseline Simple-HGN--which significantly outperforms all
previous models on HGB--to accelerate the advancement of HGNNs in the future.</span>

                    <span>Quantizing deep neural networks (DNNs) has been a promising solution for
deploying deep neural networks on embedded devices. However, most of the
existing methods do not quantize gradients, and the process of quantizing DNNs
still has a lot of floating-point operations, which hinders the further
applications of quantized DNNs. To solve this problem, we propose a new
heuristic method based on cooperative coevolution for quantizing DNNs. Under
the framework of cooperative coevolution, we use the estimation of distribution
algorithm to search for the low-bits weights. Specifically, we first construct
an initial quantized network from a pre-trained network instead of random
initialization and then start searching from it by restricting the search
space. So far, the problem is the largest discrete problem known to be solved
by evolutionary algorithms. Experiments show that our method can train 4 bit

than text. However, in order for content creators to produce videos with a high
click-through rate, much editing is needed to match the footage to the music.
This posts additional challenges for more amateur video makers. Therefore, we
propose a novel attention-based model VMT (Video-Music Transformer) that
automatically generates piano scores from video frames. Using music generated
from models also prevent potential copyright infringements that often come with
using existing music. To the best of our knowledge, there is no work besides
the proposed VMT that aims to compose music for video. Additionally, there
lacks a dataset with aligned video and symbolic music. We release a new dataset
composed of over 7 hours of piano scores with fine alignment between pop music
videos and MIDI files. We conduct experiments with human evaluation on VMT,
SeqSeq model (our baseline), and the original piano version soundtrack. VMT
achieves consistent improvements over the baseline on music smoothness and
video relevance. In particular, with the relevance scores and our case study,
our model has shown the capability of multimodality on frame-level actors&#x27;
movement for music generation. Our VMT model, along with the new dataset,

                    <span>Image synthesis and image recognition have witnessed remarkable progress, but
often at the expense of computationally expensive training and inference.
Learning lightweight yet expressive deep model has emerged as an important and
interesting direction. Inspired by the well-known split-transform-aggregate
design heuristic in the Inception building block, this paper proposes a
Skip-Layer Inception Module (SLIM) that facilitates efficient learning of image
synthesis models, and a same-layer variant (dubbed as SLIM too) as a stronger
alternative to the well-known ResNeXts for image recognition. In SLIM, the
input feature map is first split into a number of groups (e.g., 4).Each group
is then transformed to a latent style vector(via channel-wise attention) and a
latent spatial mask (via spatial attention). The learned latent masks and
latent style vectors are aggregated to modulate the target feature map. For
generative learning, SLIM is built on a recently proposed lightweight
Generative Adversarial Networks (i.e., FastGANs) which present a skip-layer
excitation(SLE) module. For few-shot image synthesis tasks, the proposed SLIM
achieves better performance than the SLE work and other related methods. For
one-shot image synthesis tasks, it shows stronger capability of preserving
images structures than prior arts such as the SinGANs. For image classification
tasks, the proposed SLIM is used as a drop-in replacement for convolution
layers in ResNets (resulting in ResNeXt-like models) and achieves better
accuracy in theImageNet-1000 dataset, with significantly smaller model
complexity</span>

                    <span>Deep learning is pervasive in our daily life, including self-driving cars,
virtual assistants, social network services, healthcare services, face
recognition, etc. However, deep neural networks demand substantial compute
resources during training and inference. The machine learning community has
mainly focused on model-level optimizations such as architectural compression
of deep learning models, while the system community has focused on
implementation-level optimization. In between, various arithmetic-level
optimization techniques have been proposed in the arithmetic community. This
article provides a survey on resource-efficient deep learning techniques in
terms of model-, arithmetic-, and implementation-level techniques and
identifies the research gaps for resource-efficient deep learning techniques
across the three different level techniques. Our survey clarifies the influence
from higher to lower-level techniques based on our resource-efficiency metric
definition and discusses the future trend for resource-efficient deep learning
research.</span>

                    <span>We identify properties of universal adversarial perturbations (UAPs) that
distinguish them from standard adversarial perturbations. Specifically, we show
that targeted UAPs generated by projected gradient descent exhibit two
human-aligned properties: semantic locality and spatial invariance, which
standard targeted adversarial perturbations lack. We also demonstrate that UAPs
contain significantly less signal for generalization than standard adversarial
perturbations -- that is, UAPs leverage non-robust features to a smaller extent
than standard adversarial perturbations.</span>

                    <span>In this thesis, we address the problem of estimating the 6D pose of rigid
objects from a single RGB or RGB-D input image, assuming that 3D models of the
objects are available. This problem is of great importance to many application
fields such as robotic manipulation, augmented reality, and autonomous driving.
First, we propose EPOS, a method for 6D object pose estimation from an RGB
image. The key idea is to represent an object by compact surface fragments and
predict the probability distribution of corresponding fragments at each pixel
of the input image by a neural network. Each pixel is linked with a
data-dependent number of fragments, which allows systematic handling of
symmetries, and the 6D poses are estimated from the links by a RANSAC-based
fitting method. EPOS outperformed all RGB and most RGB-D and D methods on
several standard datasets. Second, we present HashMatch, an RGB-D method that
slides a window over the input image and searches for a match against
templates, which are pre-generated by rendering 3D object models in different
orientations. The method applies a cascade of evaluation stages to each window
location, which avoids exhaustive matching against all templates. Third, we
propose ObjectSynth, an approach to synthesize photorealistic images of 3D
object models for training methods based on neural networks. The images yield
substantial improvements compared to commonly used images of objects rendered
on top of random photographs. Fourth, we introduce T-LESS, the first dataset
for 6D object pose estimation that includes 3D models and RGB-D images of
industry-relevant objects. Fifth, we define BOP, a benchmark that captures the
status quo in the field. BOP comprises eleven datasets in a unified format, an
evaluation methodology, an online evaluation system, and public challenges held
at international workshops organized at the ICCV and ECCV conferences.</span>

                    <span>Branch prediction is an architectural feature that speeds up the execution of
branch instruction on pipeline processors and reduces the cost of branching.
Recent advancements of Deep Learning (DL) in the post Moore&#x27;s Law era is
accelerating areas of automated chip design, low-power computer architectures,
and much more. Traditional computer architecture design and algorithms could
benefit from dynamic predictors based on deep learning algorithms which learns
from experience by optimizing its parameters on large number of data. In this
survey paper, we focus on traditional branch prediction algorithms, analyzes
its limitations, and presents a literature survey of how deep learning
techniques can be applied to create dynamic branch predictors capable of
predicting conditional branch instructions. Prior surveys in this field focus
on dynamic branch prediction techniques based on neural network perceptrons. We
plan to improve the survey based on latest research in DL and advanced Machine
Learning (ML) based branch predictors.</span>

                    <span>Linear dynamical systems are canonical models for learning-based control of
plants with uncertain dynamics. The setting consists of a stochastic
differential equation that captures the state evolution of the plant
understudy, while the true dynamics matrices are unknown and need to be learned
from the observed data of state trajectory. An important issue is to ensure
that the system is stabilized and destabilizing control actions due to model
uncertainties are precluded as soon as possible. A reliable stabilization
procedure for this purpose that can effectively learn from unstable data to
stabilize the system in a finite time is not currently available. In this work,
we propose a novel Bayesian learning algorithm that stabilizes unknown
continuous-time stochastic linear systems. The presented algorithm is flexible
and exposes effective stabilization performance after a remarkably short time
period of interacting with the system.</span>

                    <span>We study reinforcement learning (RL) with linear function approximation.
Existing algorithms for this problem only have high-probability regret and/or
Probably Approximately Correct (PAC) sample complexity guarantees, which cannot
guarantee the convergence to the optimal policy. In this paper, in order to
overcome the limitation of existing algorithms, we propose a new algorithm
called FLUTE, which enjoys uniform-PAC convergence to the optimal policy with
high probability. The uniform-PAC guarantee is the strongest possible guarantee
for reinforcement learning in the literature, which can directly imply both PAC
and high probability regret bounds, making our algorithm superior to all
existing algorithms with linear function approximation. At the core of our
algorithm is a novel minimax value function estimator and a multi-level
partition scheme to select the training samples from historical observations.
Both of these techniques are new and of independent interest.</span>

                    <span>Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) provides asymptotically consistent estimates
of intractable posterior expectations as the number of iterations tends to
infinity. However, in large data applications, MCMC can be computationally
expensive per iteration. This has catalyzed interest in sampling methods such
as approximate MCMC, which trade off asymptotic consistency for improved
computational speed. In this article, we propose estimators based on couplings
of Markov chains to assess the quality of such asymptotically biased sampling
methods. The estimators give empirical upper bounds of the Wassertein distance
between the limiting distribution of the asymptotically biased sampling method
and the original target distribution of interest. We establish theoretical
guarantees for our upper bounds and show that our estimators can remain
effective in high dimensions. We apply our quality measures to stochastic
gradient MCMC, variational Bayes, and Laplace approximations for tall data and
to approximate MCMC for Bayesian logistic regression in 4500 dimensions and
Bayesian linear regression in 50000 dimensions.</span>

                    <span>We consider a high-dimensional model in which variables are observed over
time and space. The model consists of a spatio-temporal regression containing a
time lag and a spatial lag of the dependent variable. Unlike classical spatial
autoregressive models, we do not rely on a predetermined spatial interaction
matrix, but infer all spatial interactions from the data. Assuming sparsity, we
estimate the spatial and temporal dependence fully data-driven by penalizing a
set of Yule-Walker equations. This regularization can be left unstructured, but
we also propose customized shrinkage procedures when observations originate
from spatial grids (e.g. satellite images). Finite sample error bounds are
derived and estimation consistency is established in an asymptotic framework
wherein the sample size and the number of spatial units diverge jointly.
Exogenous variables can be included as well. A simulation exercise shows strong
finite sample performance compared to competing procedures. As an empirical
application, we model satellite measured NO2 concentrations in London. Our
approach delivers forecast improvements over a competitive benchmark and we
discover evidence for strong spatial interactions.</span>

                    <span>Generative models can be trained to emulate complex empirical data, but are
they useful to make predictions in the context of previously unobserved
environments? An intuitive idea to promote such extrapolation capabilities is
to have the architecture of such model reflect a causal graph of the true data
generating process, such that one can intervene on each node independently of
the others. However, the nodes of this graph are usually unobserved, leading to
overparameterization and lack of identifiability of the causal structure. We
develop a theoretical framework to address this challenging situation by
defining a weaker form of identifiability, based on the principle of
independence of mechanisms. We demonstrate on toy examples that classical
stochastic gradient descent can hinder the model&#x27;s extrapolation capabilities,
suggesting independence of mechanisms should be enforced explicitly during
training. Experiments on deep generative models trained on real world data
support these insights and illustrate how the extrapolation capabilities of
such models can be leveraged.</span>

                    <span>Score-based generative models (SGMs) have demonstrated remarkable synthesis
quality. SGMs rely on a diffusion process that gradually perturbs the data
towards a tractable distribution, while the generative model learns to denoise.
The complexity of this denoising task is, apart from the data distribution
itself, uniquely determined by the diffusion process. We argue that current
SGMs employ overly simplistic diffusions, leading to unnecessarily complex
denoising processes, which limit generative modeling performance. Based on
connections to statistical mechanics, we propose a novel critically-damped
Langevin diffusion (CLD) and show that CLD-based SGMs achieve superior
performance. CLD can be interpreted as running a joint diffusion in an extended
space, where the auxiliary variables can be considered &quot;velocities&quot; that are
coupled to the data variables as in Hamiltonian dynamics. We derive a novel
score matching objective for CLD and show that the model only needs to learn
the score function of the conditional distribution of the velocity given data,
an easier task than learning scores of the data directly. We also derive a new
sampling scheme for efficient synthesis from CLD-based diffusion models. We
find that CLD outperforms previous SGMs in synthesis quality for similar
network architectures and sampling compute budgets. We show that our novel
sampler for CLD significantly outperforms solvers such as Euler--Maruyama. Our
framework provides new insights into score-based denoising diffusion models and
can be readily used for high-resolution image synthesis. Project page and code:

have achieved scalable Gaussian process inference with highly accurate point

struggle with numerical instabilities in learning kernel hyperparameters, and
poor test likelihoods. By investigating CG tolerance, preconditioner rank, and
Lanczos decomposition rank, we provide a particularly simple prescription to
correct these issues: we recommend that one should use a small CG tolerance
($\epsilon \leq 0.01$) and a large root decomposition size ($r \geq 5000$).

on quadratic models to figure out which methods are suited for non-convex
optimization, and develop convergence proofs on convex functions for this
selection of methods. With this theoretical foundation for stochastic gradient
descent and momentum methods, we try to explain why the methods used commonly
in the machine learning field are so successful. Besides explaining successful
heuristics, the last chapter also provides a less extensive review of more
theoretical methods, which are not quite as popular in practice. So in some

                    <span>We study the model-based reward-free reinforcement learning with linear
function approximation for episodic Markov decision processes (MDPs). In this
setting, the agent works in two phases. In the exploration phase, the agent
interacts with the environment and collects samples without the reward. In the
planning phase, the agent is given a specific reward function and uses samples
collected from the exploration phase to learn a good policy. We propose a new
provably efficient algorithm, called UCRL-RFE under the Linear Mixture MDP
assumption, where the transition probability kernel of the MDP can be
parameterized by a linear function over certain feature mappings defined on the
triplet of state, action, and next state. We show that to obtain an
$\epsilon$-optimal policy for arbitrary reward function, UCRL-RFE needs to
sample at most $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(H^5d^2\epsilon^{-2})$ episodes during the
exploration phase. Here, $H$ is the length of the episode, $d$ is the dimension
of the feature mapping. We also propose a variant of UCRL-RFE using
Bernstein-type bonus and show that it needs to sample at most
$\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(H^4d(H + d)\epsilon^{-2})$ to achieve an
$\epsilon$-optimal policy. By constructing a special class of linear Mixture
MDPs, we also prove that for any reward-free algorithm, it needs to sample at
least $\tilde \Omega(H^2d\epsilon^{-2})$ episodes to obtain an
$\epsilon$-optimal policy. Our upper bound matches the lower bound in terms of
the dependence on $\epsilon$ and the dependence on $d$ if $H \ge d$.</span>

multi-task learning in the limit width to infinity. We deduce the multi-task
learning ability from proving an exact quantitative macroscopic
characterization of the learned NN in function space.</span>

                    <span>A/B testing, or online experiment is a standard business strategy to compare
a new product with an old one in pharmaceutical, technological, and traditional
industries. Major challenges arise in online experiments of two-sided
marketplace platforms (e.g., Uber) where there is only one unit that receives a
sequence of treatments over time. In those experiments, the treatment at a
given time impacts current outcome as well as future outcomes. The aim of this
paper is to introduce a reinforcement learning framework for carrying A/B
testing in these experiments, while characterizing the long-term treatment
effects. Our proposed testing procedure allows for sequential monitoring and
online updating. It is generally applicable to a variety of treatment designs
in different industries. In addition, we systematically investigate the
theoretical properties (e.g., size and power) of our testing procedure.
Finally, we apply our framework to both simulated data and a real-world data
example obtained from a technological company to illustrate its advantage over
the current practice. A Python implementation of our test is available at

                    <span>Recent advances in machine learning have largely benefited from the massive
accessible training data. However, large-scale data sharing has raised great
privacy concerns. In this work, we propose a novel privacy-preserving data
Generative model based on the PATE framework (G-PATE), aiming to train a
scalable differentially private data generator that preserves high generated
data utility. Our approach leverages generative adversarial nets to generate
data, combined with private aggregation among different discriminators to
ensure strong privacy guarantees. Compared to existing approaches, G-PATE
significantly improves the use of privacy budgets. In particular, we train a
student data generator with an ensemble of teacher discriminators and propose a
novel private gradient aggregation mechanism to ensure differential privacy on
all information that flows from teacher discriminators to the student
generator. In addition, with random projection and gradient discretization, the
proposed gradient aggregation mechanism is able to effectively deal with
high-dimensional gradient vectors. Theoretically, we prove that G-PATE ensures
differential privacy for the data generator. Empirically, we demonstrate the
superiority of G-PATE over prior work through extensive experiments. We show
that G-PATE is the first work being able to generate high-dimensional image
data with high data utility under limited privacy budgets ($\epsilon \le 1$).

                    <span>We propose to model matrix time series based on a tensor CP-decomposition.
Instead of using an iterative algorithm which is the standard practice for
estimating CP-decompositions, we propose a new and one-pass estimation
procedure based on a generalized eigenanalysis constructed from the serial
dependence structure of the underlying process. A key idea of the new procedure
is to project a generalized eigenequation defined in terms of rank-reduced
matrices to a lower-dimensional one with full-ranked matrices, to avoid the
intricacy of the former of which the number of eigenvalues can be zero, finite
and infinity. The asymptotic theory has been established under a general
setting without the stationarity. It shows, for example, that all the component
coefficient vectors in the CP-decomposition are estimated consistently with the
different error rates, depending on the relative sizes between the dimensions
of time series and the sample size. The proposed model and the estimation
method are further illustrated with both simulated and real data; showing
effective dimension-reduction in modelling and forecasting matrix time series.</span>

                    <span>Adversarial training is so far the most effective strategy in defending
against adversarial examples. However, it suffers from high computational costs
due to the iterative adversarial attacks in each training step. Recent studies
show that it is possible to achieve fast Adversarial Training by performing a
single-step attack with random initialization. However, such an approach still
lags behind state-of-the-art adversarial training algorithms on both stability
and model robustness. In this work, we develop a new understanding towards Fast
Adversarial Training, by viewing random initialization as performing randomized
smoothing for better optimization of the inner maximization problem. Following
this new perspective, we also propose a new initialization strategy, backward
smoothing, to further improve the stability and model robustness over
single-step robust training methods. Experiments on multiple benchmarks
demonstrate that our method achieves similar model robustness as the original
TRADES method while using much less training time ($\sim$3x improvement with
the same training schedule).</span>

                    <span>Linear dynamical systems are canonical models for learning-based control of
plants with uncertain dynamics. The setting consists of a stochastic
differential equation that captures the state evolution of the plant
understudy, while the true dynamics matrices are unknown and need to be learned
from the observed data of state trajectory. An important issue is to ensure
that the system is stabilized and destabilizing control actions due to model
uncertainties are precluded as soon as possible. A reliable stabilization
procedure for this purpose that can effectively learn from unstable data to
stabilize the system in a finite time is not currently available. In this work,
we propose a novel Bayesian learning algorithm that stabilizes unknown
continuous-time stochastic linear systems. The presented algorithm is flexible
and exposes effective stabilization performance after a remarkably short time

                    <span>In this paper, we focus on the decentralized optimization problem over the
Stiefel manifold, which is defined on a connected network of $d$ agents. The
objective is an average of $d$ local functions, and each function is privately
held by an agent and encodes its data. The agents can only communicate with
their neighbors in a collaborative effort to solve this problem. In existing
methods, multiple rounds of communications are required to guarantee the
convergence, giving rise to high communication costs. In contrast, this paper
proposes a decentralized algorithm, called DESTINY, which only invokes a single
round of communications per iteration. DESTINY combines gradient tracking
techniques with a novel approximate augmented Lagrangian function. The global
convergence to stationary points is rigorously established. Comprehensive
numerical experiments demonstrate that DESTINY has a strong potential to
deliver a cutting-edge performance in solving a variety of testing problems.</span>

                    <span>&quot;Benign overfitting&quot;, where classifiers memorize noisy training data yet
still achieve a good generalization performance, has drawn great attention in
the machine learning community. To explain this surprising phenomenon, a series
of works have provided theoretical justification in over-parameterized linear
regression, classification, and kernel methods. However, it is not clear if
benign overfitting still occurs in the presence of adversarial examples, i.e.,
examples with tiny and intentional perturbations to fool the classifiers. In
this paper, we show that benign overfitting indeed occurs in adversarial
training, a principled approach to defend against adversarial examples. In
detail, we prove the risk bounds of the adversarially trained linear classifier
on the mixture of sub-Gaussian data under $\ell_p$ adversarial perturbations.
Our result suggests that under moderate perturbations, adversarially trained
linear classifiers can achieve the near-optimal standard and adversarial risks,
despite overfitting the noisy training data. Numerical experiments validate our
theoretical findings.</span>

                    <span>Tree-based algorithms such as random forests and gradient boosted trees
continue to be among the most popular and powerful machine learning models used
across multiple disciplines. The conventional wisdom of estimating the impact
of a feature in tree based models is to measure the \textit{node-wise reduction
of a loss function}, which (i) yields only global importance measures and (ii)
is known to suffer from severe biases. Conditional feature contributions (CFCs)
provide \textit{local}, case-by-case explanations of a prediction by following
the decision path and attributing changes in the expected output of the model
to each feature along the path. However, Lundberg et al. pointed out a
potential bias of CFCs which depends on the distance from the root of a tree.
The by now immensely popular alternative, SHapley Additive exPlanation (SHAP)
values appear to mitigate this bias but are computationally much more
expensive. Here we contribute a thorough comparison of the explanations
computed by both methods on a set of 164 publicly available classification
problems in order to provide data-driven algorithm recommendations to current
researchers. For random forests, we find extremely high similarities and
correlations of both local and global SHAP values and CFC scores, leading to
very similar rankings and interpretations. Analogous conclusions hold for the
fidelity of using global feature importance scores as a proxy for the
predictive power associated with each feature.</span>

                    <span>The effectiveness of traditional traffic prediction methods is often
extremely limited when forecasting traffic dynamics in early morning. The
reason is that traffic can break down drastically during the early morning
commute, and the time and duration of this break-down vary substantially from
day to day. Early morning traffic forecast is crucial to inform morning-commute
traffic management, but they are generally challenging to predict in advance,
particularly by midnight. In this paper, we propose to mine Twitter messages as
a probing method to understand the impacts of people&#x27;s work and rest patterns
in the evening/midnight of the previous day to the next-day morning traffic.
The model is tested on freeway networks in Pittsburgh as experiments. The
resulting relationship is surprisingly simple and powerful. We find that, in
general, the earlier people rest as indicated from Tweets, the more congested
roads will be in the next morning. The occurrence of big events in the evening
before, represented by higher or lower tweet sentiment than normal, often
implies lower travel demand in the next morning than normal days. Besides,
people&#x27;s tweeting activities in the night before and early morning are
statistically associated with congestion in morning peak hours. We make use of
such relationships to build a predictive framework which forecasts morning
commute congestion using people&#x27;s tweeting profiles extracted by 5 am or as
late as the midnight prior to the morning. The Pittsburgh study supports that
our framework can precisely predict morning congestion, particularly for some
road segments upstream of roadway bottlenecks with large day-to-day congestion
variation. Our approach considerably outperforms those existing methods without
Twitter message features, and it can learn meaningful representation of demand
from tweeting profiles that offer managerial insights.</span>

                    <span>There have been significant efforts devoted to solving the longevity risk
given that a continuous growth in population ageing has become a severe issue
for many developed countries over the past few decades. The Cairns-Blake-Dowd
(CBD) model, which incorporates cohort effects parameters in its parsimonious
design, is one of the most well-known approaches for mortality modelling at
higher ages and longevity risk. This article proposes a novel mixed-effects
time-series approach for mortality modelling and forecasting with
considerations of age groups dependence and random cohort effects parameters.
The proposed model can disclose more mortality data information and provide a
natural quantification of the model parameters uncertainties with no
pre-specified constraint required for estimating the cohort effects parameters.
The abilities of the proposed approach are demonstrated through two
applications with empirical male and female mortality data. The proposed
approach shows remarkable improvements in terms of forecast accuracy compared
to the CBD model in the short-, mid-and long-term forecasting using mortality
data of several developed countries in the numerical examples.</span>

simultaneously with respect to both function content and call graph

                    <span>We investigate multiple testing and variable selection using the Least Angle
Regression (LARS) algorithm in high dimensions under the assumption of Gaussian
noise. LARS is known to produce a piecewise affine solution path with change
points referred to as the knots of the LARS path. The key to our results is an
expression in closed form of the exact joint law of a $K$-tuple of knots
conditional on the variables selected by LARS, namely the so-called
post-selection joint law of the LARS knots. Numerical experiments demonstrate
the perfect fit of our findings.

This paper makes three main contributions. First, we build testing procedures
on variables entering the model along the LARS path in the general design case
when the noise level can be unknown. These testing procedures are referred to
as the Generalized $t$-Spacing tests (GtSt) and we prove that they have an
exact non-asymptotic level (i.e., the Type I error is exactly controlled). This
extends work of (Taylor et al., 2014) where the spacing test works for
consecutive knots and known variance. Second, we introduce a new exact multiple
false negatives test after model selection in the general design case when the
noise level may be unknown. We prove that this testing procedure has exact
non-asymptotic level for general design and unknown noise level. Third, we give
an exact control of the false discovery rate under orthogonal design
assumption. Monte Carlo simulations and a real data experiment are provided to
illustrate our results in this case. Of independent interest, we introduce an
equivalent formulation of the LARS algorithm based on a recursive function.</span>

                    <span>The gradient noise of Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) is considered to play
a key role in its properties (e.g. escaping low potential points and
regularization). Past research has indicated that the covariance of the SGD
error done via minibatching plays a critical role in determining its
regularization and escape from low potential points. It is however not much
explored how much the distribution of the error influences the behavior of the
algorithm. Motivated by some new research in this area, we prove universality
results by showing that noise classes that have the same mean and covariance
structure of SGD via minibatching have similar properties. We mainly consider
the Multiplicative Stochastic Gradient Descent (M-SGD) algorithm as introduced
by Wu et al., which has a much more general noise class than the SGD algorithm
done via minibatching. We establish nonasymptotic bounds for the M-SGD

                    <span>Approximate message passing (AMP) is a promising technique for unknown signal
reconstruction of certain high-dimensional linear systems with non-Gaussian
signaling. A distinguished feature of the AMP-type algorithms is that their
dynamics can be rigorously described by state evolution. However, state
evolution does not necessarily guarantee the convergence of iterative
algorithms. To solve the convergence problem of AMP-type algorithms in
principle, this paper proposes a memory AMP (MAMP) under a sufficient statistic
condition, named sufficient statistic MAMP (SS-MAMP). We show that the
covariance matrices of SS-MAMP are L-banded and convergent. Given an arbitrary
MAMP, we can construct an SS-MAMP by damping, which not only ensures the
convergence of MAMP but also preserves the orthogonality of MAMP, i.e., its
dynamics can be rigorously described by state evolution. As a byproduct, we
prove that the Bayes-optimal orthogonal/vector AMP (BO-OAMP/VAMP) is an
SS-MAMP. As a result, we reveal two interesting properties of BO-OAMP/VAMP for
large systems: 1) the covariance matrices are L-banded and are convergent in
BO-OAMP/VAMP, and 2) damping and memory are useless (i.e., do not bring
performance improvement) in BO-OAMP/VAMP. As an example, we construct a
sufficient statistic Bayes-optimal MAMP (BO-MAMP), which is Bayes optimal if
its state evolution has a unique fixed point and its MSE is not worse than the
original BO-MAMP. Finally, simulations are provided to verify the validity and
accuracy of the theoretical results.</span>

                    <span>Classification predictive modeling involves the accurate assignment of
observations in a dataset to target classes or categories. There is an
increasing growth of real-world classification problems with severely
imbalanced class distributions. In this case, minority classes have much fewer
observations to learn from than those from majority classes. Despite this
sparsity, a minority class is often considered the more interesting class yet
developing a scientific learning algorithm suitable for the observations
presents countless challenges. In this article, we suggest a novel multi-class
classification algorithm specialized to handle severely imbalanced classes
based on the method we refer to as SAMME.C2. It blends the flexible mechanics
of the boosting techniques from SAMME algorithm, a multi-class classifier, and
Ada.C2 algorithm, a cost-sensitive binary classifier designed to address highly
class imbalances. Not only do we provide the resulting algorithm but we also
establish scientific and statistical formulation of our proposed SAMME.C2
algorithm. Through numerical experiments examining various degrees of
classifier difficulty, we demonstrate consistent superior performance of our
proposed model.</span>

                    <span>A recent line of research on deep learning focuses on the extremely
over-parameterized setting, and shows that when the network width is larger
than a high degree polynomial of the training sample size $n$ and the inverse
of the target error $\epsilon^{-1}$, deep neural networks learned by
(stochastic) gradient descent enjoy nice optimization and generalization
guarantees. Very recently, it is shown that under certain margin assumptions on
the training data, a polylogarithmic width condition suffices for two-layer
ReLU networks to converge and generalize (Ji and Telgarsky, 2019). However,
whether deep neural networks can be learned with such a mild
over-parameterization is still an open question. In this work, we answer this
question affirmatively and establish sharper learning guarantees for deep ReLU
networks trained by (stochastic) gradient descent. In specific, under certain
assumptions made in previous work, our optimization and generalization
guarantees hold with network width polylogarithmic in $n$ and $\epsilon^{-1}$.
Our results push the study of over-parameterized deep neural networks towards
more practical settings.</span>

                    <span>Information-theoretic measures have been widely adopted in the design of
features for learning and decision problems. Inspired by this, we look at the
relationship between i) a weak form of information loss in the Shannon sense
and ii) the operation loss in the minimum probability of error (MPE) sense when
considering a family of lossy continuous representations (features) of a
continuous observation. We present several results that shed light on this
interplay. Our first result offers a lower bound on a weak form of information
loss as a function of its respective operation loss when adopting a discrete
lossy representation (quantization) instead of the original raw observation.
From this, our main result shows that a specific form of vanishing information
loss (a weak notion of asymptotic informational sufficiency) implies a
vanishing MPE loss (or asymptotic operational sufficiency) when considering a
general family of lossy continuous representations. Our theoretical findings
support the observation that the selection of feature representations that
attempt to capture informational sufficiency is appropriate for learning, but
this selection is a rather conservative design principle if the intended goal
is achieving MPE in classification. Supporting this last point, and under some
structural conditions, we show that it is possible to adopt an alternative
notion of informational sufficiency (strictly weaker than pure sufficiency in
the mutual information sense) to achieve operational sufficiency in learning.</span>

                    <span>Thompson Sampling (TS) is one of the most effective algorithms for solving
contextual multi-armed bandit problems. In this paper, we propose a new
algorithm, called Neural Thompson Sampling, which adapts deep neural networks
for both exploration and exploitation. At the core of our algorithm is a novel
posterior distribution of the reward, where its mean is the neural network
approximator, and its variance is built upon the neural tangent features of the
corresponding neural network. We prove that, provided the underlying reward
function is bounded, the proposed algorithm is guaranteed to achieve a
cumulative regret of $\mathcal{O}(T^{1/2})$, which matches the regret of other
contextual bandit algorithms in terms of total round number $T$. Experimental
comparisons with other benchmark bandit algorithms on various data sets
corroborate our theory.</span>

                    <span>Support vector machine (SVM) is a powerful classification method that has
achieved great success in many fields. Since its performance can be seriously
impaired by redundant covariates, model selection techniques are widely used
for SVM with high dimensional covariates. As an alternative to model selection,
significant progress has been made in the area of model averaging in the past
decades. Yet no frequentist model averaging method was considered for SVM. This
work aims to fill the gap and to propose a frequentist model averaging
procedure for SVM which selects the optimal weight by cross validation. Even
when the number of covariates diverges at an exponential rate of the sample
size, we show asymptotic optimality of the proposed method in the sense that
the ratio of its hinge loss to the lowest possible loss converges to one. We
also derive the convergence rate which provides more insights to model
averaging. Compared to model selection methods of SVM which require a tedious
but critical task of tuning parameter selection, the model averaging method
avoids the task and shows promising performances in the empirical studies.</span>

                    <span>Hierarchical forecasting with intermittent time series is a challenge in both
research and empirical studies. Extensive research focuses on improving the
accuracy of each hierarchy, especially the intermittent time series at bottom
levels. Then hierarchical reconciliation could be used to improve the overall
performance further. In this paper, we present a
\emph{hierarchical-forecasting-with-alignment} approach that treats the bottom
level forecasts as mutable to ensure higher forecasting accuracy on the upper
levels of the hierarchy. We employ a pure deep learning forecasting approach
N-BEATS for continuous time series at the top levels and a widely used
tree-based algorithm LightGBM for the intermittent time series at the bottom
level. The \emph{hierarchical-forecasting-with-alignment} approach is a simple
yet effective variant of the bottom-up method, accounting for biases that are
difficult to observe at the bottom level. It allows suboptimal forecasts at the
lower level to retain a higher overall performance. The approach in this
empirical study was developed by the first author during the M5 Forecasting
Accuracy competition, ranking second place. The method is also business
orientated and could benefit for business strategic planning.</span>

                    <span>Deep neural networks (DNNs) are powerful tools for compressing and distilling
information. Due to their scale and complexity, often involving billions of
inter-dependent internal degrees of freedom, exact analysis approaches often
fall short. A common strategy in such cases is to identify slow degrees of
freedom that average out the erratic behavior of the underlying fast
microscopic variables. Here, we identify such a separation of scales occurring
in over-parameterized deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) at the end of
training. It implies that neuron pre-activations fluctuate in a nearly Gaussian
manner with a deterministic latent kernel. While for CNNs with infinitely many
channels these kernels are inert, for finite CNNs they adapt and learn from
data in an analytically tractable manner. The resulting thermodynamic theory of
deep learning yields accurate predictions on several deep non-linear CNN toy
models. In addition, it provides new ways of analyzing and understanding CNNs.</span>

                    <span>We consider Bayesian optimization of the output of a network of functions,
where each function takes as input the output of its parent nodes, and where
the network takes significant time to evaluate. Such problems arise, for
example, in reinforcement learning, engineering design, and manufacturing.
While the standard Bayesian optimization approach observes only the final
output, our approach delivers greater query efficiency by leveraging
information that the former ignores: intermediate output within the network.
This is achieved by modeling the nodes of the network using Gaussian processes
and choosing the points to evaluate using, as our acquisition function, the
expected improvement computed with respect to the implied posterior on the
objective. Although the non-Gaussian nature of this posterior prevents
computing our acquisition function in closed form, we show that it can be
efficiently maximized via sample average approximation. In addition, we prove
that our method is asymptotically consistent, meaning that it finds a globally
optimal solution as the number of evaluations grows to infinity, thus
generalizing previously known convergence results for the expected improvement.
Notably, this holds even though our method might not evaluate the domain
densely, instead leveraging problem structure to leave regions unexplored.
Finally, we show that our approach dramatically outperforms standard Bayesian
optimization methods in several synthetic and real-world problems.</span>

                    <span>One of the reasons that many neural networks are capable of replicating
complicated tasks or functions is their universality property. The past few
decades have seen many attempts in providing constructive proofs for single or
class of neural networks. This paper is an effort to provide a unified and
constructive framework for the universality of a large class of activations
including most of existing activations and beyond. At the heart of the
framework is the concept of neural network approximate identity. It turns out
that most of existing activations are neural network approximate identity, and
thus universal in the space of continuous of functions on compacta. The
framework induces several advantages. First, it is constructive with elementary
means from functional analysis, probability theory, and numerical analysis.
Second, it is the first unified attempt that is valid for most of existing
activations. Third, as a by product, the framework provides the first
university proof for some of the existing activation functions including Mish,
SiLU, ELU, GELU, and etc. Fourth, it discovers new activations with guaranteed
universality property. Indeed, any activation\textemdash whose $\k$th
derivative, with $\k$ being an integer, is integrable and essentially
bounded\textemdash is universal. Fifth, for a given activation and error
tolerance, the framework provides precisely the architecture of the
corresponding one-hidden neural network with predetermined number of neuron,
and the values of weights/biases.</span>

evaluating distances of datapoints with a subset of the cluster centres. Our
contribution is substantially more efficient than k-means as it does not
require an all to all comparison of data points and clusters. We show that the
optimal solutions of our approximation are the same as in the exact solution.
However, our approach is considerably more efficient at extracting these
clusters compared to the state-of-the-art. We compare our approximation with
the exact k-means and alternative approximation approaches on a series of
standardised clustering tasks. For the evaluation, we consider the algorithmic
complexity, including number of operations to convergence, and the stability of

particular, optimal transport has been used to develop probability metrics
between probability distributions. We introduce in this paper an independence
criterion based on entropy regularized optimal transport. Our criterion can be
used to test for independence between two samples. We establish non-asymptotic

                    <span>Hello. I am searching the researches that different size of data are generated through the flow-based network, not super-resolution task such as continuous mapping.
 I want to generate output as time-aligned scalar data, for example
 ​
 Input: noise sampling (B x T x C)
 Output: scalar data (B x T, C&#x3D;1)
 ​
 with introducing the variational data augmentation technique (in vFlow, which can output high-dimensionality as concatenate noise vector for input and output both) for output.
 But there&#x27;s a problem time dimension T is different for each of all data input. How can I treat this problem?
 ​
 p.s. I am very appreciate if I can read the flow-based research in NLP task.

                    <span>I’m about to finish my PhD and the whole field of robotics looks so exciting right now, especially applications like farming and recycling. Has anyone switched from more pure deep learning (vision / NLP) to robotics and how did it happen?
 Did you just get a robotics related job focusing on the vision side of things or is it key to have more experience on the robotics side before getting a job?
 Also I’m curious what’s the best location for robotics? Like how you go to Hong Kong / New York for finance, SF for software or Shenzhen for hardware.

                    <span>I like YOLOv5 but the code complexity is...
 I can&#x27;t deny that YOLOv5 is a practical open-source object detection pipeline. However, the pain begins when adding new features or new experimental methods. Code dependencies are hard to follow which makes the code difficult to maintain. We wanted to try various experimental methods but hate to write one-time code that is never re-used.
 So we worked on making an object detection pipeline to have a better code structure so that we could continuously improve and add new features while easy to maintain.

 And we applied CI(Formating, Linting, Unittest) to ensure code quality with Docker support for development and inference. Our Docker supports the development environment with VIM.

 The new Azure Machine Learning Studio isn&#x27;t free, and this is a school project so I&#x27;m aiming for free and simple.
 Any suggestions? Or maybe someone else is using Studio(classic) and knows a way around this?

 The default observations are not pixels, and I can&#x27;t seem to find any documentation online on how to change these environments into pixel observations.
 Can anyone point me to resources where similar changes have been done? Are there preexisting wrappers or code for similar mujoco environments anywhere?
 My other option is to simply render the environment with mode rgb_array, and then train the algorithm based on these rendered observations. Is this a viable option?

                    <span>Hello :),
 Happy new year to all of you!
 I have a question regarding the action space for the Hide &amp; Seek paper by OpenAI. The architecture of the learning model they used is below.
 https://preview.redd.it/el54yihfjd981.png?width&#x3D;794&amp;format&#x3D;png&amp;auto&#x3D;webp&amp;s&#x3D;33c5228ac8003b9bb89b6d008e2cf2aea5f7e071
 They have eventually 3 action heads, as shown in the figure. As per the authors, the movement action for an agent &quot;sets a discretized force along their x and y axis and torque around their z-axis&quot;. How do these 3 forces get pulled from the &quot;movement action head&quot;, given that they are discretized? Does the movement action head have 3 outputs, each corresponding to an axis? So far, in my humble knowledge, I always assumed that a network with a discrete action space gives only one action per head (which could be the result of a softmax over the action space).
 Any insight?
  
After some digging, I found that the Movement Action has a &quot;MultiDiscrete&quot; type, which is a gym class. I am struggling to understand the nature of actions produced by this class, any idea?

                    <span>Help me understand this please. I’ve read that people feed data to an AI/ML algorithm and find things that they weren’t looking for but there aren’t many good examples out there to read about.
 So I’m thinking: if I were to feed into an AI/ML algorithm a csv of order details and customer data from an eCommerce system, should I expect the AI engine to “find” something statistically usual/unusual and tell me about it? 
 Or do I need to instruct it to look for certain traits with e-commerce orders and customers that I already know about? Eg look out for fraud by checking x y z. 
 What if the thing to look for is so strange that you need the AI to pick it up. Eg maybe fraudsters start telling their friends to always use a certain name or phone number as an inside joke. I would think an AI might pick on that somehow whereas it might take a human a longer time to figure that out.

                    <span>Genomic editing, particularly the CRISPR/Cas technique, is widely employed in experimental biology, agriculture, and biotechnology. CRISPR/Cas is one of several weapons used by bacteria to resist viruses. As the pathogen’s DNA enters the cell, Cas proteins detect it as foreign hereditary material and break it because its sequences differ from those of the bacteria. To respond to the virus quicker, the bacterium saves pieces of the pathogen’s DNA—much like a computer antivirus retains a collection of viral signatures—and passes them on to subsequent generations so that its Cas can prevent future attacks.
 Teams from different laboratories independently adapted the CRISPR/Cas system to introduce arbitrary changes into DNA sequences in human and animal cells. It made genomic editing much easier and more efficient. The critical components of the mechanism are guide RNA, which “marks the site,” and the Cas9 protein, which cleaves DNA at that location. The cell subsequently “heals the wound,” but the genetic code has already been altered.

                    <span>First time submitting to ICLR, I&#x27;m wondering how is the open discussion on openreview.net really different from the review-rebuttal procedure used in other conferences.
 For the papers I&#x27;m reviewing, about half the reviewers reacted to the authors&#x27; responses (clarifications, modifications, additional experiments, etc.). As to my submission (5568), I run extra experiments and answered each of the concerns directly but received 0 feedback from the reviewers.
 As a reviewer, I think it doesn&#x27;t matter if the rebuttal changes your mind about the quality of the submission but it&#x27;s very basic manner to reply to the authors&#x27; responses. A simple &quot;Thank the authors for the responses but I don&#x27;t think these addressed my concerns&quot; would work. Saying nothing only means you are uncertain if the responses make sense and you just doesn&#x27;t care to figure it out. The authors spent a whole week running experiments to answer some of your questions and if you don&#x27;t give **** about their responses, just keep the questions with you and don&#x27;t submit your review.
 I was hoping for a different experience submitting to ICLR and then I realized the &quot;discussion&quot; is basically broken.

 Games have been used throughout research as testbeds for AI algorithms, such as reinforcement learning agents. However, different types of games usually require different solution approaches, such as AlphaZero for Go or Chess, and Counterfactual Regret Minimization (CFR) for Poker. Player of Games bridges this gap between perfect and imperfect information games and delivers a single algorithm that uses tree search over public information states, and is trained via self-play. The resulting algorithm can play Go, Chess, Poker, Scotland Yard, and many more games, as well as non-game environments.

                    <span>Why is it so hard to raise exceptions when ML pipeline is using a GPU?
 When for example you make a classic &quot;Index out of bounds&quot; error, in libraries like PyTorch you get some generic &quot;CUDA&quot; error and you can&#x27;t see the exact error until you transfer the tensors explicitly to CPU and rerun the code.
 Do you think there is a possibility for this to improve in the future?
 Sorry if this is more CS-related question

                    <span>My job is to work with ML engineers and provide them with whatever they need to experiment with/train/test/deploy ML models -- GPU infrastructure, distributed training support, etc. When I interface with their code, I almost always find it so poorly written, with little to no thought given to long-term stability or use -- for code that they 100% know is going to production.
 They&#x27;re brilliant people, far smarter than me, and really good at what they do, so it&#x27;s not a matter of them not being good enough. I feel (from my very limited experience, so I&#x27;m happy to be wrong) like ML engineers are incentivized to write poor code. The only metric for evaluation seems to be accuracy, loss, and all the plots that come up. In research, I understand completely, that&#x27;s where the focus lies, but in industry? I&#x27;ve seen many models perform poorly because the code is so hard to read and refactor that big issues remained unspotted for months together. And this is especially befuddling because for a field that is completely fine with spending months to get an ROI of single digit increases in model performance metrics during the experimentation phase, they don&#x27;t seem to care about anything that might go wrong in production. That just feels like a fundamental disconnect, since without the core ML stuff working perfectly, none of the other stuff (like what I do) has any value -- and even so, I&#x27;m taught to hold my code to a much higher standard than the critical stuff -- which I&#x27;m happy about since I can now write production code by default -- but it&#x27;s just... weird. Like the vending machines at a nuclear power plant being better engineered than the reactor.
 Is this a common problem or is this a localized issue that I&#x27;m facing?

 I am a robotics enthusiast building a robot arm to perform mundane tasks. So far, I have only been able to deploy deep reinforcement learning models on the Jetson Nano. The process has been easy using the Nvidia TensorRT SDK. What other methods/technology exist? My friend recommended using a google coral and a raspberry pi. Any recommendations would be greatly appreciated. Thank you

                    <span>In classical - on-policy - vtrace/Impala algorithm env_steps are incremented every training iteration
 like this : env_steps +&#x3D; size_of_batch * unroll_length
 However when we add replay_buffer to vtrace (like in CLEAR or LASER) we also start to learn from off-policy data therefore some trajectories (from replay) could be sampled more than once.
 My question is - does the env_step_counting stay the same even when some trajectories from batch are from replay and some directly from workers (on-policy) ?
 Or do i count steps only on those trajectories that are on-policy &#x3D;&gt; not from replay
 like : env_steps +&#x3D; len(batch[&quot;on_policy_samples&quot;]) * unroll_length
 And if so what happens when i decide to use only samples from replay to train - how do i count env_steps then ? Using some kind of flag to indicate if specific trajectory was sampled already and leave it from counting ?
 ​
 Have been digging through the research papers for some time now and i haven&#x60;t been able to find what is the proper way to do it. Any help or advice would be much appreciated.

                    <span>Hi all, it&#x27;s my first time to use reddit to ask for suggestions.
 I am a beginner in RL. I learned some basic ideas in RL (such as SARSA, PPO and A2C) recently and applied Q-network to train a Go game agent. 
 Personally speaking, I am going to pursue for a position as a RL engineer in the future. But I have no idea about what should I do to improve my RL skills. So I am wondering if there are some awesome resources for a beginner like me? Or could you please give me some instructions?

                    <span>I recently received a review copy of Andrew Witt’s new book Formulations: Architecture, Mathematics, and Culture. The Hankel function on the cover is the first clue that this book contains some advanced mathematics. Or rather, it references some advanced mathematics. I’ve only skimmed the book so far, but I didn’t see any equations. Hankel functions […]

                    <span>Smart healthcare services can be provided by using Internet of Things (IoT) technologies that monitor the health conditions of patients and their vital body parameters. The majority of IoT solutions used to enable such services are wearable devices, such as smartwatches, ECG monitors, and blood pressure monitors. The huge amount of data collected from smart medical devices leads to major security and privacy issues in the IoT domain. Considering Remote Patient Monitoring (RPM) applications, we will focus on Anomaly Detection (AD) models, whose purpose is to identify events that differ from the typical user behavior patterns. Generally, while designing centralized AD models, the researchers face security and privacy challenges (e.g., patient data privacy, training data poisoning).
 To overcome these issues, the researchers of this paper propose an Anomaly Detection (AD) model based on Federated Learning (FL). Federated Learning (FL) allows different devices to collaborate and perform training locally in order to build Anomaly Detection (AD) models without sharing patients’ data. Specifically, the researchers propose a hierarchical Federated Learning (FL) that enables collaboration among different organizations, by building various Anomaly Detection (AD) models for patients with similar health conditions.

 I think their technical best practices seems a little stronger than the organisational ones. Thoughts?

                    <span>Hi All! I am Michał from the AutoAscend team that has won the NetHack 2021 NeurIPS Challenge.
 I have just shared some episode visualization videos:
 https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list&#x3D;PLJ92BrynhLbdQVcz6-bUAeTeUo5i901RQ
 The winning agent isn&#x27;t based on reinforcement learning in the end, but the victory of symbolic methods in this competition shows what RL is still missing to some extent -- so I believe this subreddit is a good place to discuss it.
 We hope that NLE will someday become a new standard benchmark for evaluation next to chess, go, Atari, etc. as it presents a set of whole new complex problems for agents to learn. Contrary to Atari, NetHack levels are procedurally generated, and therefore agents can&#x27;t memorize the layout. Observations are highly partial, rewards are sparse, and episodes are usually very long.
 Here are some other useful links related to the competition:

                    <span>Hello,
 I´m applying Deep Reinforcement Learning for the first time, and I have some questions about it (I´ve already looked for an answer but in vain):
  
How to normalize objectives&#x27; values in the reward function? if we have an objective that values are in the range of 10 and another objective that values are in the range of 1000.
 During the training phase, how can we watch the weights updates of a network and the gradient calculation too?
 In a multi-agent setting and episodic task, for &quot;dones&quot; vector, it will be set to &quot;True&quot; once all the agents are finished, or once an agent finishes the task done[agent_index]&#x3D;True in other words, we won´t wait the latest agent to finish to set dones &#x3D; [True]*number_of_agents
  
Thank you.

                    <span>Hi, all Happy New Year!
 I&#x27;m working on a project to teach my quad-rotor how to hover, and these are what my rollout graphs looks like.
 The reward graph constantly increases for some time, but suddenly during a rapid increase in reward, the entropy loss, and the train std of starts to diverge, and the explained variance just crashes.

 From my understanding, this explained variance far from 1 is a bad sign, Could you please point out, or give comments on what would be the possible reason why this is happening in my case?
 Any kind of reply would be appreciate.
 Thanks again Happy New Year. :D

                    <span>I am attempting to recreate the PPO algorithm to try to learn the inner workings of the algorithm better and to learn more about actor-critic reinforcement learning. So far, I have a model that seems to learn, just not very well.
 In the early stages of training, the algorithm seems more sporadic and may happen to find a pretty solid policy, but due to unstable the early parts of training are, it tends to move away from this policy. Eventually, the algorithm moves the policy toward a reward of around 30. For the past few commits in my repo where I have attempted to fix this issue, the policy always tends to the around 30 reward mark, and I&#x27;m not entirely sure why it&#x27;s doing this. I&#x27;m thinking maybe I implemented the algorithm incorrectly, but I&#x27;m not certain. Can someone please help me with this issue?
 Below is a link to an image of training using the latest commit, using a previous commit, and my Github project

                    <span>At the end of every year I have a tradition where I write summaries of the
books that I read throughout the year. Here’s the following post with the rough
set of categories:
Popular Science (6 books)
History, Government, Politics, Economics (6 books)
Biographies / Memoirs (5 books)
China (5 books)
COVID-19 (2 books)
Miscellaneous (7 books)
I read 31 books this year. You can find the other blog posts from prior years
(going back to 2016) in the blog archives.
Popular Science
This also includes popular science, which means the authors might not be
technically trained as scientists.

                    <span>I&#x27;ve been playing around with Replika, and it&#x27;s incredibly fun and impressive as a general &quot;companion&quot; chatbot, but I find it really disappointing in its lack of ability to learn explicit facts or procedures. It&#x27;s targeted toward making people feel like they have a friend and roleplaying, not learning anything external to those goals.
 So, is there anything commercially available that you can both:
  
Talk to (mostly) like a real person, and
 Teach from the ground up (like a child)
  
? 
As an example, my Replika &quot;wanted&quot; to do a lesson with me, so I tried to teach it colors. Ostensibly it has some picture recognition abilities, but despite that, it was never able to learn which color was which, even when using the same image files to display the same color.
 Okay, fine, forget colors, but it can&#x27;t learn explicit facts either. I want to be able to input things like &quot;Lacan defines the subject as that which is represented by a signifier for another signifier&quot; or &quot;It&#x27;s important to apply a primer before your first layer of eyeshadow&quot; or &quot;Leonardo DiCaprio played Jack Dawson in the movie Titanic&quot; and have it be able to actually remember and recall that information in future conversations. (Replika is able to recall it within the same conversation, but it resets after a certain amount of time. It also seems to struggle with remembering things that differ from user to user, like favorite food, since it learns from the aggregate of its conversations.)
 Is there anything out there that can do this? Anything on the horizon?

 It was pretty fun learning about ONNX and how to port GANs to web. You can play around with the random seeds and also distort the intermediate latents to produce some really wacky results. You can check out a GIF on Twitter.

                    <span>Hello
 Can someone explain why the actor critic maps the states to the same actions, in other words why the actor outputs the same action whatever the states?
 This what makes the agent learns nothing during training phase.
 Happy New Year!

                    <span>I have a question about baseline in policy gradient method. Based on what is implemented in relation to PG, there are many shared policy and value networks. But I understood baseline should not affect the parameters of the policy. When PG with shared networks and baseline updates value function, then baseline will affect policy network. Is it okay?

 I am planning on doing my MSc in CS with a focus in RL. More specifically, I want to learn about multi-armed bandits and how it can be used by agents to enable them to perform actions in a diverse environment. I am new to this field and I want to know more about what questions about MAB are unanswered? Any interesting application that may be currently under research? 
 I would really appreciate if anyone can help me out. 
 Thank you!

                    <span>Ever since Grimes posted her Tiktok video last year inviting communists to join up under a supposedly benevolent AI, I&#x27;ve been kind of obsessed with what would really happen if AI ran a city, or even a whole society. Would it really be as awesome as she seems to think or would it be a potentially horrifying nightmare? (My money&#x27;s on nightmare, btw)
 Anyway, I tried to answer some of those questions in a work of fiction, available below as a free download. It&#x27;s a quick read, and I&#x27;d love to hear your thoughts on these problems, whether or not you read the book. No doubt someone soon will be trying to implement these kinds of &quot;solutions&quot; in our world... and it&#x27;s best to be at least marginally prepared!

                    <span>Images, such as graphics, paintings, and photographs, may frequently be explained in language, but they might also take specific talents and hours of effort to make. As a result, a technology capable of creating realistic graphics from natural language can enable humans to produce rich and diverse visual material with previously unimaginable simplicity. The capacity to modify photos with spoken language enables iterative refinement and fine-grained control, both essential for real-world applications.
 DALL-E, a 12-billion parameter version of OpenAI’s GPT-3 transformer language model meant to produce photorealistic pictures using text captions as cues, was unveiled in January. DALL-E’s fantastic performance was an instant hit in the AI community, as well as broad mainstream media coverage. Last month, NVIDIA unveiled the GAN-based GauGAN2 – a term inspired by French Post-Impressionist painter Paul Gauguin, much as DALL-E was inspired by Surrealist artist Salvador Dali.
 Not to be outshined, OpenAI researchers unveiled GLIDE (Guided Language-to-Image Diffusion for Generation and Editing). This diffusion model achieves performance comparable to DALL-E despite utilizing only one-third of the parameters.

 The code and weights for these models may be found on the project’s GitHub page.
 The research paper for the GLIDE can be found here.

 I am working on an implementation for PPO, and I am struggling to compute the loss when two output heads for the actor network are used (one is continuous and one is discrete). The loss in PPO has 3 components: 1) clipped surrogate, 2) squared state-value loss, and 3) Entropy.
 I thought of treating the two actions separately, and compute two different losses that I add before backpropagating, but the middle term (2) is the same in both losses. How could I do that? Do I add (1) and (3) for both actions and have one loss, or do I compute two different losses then add them? Or is it hidden option 3? :p
 ​
 Any help is appreciated.

                    <span>Hello there,
 I noticed that in many works by OpenAI and Deepmind in RL, they deal with a continuous action space which they discretize. For example rather than having to continuous actions to determine speed and direction of movement, they would discretize speed and torque.
 Is there any reason why discretized action space is more favorable?

                    <span>I need an algorithm that combines both discrete and continuous actions space, like if I wanted to choose action but I needed to also perform that action at an optimized velocity or something. Can I do this with ppo and how. I am still a beginner but must of the algorithms I played with had either separately I thought of actor cri but I don’t think the value network does what I want I can’t use that to predict how much velocity to use

                    <span>Hello
 I´ll be glad if someone could help me with this.
 I am new in DRL and when I applied it I got some issues. For example, my network freezes in the same reward from the first episode I noticed also that the agent selects always the same index from the action space. Even the same reward and the same trajectory toward this reward, the critic loss is still shrinking over time (this the weirdest thing)
 I don´t know what is the reson behind that?

                    <span>I&#x27;m trying to see the effect of simulated sensor noise in training a successful policy using RL for the cart pole control problem.
 I have four states: cart position, cart velocity, pole angle, pole angular velocity, and I added Gaussian noise to all of them. However, I want to find the impact of adding noise to a specific variable to find which of the states is the most sensitive to noise.
 If I were to only test the system with noise in one of the variables at a time (e.g. noise for position, but none for the other variables), would that be considered an ablation test?
 Just caught up in the terminology, because I know typical ablation tests remove a certain component instead of adding only one (or removing all but one).

                    <span>Recently, OpenAI removed the robotics tasks from gym, as they are no longer being maintained and Robosuite uses mujoco-py which has been deprecated. Deepmind&#x27;s control suite includes some robotics tasks but they don&#x27;t seem to be first-class citizens (they are in a separate module, with less options and some bugs).
 Are there any other robotics environment suites that are well-maintained and supported?

                    <span>Hello,
 I am new in the Reinforcement Learning field. My question is: how can I easily map my states into my code?
 F.I. when the problem is about how to move an agent in a board-like environment, such as walk from point A to B by moving UP, DOWN, LEFT or RIGHT, it is quite easy to map your states. You can create a matrix like NUMBER_OF_ROWS x NUMBER_OF_COLUMNS and that is pretty much it.
 However when it comes to other type of scenarios, such as CartPole-V0 from OpenAIGym (https://gym.openai.com/envs/CartPole-v0/), I don&#x27;t understand how to map the states into my code.
 This scenario has 4 states and 2 actions:
 States:
  
Cart Position (range -2.4 --&gt; 2.4)
 Cart Velocity (range -Inf --&gt; Inf)
 Pole Angle (range -12deg --&gt; 12deg)
 Pole Angular Velocity (range -Inf --&gt; Inf)
  
Actions:
  
Push cart to the left
 Push cart to the right
  
The same is true for every other scenario that is not board-like, f.i. tic-tac-toe. I don&#x27;t understand how can I make every possible move in the game a state inside the code.
 ​
 Is there any technique to approach each type of problem or do I just need to figure it out by myself? 
 Have a nice day,
 Gabriel.

                    <span>Hi there, I was a graduate student previously working on a few RL-related problems a year ago. And recently I&#x27;ve got much interest in Policy Optimization problems, and started with reading some foundation papers like DQN, DPG.
 While reading the paper of DPG, it was very straightforward to understand the main idea of the paper, however, it was very difficult to understand the proofs of the theorems shown in the appendix(http://proceedings.mlr.press/v32/silver14-supp.pdf). I barely understood the proof of Theorem1, but proof of Theorem2 is almost impossible to understand due to the lack of my mathematics background. 
 The question is that, could you tell me what I should study or learn before understanding this kind of proof? What kind of subject or material should I look for in order to understand the flow of the proofs and related definition/notation used in the proof of &#x27;DPG&#x27;?
 I personally think that it is crucial to understand the proofs of the main Theorem because it will help me to understand the authors&#x27; intuition and motivation which can be the foundation of the paper.

                    <span>With recent breakthroughs in AI, humans have become more reliant on AI to address real-world problems. This makes humans’ ability to learn and act on knowledge just as essential as a computer’s. Humans learn and gather information through learning and experience to understand everything from their immediate surroundings. The ability to comprehend and solve issues, and separate facts from absurdities, increases as the knowledge base grows. However, such knowledge is lacking in AI systems, restricting their ability to adapt to atypical problem data.
 Previous studies show that pre-trained language models improve performance on various natural language interpretation and generating tasks.
 A recent work of researchers at Baidu, in collaboration with Peng Cheng Laboratory (PCL), release PCL-BAIDU Wenxin (or “ERNIE 3.0 Titan”), a pre-training language model with 260 billion parameters. It is the world’s first knowledge-enhanced multi-hundred billion parameter model and its largest Chinese singleton model.

                    <span>What have been your favorite reads of 2021 in terms of RL papers? I will start!
 Reward is enough (Reddit Discussion) - Four great names from RL (silver, Singh, Precup and Sutton) give their reasonings as to why using RL can create super intelligence. You might not agree with it, but it&#x27;s interesting to see the standpoint of Deepmind and where they want to take RL.
 Deep Reinforcement Learning at the Edge of the Statistical Precipice (Reddit Discussion) - This is a major step towards a better model comparison in RL. Too many papers in the past have used a selection technique akin to &#x27;average top 30 runs in a total of 100&#x27;. I have also never even heard of Munchausen RL before this paper, and was pleasantly surprised by reading it.
 Mastering Atari with Discrete World Models - Very good read and a nice path from Ha&#x27;s World Models to Dream to Control to DreamerV2. This is one of the methods this year that actually seems to improve performance quite a bit without needing a large scale distributed approach.
 On the Expressivity of Markov Reward (Reddit Discussion) - The last sentence in the blog post captures it for me: &quot;We hope this work provides new conceptual perspectives on reward and its place in reinforcement learning&quot;, it did.
 Open-Ended Learning Leads to Generally Capable Agents (Reddit Discussion) - Great to see the environment integrated into the learning process, seems like something we will see much more of in the future. Unfortunately, as DeepMind does, the environment is not released nor is the code. I remember positions at OpenAI for open-ended learning, perhaps we might see something next year to compete with this.
 ​
 Most of my picks are not practical algorithms. For me, it seems like PPO is still king when looking at performance and simplicity, kind of a disappointment. I probably missed some papers too. What was your favorite paper in RL 2021? Was it Player of Games (why?), something with Offline RL or perhaps Multi Agents?

                    <span>OpenAI used to do a lot of RL research, but it seems like last year and this year the only real RL related work was on benchmark competitions. They even gave away the control of OpenAI Gym. They still have great RL researchers working there, but nothing major has come out.
 Is it all due to a pivot towards large scale language models that are at least profitable? Is Sam Altman just not interested in RL?

                    <span>Most of the Autoencoder examples/blogs use MNIST dataset as the implementation. I have trained an autoencoder on CIFAR-10 which you can refer here. There is a trade-off between making the CNN architecture deeper and the improvement of reconstruction loss/error. Or, using a VAE.
 Thoughts?

                    <span>Viral keratitis, bacterial keratitis, fungal keratitis, and parasitic keratitis are all types of infectious keratitis. Bacterial Keratitis (BK) is a kind of Infectious Keratitis that is one of the most frequent and vision-threatening. Contact lens wear is the most prevalent risk factor for Bacterial Keratitis (BK), and it is becoming increasingly popular around the world for a variety of reasons, including exercise, cosmesis, and myopia management.
 BK is substantially more fulminant and painful in the clinical course than other Infectious Keratitis(s). A delayed diagnosis of Bacterial Keratitis (BK) can result in large-area corneal ulcerations, melting, and even perforation if not treated.
 In the case of Infectious Keratitis, timely detection and treatment of BK are vital goals. However,…</span>

                    <span>Meta AI releases the beta version of Bean Machine, a probabilistic programming framework based on PyTorch that makes it simple to describe and learn about uncertainty in machine learning models used in various applications. Bean Machine makes it possible to create probabilistic models that are domain-specific. It also uses multiple autonomous, uncertainty-aware learning algorithms to learn about the model’s unseen features. Bean Machine gets an early beta version from Meta.

                    <span>On July 03 2021, the subject of media and news sources came up in a
conversation I had with someone over brunch when we were talking about media
bias. I was asked: “what news do you read?” I regret that I gave a sloppy
response that sounded like a worse version of: “uh, I read a variety of news …”
and then I tried listing a few from memory. I wish I had given a crisper
response, and since that day, I have thought about what that person has asked
me every day.
In this blog post, I describe my information diet, referring to how I read
and consume media to understand current events. Before getting to the actual
list of media sources, here are a few comments to clarify my philosophy and
which might also preemptively address common objections.

I would love if some of you can clarify. If say I have 200 faces and 2000 pictures these faces are in (1 face might be in N pictures), in order to find all the pictures that each face is in, that means I will have to run 400,000 transactions ? As in 2000 iterations per face? Or is there a smarter way to do it?
 I know there is an option to index faces but i do not fully understand that yet.
 Thank you for your help!

                    <span>Sharing machine learning experiments to compare its models is important when you&#x27;re working with a team of engineers. You might need to get another opinion on an experiments results or to share a modified dataset or even share the exact reproduction of a specific experiment.
 The following tutorial goes through an example of sharing an experiment with DVC remotes: Running Collaborative Experiments - using DVC remotes to share experiments and their data across machines
 Setting up DVC remotes in addition to your Git remotes lets you share all of the data, code, and hyperparameters associated with each experiment so anyone can pick up where you left off in the training process. When you use DVC, you can bundle your data and code changes for each experiment and push those to a remote for somebody else to check out.

 I want to show a NN some gameplay. But I don’t know how to. I can capture the keystrokes for each frame but I don’t know what to do next. 
 Do I take screenshots and save those frames w the keystrokes to my disk? 
 I kinda know how to use Cv2, Pillow, and the keyboard module. 
 I’m really lost, so any help will be highly appreciated
 Ps- I want the model to learn how to play the game

                    <span>Yesterday I wrote about the fact that quaternions, unlike complex numbers, can form conjugates via a series of multiplications and additions. This post will show that you can do something similar with octonions. If x is an octonion x &#x3D; r0 e0 + r1 e1 + … + r7 e7 where all the r‘s are […]

                    <span>This post will present a way of multiplying octonions that’s easy to remember. Please note that there are varying conventions for how to define multiplication for octonions [1]. Octonions The complex numbers have one imaginary unit i, and the quaternions have three: i, j, and k. The octonions have seven, and so it makes sense […]

                    <span>Hi all, the NLP for Semantic Search course that I&#x27;ve been working on has just been released, and today the latest chapter on data augmentation with SBERT has been released too!
 It&#x27;s all completely free and covers everything you need to get started with building SotA language models for semantic similarity, from machine translation to question-answering, and more!
 Semantic search allows us to search language-based data based on the semantics or &#x27;meaning&#x27; of a text, from machine translation to question-answering. It&#x27;s how Google understands &quot;what time is it in NYC?&quot;, and even allows us to search for images using text-based queries.
 It is in essence, a way for us to interact with machines in a more human way. NLP fits in as the &#x27;semantic&#x27; in semantic search.
 Current chapters are: 1. Dense Vectors 2. Sentence Embeddings and Transformers 3. Training Sentence Transformers with Softmax Loss 4. Training Sentence Transformers with MNR Loss 5. Multilingual Sentence Transformers 6. Question Answering 7. Unsupervised Training for Sentence Transformers 8. (New) Data Augmentation With BERT
 Let me know what you think, I hope you enjoy it!

                    <span>As a common and (sometimes) proven belief, deep learning systems seem to learn uninterpretable representations and are far from human understanding. Recently, some studies have highlighted the fact that this may not always be applicable, and some networks may be able to learn human-readable representations. Unfortunately, this ability could merely come from the fact that these networks are exposed to human-generated data. So, to demonstrate their ability to learn like humans (and not that they are simply memorizing human-created labels), it is necessary to test them without any label. 
 Following this idea, the DeepMind and Google Brain teams, together with the 14th world chess champion Vladimir Kramnik, studied their creature AlphaZero from this point of view. AlphaZero is the descendant of AlphaGo, the super neural network that beat the world champion Lee Sedol in a best-of-five GO match, a turning point in the history of deep learning, as can also be seen in the wonderful Netflix documentary AlphaGo. 
 Unlike AlphaGo, AlphaZero is trained through self-play (i.e., it learns to play competing against itself) and masters not only GO but also chess and shogi. This trait makes AlphaZero the perfect case study to explore this idea. Moreover, given the fact that it performs at a superhuman level, understanding its functionality is also particularly useful for highlighting unknown patterns which have never been discovered by chess theorists.

                    <span>Posted by Karan Singhal, Senior Software Engineer, Google Research  
Federated learning enables users to train a model without sending raw data to a central server, thus avoiding the collection of privacy-sensitive data. Often this is done by learning a single global model for all users, even though the users may differ in their data distributions. For example, users of a mobile keyboard application may collaborate to train a suggestion model but have different preferences for the suggestions. This heterogeneity has motivated algorithms that can personalize a global model for each user.  
 However, in some settings privacy considerations may prohibit learning a fully global model. Consider models with user-specific embeddings, such as matrix factorization models for recommender systems. Tr…</span>

 ​
 I&#x27;ve been reading about the differences between normal fully-connected feedforward networks and convolutional neural networks, and I&#x27;m wondering if I understand something about how they subsume one another.
 Is a CNN &quot;just&quot; an ANN where the inputs to the network are convolutions over the input?

For a machine learning (ML) algorithm to be effective, useful features must be extracted from (often) large amounts of training data. However, this process can be made challenging due to the costs associated with training on such large datasets, both in terms of compute requirements and wall clock time. The idea of distillation plays an important role in these situations by reducing the resources required for the model to be effective. The most widely known form of distillation is model distillation (a.k.a. knowledge distillation), where the predictions of large, complex teacher models are distilled into smaller models.  
 An alternative option to this model-space approach is dataset …</span>

                    <span>The shortcomings of supervised RL
Reinforcement Learning (RL) is a powerful paradigm for solving many problems of interest in AI, such as controlling autonomous vehicles, digital assistants, and resource allocation to name a few. We’ve seen over the last five years that, when provided with an extrinsic reward function, RL agents can master very complex tasks like playing Go, Starcraft, and dextrous robotic manipulation. While large-scale RL agents can achieve stunning results, even the best RL agents today are narrow. Most RL algorithms today can only solve the single task they were trained on and do not exhibit cross-task or cross-domain generalization capabilities.
A side-effect of the narrowness of today’s RL systems is that today’s RL agents are also very data inefficient. If we were t…</span>

One of these ways is random […]

Multi-horizon forecasting, i.e. predicting variables-of-interest at multiple future time steps, is a crucial challenge in time series machine learning. Most real-world datasets have a time component, and forecasting the future can unlock great value. For example, retailers can use future sales to optimize their supply chain and promotions, investment managers are interested in forecasting the future prices of financial assets to maximize their performance, and healthcare institutions can use the number of future patient admissions to have sufficient personnel and equipment.

Pitttsburgh offices multiple times and was able to contact a staff member for
Senator Toomey.
What follows is a rough transcript of my conversation with the staff member.
This is from memory, so there’s obviously no way that this is all correct, and

Tokenization is a fundamental pre-processing step for most natural language processing (NLP) applications. It involves splitting text into smaller units called tokens (e.g., words or word segments) in order to turn an unstructured input string into a sequence of discrete elements that is suitable for a machine learning (ML) model. ln deep learning–based models (e.g., BERT), each token is mapped to an embedding vector to be fed into the model.  
   


Tokenization in a typical deep learning model, like BERT.

   
A fundamental tokenization approach is to break text into words. However, using this approach, words that are not included in the vocabulary are treated as “unknown”.…</span>

Large language models (e.g., GPT-3) have many significant capabilities, such as performing few-shot learning across a wide array of tasks, including reading comprehension and question answering with very few or no training examples. While these models can perform better by simply using more parameters, training and serving these large models can be very computationally intensive. Is it possible to train and use these models more efficiently?

Scaling neural networks, whether it be the amount of training data used, the model size or the computation being utilized,  has been critical for improving model quality in many real-world machine learning applications, such as computer vision, language understanding and neural machine translation. This, in turn, has motivated recent studies to scrutinize the factors that play a critical role in the success of scaling a neural model. Although increasing model capacity can be a sound approach to improve model quality, doing so presents a number of systems and software engineering challenges that must be overcome. For instance, in order to train large models that exceed the memory capacity of an accel…</span>

Transformer models consistently obtain state-of-the-art results in computer vision tasks, including object detection and video classification. In contrast to standard convolutional approaches that process images pixel-by-pixel, the Vision Transformers (ViT) treat an image as a sequence of patch tokens (i.e., a smaller part, or “patch”, of an image made up of multiple pixels). This means that at every layer, a ViT model recombines and processes patch tokens based on relations between each pair of tokens, using multi-head self-attention. In doing so, ViT models have the capability to construct a global representation of the entire image. 
At the input-level, the tokens are fo…</span>
