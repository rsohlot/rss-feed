                    <span>The new generation of wireless technologies, fitness trackers, and devices
with embedded sensors can have a big impact on healthcare systems and quality
of life. Among the most crucial aspects to consider in these devices are the
accuracy of the data produced and power consumption. Many of the events that
can be monitored, while apparently simple, may not be easily detectable and
recognizable by devices equipped with embedded sensors, especially on devices
with low computing capabilities. It is well known that deep learning reduces
the study of features that contribute to the recognition of the different
target classes. In this work, we present a portable and battery-powered
microcontroller-based device applicable to a wobble board. Wobble boards are
low-cost equipment that can be used for sensorimotor training to avoid ankle
injuries or as part of the rehabilitation process after an injury. The exercise
recognition process was implemented through the use of cognitive techniques
based on deep learning. To reduce power consumption, we add an adaptivity layer
that dynamically manages the device&#x27;s hardware and software configuration to
adapt it to the required operating mode at runtime. Our experimental results
show that adjusting the node configuration to the workload at runtime can save
up to 60% of the power consumed. On a custom dataset, our optimized and
quantized neural network achieves an accuracy value greater than 97% for
detecting some specific physical exercises on a wobble board.</span>

                    <span>This study proposes two new dynamic assignment algorithms to match refugees
and asylum seekers to geographic localities within a host country. The first,
currently implemented in a multi-year pilot in Switzerland, seeks to maximize
the average predicted employment level (or any measured outcome of interest) of
refugees through a minimum-discord online assignment algorithm. Although the
proposed algorithm achieves near-optimal expected employment compared to the
hindsight-optimal solution (and improves upon the status quo procedure by about
40%), it results in a periodically imbalanced allocation to the localities over
time. This leads to undesirable workload inefficiencies for resettlement
resources and agents. To address this problem, the second algorithm balances
the goal of improving refugee outcomes with the desire for an even allocation
over time. The performance of the proposed methods is illustrated using real
refugee resettlement data from a large resettlement agency in the United
States. On this dataset, we find that the allocation balancing algorithm can
achieve near-perfect balance over time with only a small loss in expected
employment compared to the pure employment-maximizing algorithm. In addition,
the allocation balancing algorithm offers a number of ancillary benefits
compared to pure outcome-maximization, including robustness to unknown arrival
flows and greater exploration.</span>

                    <span>Singing voice synthesis (SVS) systems are built to synthesize high-quality
and expressive singing voice, in which the acoustic model generates the
acoustic features (e.g., mel-spectrogram) given a music score. Previous singing
acoustic models adopt a simple loss (e.g., L1 and L2) or generative adversarial
network (GAN) to reconstruct the acoustic features, while they suffer from
over-smoothing and unstable training issues respectively, which hinder the
naturalness of synthesized singing. In this work, we propose DiffSinger, an
acoustic model for SVS based on the diffusion probabilistic model. DiffSinger
is a parameterized Markov chain that iteratively converts the noise into
mel-spectrogram conditioned on the music score. By implicitly optimizing
variational bound, DiffSinger can be stably trained and generate realistic
outputs. To further improve the voice quality and speed up inference, we
introduce a shallow diffusion mechanism to make better use of the prior
knowledge learned by the simple loss. Specifically, DiffSinger starts
generation at a shallow step smaller than the total number of diffusion steps,
according to the intersection of the diffusion trajectories of the ground-truth
mel-spectrogram and the one predicted by a simple mel-spectrogram decoder.
Besides, we propose boundary prediction methods to locate the intersection and
determine the shallow step adaptively. The evaluations conducted on a Chinese
singing dataset demonstrate that DiffSinger outperforms state-of-the-art SVS
work. Extensional experiments also prove the generalization of our methods on
text-to-speech task (DiffSpeech). Audio samples: https://diffsinger.github.io.

                    <span>Apple recently revealed its deep perceptual hashing system NeuralHash to
detect child sexual abuse material (CSAM) on user devices before files are
uploaded to its iCloud service. Public criticism quickly arose regarding the
protection of user privacy and the system&#x27;s reliability. In this paper, we
present the first comprehensive empirical analysis of deep perceptual hashing
based on NeuralHash. Specifically, we show that current deep perceptual hashing
may not be robust. An adversary can manipulate the hash values by applying
slight changes in images, either induced by gradient-based approaches or simply
by performing standard image transformations, forcing or preventing hash
collisions. Such attacks permit malicious actors easily to exploit the
detection system: from hiding abusive material to framing innocent users,
everything is possible. Moreover, using the hash values, inferences can still
be made about the data stored on user devices. In our view, based on our
results, deep perceptual hashing in its current form is generally not ready for
robust client-side scanning and should not be used from a privacy perspective.</span>

                    <span>Embracing the deep learning techniques for representation learning in
clustering research has attracted broad attention in recent years, yielding a
newly developed clustering paradigm, viz. the deep clustering (DC). Typically,
the DC models capitalize on autoencoders to learn the intrinsic features which
facilitate the clustering process in consequence. Nowadays, a generative model
named variational autoencoder (VAE) has got wide acceptance in DC studies.
Nevertheless, the plain VAE is insufficient to perceive the comprehensive
latent features, leading to the deteriorative clustering performance. In this
paper, a novel DC method is proposed to address this issue. Specifically, the
generative adversarial network and VAE are coalesced into a new autoencoder
called fusion autoencoder (FAE) for discerning more discriminative
representation that benefits the downstream clustering task. Besides, the FAE
is implemented with the deep residual network architecture which further
enhances the representation learning ability. Finally, the latent space of the
FAE is transformed to an embedding space shaped by a deep dense neural network
for pulling away different clusters from each other and collapsing data points
within individual clusters. Experiment conducted on several image datasets
demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed DC model against the baseline
methods.</span>

                    <span>In this paper we provide provable regret guarantees for an online
meta-learning receding horizon control algorithm in an iterative control
setting. We consider the setting where, in each iteration the system to be
controlled is a linear deterministic system that is different and unknown, the
cost for the controller in an iteration is a general additive cost function and
there are affine control input constraints. By analysing conditions under which
sub-linear regret is achievable, we prove that the meta-learning online
receding horizon controller achieves an average of the dynamic regret for the
controller cost that is $\tilde{O}((1+1/\sqrt{N})T^{3/4})$ with the number of
iterations $N$. Thus, we show that the worst regret for learning within an
iteration improves with experience of more iterations, with guarantee on rate
of improvement.</span>

                    <span>This paper presents a Fuzzy Cognitive Map model to quantify implicit bias in
structured datasets where features can be numeric or discrete. In our proposal,
problem features are mapped to neural concepts that are initially activated by
experts when running what-if simulations, whereas weights connecting the neural
concepts represent absolute correlation/association patterns between features.
In addition, we introduce a new reasoning mechanism equipped with a
normalization-like transfer function that prevents neurons from saturating.
Another advantage of this new reasoning mechanism is that it can easily be
controlled by regulating nonlinearity when updating neurons&#x27; activation values
in each iteration. Finally, we study the convergence of our model and derive
analytical conditions concerning the existence and unicity of fixed-point
attractors.</span>

                    <span>Instrumental variables (IVs), sources of treatment randomization that are
conditionally independent of the outcome, play an important role in causal
inference with unobserved confounders. However, the existing IV-based
counterfactual prediction methods need well-predefined IVs, while it is an art
rather than science to find valid IVs in many real-world scenes. Moreover, the
predefined hand-made IVs could be weak or erroneous by violating the conditions
of valid IVs. These thorny facts hinder the application of the IV-based
counterfactual prediction methods. In this paper, we propose a novel Automatic
Instrumental Variable decomposition (AutoIV) algorithm to automatically
generate representations serving the role of IVs from observed variables (IV
candidates). Specifically, we let the learned IV representations satisfy the
relevance condition with the treatment and exclusion condition with the outcome
via mutual information maximization and minimization constraints, respectively.
We also learn confounder representations by encouraging them to be relevant to
both the treatment and the outcome. The IV and confounder representations
compete for the information with their constraints in an adversarial game,
which allows us to get valid IV representations for IV-based counterfactual
prediction. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method generates valid
IV representations for accurate IV-based counterfactual prediction.</span>

                    <span>Learning the physical dynamics of deformable objects with particle-based
representation has been the objective of many computational models in machine
learning. While several state-of-the-art models have achieved this objective in
simulated environments, most existing models impose a precondition, such that
the input is a sequence of ordered point sets. That is, the order of the points
in each point set must be the same across the entire input sequence. This
precondition restrains the model from generalizing to real-world data, which is
considered to be a sequence of unordered point sets. In this paper, we propose
a model named time-wise PointNet (TP-Net) that solves this problem by directly
consuming a sequence of unordered point sets to infer the future state of a
deformable object with particle-based representation. Our model consists of a
shared feature extractor that extracts global features from each input point
set in parallel and a prediction network that aggregates and reasons on these
features for future prediction. The key concept of our approach is that we use
global features rather than local features to achieve invariance to input
permutations and ensure the stability and scalability of our model. Experiments
demonstrate that our model achieves state-of-the-art performance with real-time
prediction speed in both synthetic dataset and real-world dataset. In addition,
we provide quantitative and qualitative analysis on why our approach is more
effective and efficient than existing approaches.</span>

                    <span>Motivation: Computational models that accurately identify high-affinity
protein-chemical pairs can accelerate drug discovery pipelines. These models,
trained on available protein-chemical interaction datasets, can be used to
predict the binding affinity of an input protein-chemical pair. However, the
training datasets may contain surface patterns, called dataset biases, which
cause models to memorize dataset-specific biomolecule properties, instead of
learning binding mechanisms. As a result, the prediction performance of models
drops for unseen biomolecules. Here, we present DebiasedDTA, a novel
drug-target affinity (DTA) prediction model training framework that addresses
dataset biases to improve affinity prediction for novel biomolecules.
DebiasedDTA uses ensemble learning and sample weight adaptation to identify and
avoid biases and is applicable to most DTA prediction models. Results: The
results show that DebiasedDTA can boost models while predicting the
interactions between unseen biomolecules. In addition, prediction performance
for seen biomolecules also improves. The experiments also show that DebiasedDTA
can augment DTA prediction models of different input and model structures and
is able to avoid biases of different sources. The investigations of predictions
reveal that model debiasing can diminish the importance of misleading features
and can enable models to learn more from the proteins. DebiasedDTA is published
as an open-source python package to enable debiasing custom DTA prediction
models with only two lines of code.</span>

                    <span>Bulk synchronous parallel (BSP) is the de-facto paradigm for distributed DNN
training in today&#x27;s production clusters. However, due to the global
synchronization nature, its performance can be significantly influenced by
network bottlenecks caused by either static topology heterogeneity or dynamic
bandwidth contentions. Existing solutions, either system-level optimizations
strengthening BSP (e.g., Ring or Hierarchical All-reduce) or algorithmic
optimizations replacing BSP (e.g., ASP or SSP, which relax the global
barriers), do not completely solve the problem, as they may still suffer from
communication inefficiency or risk convergence inaccuracy.

In this paper, we present a novel divide-and-shuffle synchronization
(DS-Sync) to realize communication efficiency without sacrificing convergence
accuracy for distributed DNN training. At its heart, by taking into account the
network bottlenecks, DS-Sync improves communication efficiency by dividing
workers into non-overlap groups to synchronize independently in a
bottleneck-free manner. Meanwhile, it maintains convergence accuracy by
iteratively shuffling workers among different groups to ensure a global
consensus. We theoretically prove that DS-Sync converges properly in non-convex
and smooth conditions like DNN. We further implement DS-Sync and integrate it
with PyTorch, and our testbed experiments show that DS-Sync can achieve up to
$94\%$ improvements on the end-to-end training time with existing solutions
while maintaining the same accuracy.</span>

their representation in the shared vector space. In this paper, to improve the

AST and build the multimodal representation for the code data. We conduct
extensive experiments using a single corpus that is large-scale and
multi-language: CodeSearchNet. Our results show that both our tree-serialized

(NURBS) are the de facto standard used in CAD, but their utility in deep
learning-based approaches is not well researched. We propose a differentiable
NURBS module to integrate NURBS representations of CAD models with deep
learning methods. We mathematically define the derivatives of the NURBS curves
or surfaces with respect to the input parameters (control points, weights, and
the knot vector). These derivatives are used to define an approximate Jacobian
used for performing the &quot;backward&quot; evaluation to train the deep learning
models. We have implemented our NURBS module using GPU-accelerated algorithms
and integrated it with PyTorch, a popular deep learning framework. We
demonstrate the efficacy of our NURBS module in performing CAD operations such
as curve or surface fitting and surface offsetting. Further, we show its
utility in deep learning for unsupervised point cloud reconstruction and
enforce analysis constraints. These examples show that our module performs
better for certain deep learning frameworks and can be directly integrated with
any deep-learning framework requiring NURBS.</span>

                    <span>NLP researchers need more, higher-quality text datasets. Human-labeled
datasets are expensive to collect, while datasets collected via automatic
retrieval from the web such as WikiBio are noisy and can include undesired
biases. Moreover, data sourced from the web is often included in datasets used
to pretrain models, leading to inadvertent cross-contamination of training and
test sets. In this work we introduce a novel method for efficient dataset
curation: we use a large language model to provide seed generations to human
raters, thereby changing dataset authoring from a writing task to an editing
task. We use our method to curate SynthBio - a new evaluation set for WikiBio -
composed of structured attribute lists describing fictional individuals, mapped
to natural language biographies. We show that our dataset of fictional
biographies is less noisy than WikiBio, and also more balanced with respect to
gender and nationality.</span>

                    <span>Traffic forecasting plays a crucial role in intelligent transportation
systems. The spatial-temporal complexities in transportation networks make the
problem especially challenging. The recently suggested deep learning models
share basic elements such as graph convolution, graph attention, recurrent
units, and/or attention mechanism. In this study, we designed an in-depth
comparative study for four deep neural network models utilizing different basic
elements. For base models, one RNN-based model and one attention-based model
were chosen from previous literature. Then, the spatial feature extraction
layers in the models were substituted with graph convolution and graph
attention. To analyze the performance of each element in various environments,
we conducted experiments on four real-world datasets - highway speed, highway
flow, urban speed from a homogeneous road link network, and urban speed from a
heterogeneous road link network. The results demonstrate that the RNN-based
model and the attention-based model show a similar level of performance for
short-term prediction, and the attention-based model outperforms the RNN in
longer-term predictions. The choice of graph convolution and graph attention
makes a larger difference in the RNN-based models. Also, our modified version
of GMAN shows comparable performance with the original with less memory
consumption.</span>

                    <span>Thanks to their scalability, two-stage recommenders are used by many of
today&#x27;s largest online platforms, including YouTube, LinkedIn, and Pinterest.
These systems produce recommendations in two steps: (i) multiple nominators,
tuned for low prediction latency, preselect a small subset of candidates from
the whole item pool; (ii) a slower but more accurate ranker further narrows
down the nominated items, and serves to the user. Despite their popularity, the
literature on two-stage recommenders is relatively scarce, and the algorithms
are often treated as mere sums of their parts. Such treatment presupposes that
the two-stage performance is explained by the behavior of the individual
components in isolation. This is not the case: using synthetic and real-world
data, we demonstrate that interactions between the ranker and the nominators
substantially affect the overall performance. Motivated by these findings, we
derive a generalization lower bound which shows that independent nominator
training can lead to performance on par with uniformly random recommendations.
We find that careful design of item pools, each assigned to a different
nominator, alleviates these issues. As manual search for a good pool allocation
is difficult, we propose to learn one instead using a Mixture-of-Experts based
approach. This significantly improves both precision and recall at K.</span>

                    <span>A central challenge in data-driven model discovery is the presence of hidden,
or latent, variables that are not directly measured but are dynamically
important. Takens&#x27; theorem provides conditions for when it is possible to
augment these partial measurements with time delayed information, resulting in
an attractor that is diffeomorphic to that of the original full-state system.
However, the coordinate transformation back to the original attractor is
typically unknown, and learning the dynamics in the embedding space has
remained an open challenge for decades. Here, we design a custom deep
autoencoder network to learn a coordinate transformation from the delay
embedded space into a new space where it is possible to represent the dynamics
in a sparse, closed form. We demonstrate this approach on the Lorenz,
R\&quot;ossler, and Lotka-Volterra systems, learning dynamics from a single
measurement variable. As a challenging example, we learn a Lorenz analogue from
a single scalar variable extracted from a video of a chaotic waterwheel
experiment. The resulting modeling framework combines deep learning to uncover
effective coordinates and the sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics
(SINDy) for interpretable modeling. Thus, we show that it is possible to
simultaneously learn a closed-form model and the associated coordinate system
for partially observed dynamics.</span>

                    <span>Freight carriers rely on tactical planning to design their service network to
satisfy demand in a cost-effective way. For computational tractability,
deterministic and cyclic Service Network Design (SND) formulations are used to
solve large-scale problems. A central input is the periodic demand, that is,
the demand expected to repeat in every period in the planning horizon. In
practice, demand is predicted by a time series forecasting model and the
periodic demand is the average of those forecasts. This is, however, only one
of many possible mappings. The problem consisting in selecting this mapping has
hitherto been overlooked in the literature. We propose to use the structure of
the downstream decision-making problem to select a good mapping. For this
purpose, we introduce a multilevel mathematical programming formulation that
explicitly links the time series forecasts to the SND problem of interest. The
solution is a periodic demand estimate that minimizes costs over the tactical
planning horizon. We report results in an extensive empirical study of a
large-scale application from the Canadian National Railway Company. They
clearly show the importance of the periodic demand estimation problem. Indeed,
the planning costs exhibit an important variation over different periodic
demand estimates and using an estimate different from the mean forecast can
lead to substantial cost reductions. Moreover, the costs associated with the
periodic demand estimates based on forecasts were comparable to, or even better
than those obtained using the mean of actual demand.</span>

                    <span>We study the dynamics of a neural network in function space when optimizing
the mean squared error via gradient flow. We show that in the
underparameterized regime the network learns eigenfunctions of an integral
operator $T_{K^\infty}$ determined by the Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) at rates
corresponding to their eigenvalues. For example, for uniformly distributed data
on the sphere $S^{d - 1}$ and rotation invariant weight distributions, the
eigenfunctions of $T_{K^\infty}$ are the spherical harmonics. Our results can
be understood as describing a spectral bias in the underparameterized regime.
The proofs use the concept of &quot;Damped Deviations&quot;, where deviations of the NTK
matter less for eigendirections with large eigenvalues due to the occurence of
a damping factor. Aside from the underparameterized regime, the damped
deviations point-of-view can be used to track the dynamics of the empirical
risk in the overparameterized setting, allowing us to extend certain results in
the literature. We conclude that damped deviations offers a simple and unifying
perspective of the dynamics when optimizing the squared error.</span>

                    <span>Because of the impact of extreme heat waves and heat domes on society and
biodiversity, their study is a key challenge. We specifically study
long-lasting extreme heat waves, which are among the most important for climate
impacts. Physics driven weather forecast systems or climate models can be used
to forecast their occurrence or predict their probability. The present work
explores the use of deep learning architectures, trained using outputs of a
climate model, as an alternative strategy to forecast the occurrence of extreme
long-lasting heatwaves. This new approach will be useful for several key
scientific goals which include the study of climate model statistics, building
a quantitative proxy for resampling rare events in climate models, study the
impact of climate change, and should eventually be useful for forecasting.
Fulfilling these important goals implies addressing issues such as class-size
imbalance that is intrinsically associated with rare event prediction,
assessing the potential benefits of transfer learning to address the nested
nature of extreme events (naturally included in less extreme ones). We train a
Convolutional Neural Network, using 1000 years of climate model outputs, with
large-class undersampling and transfer learning. From the observed snapshots of
the surface temperature and the 500 hPa geopotential height fields, the trained
network achieves significant performance in forecasting the occurrence of
long-lasting extreme heatwaves. We are able to predict them at three different
levels of intensity, and as early as 15 days ahead of the start of the event
(30 days ahead of the end of the event).</span>

                    <span>In this work, we study a variant of nonnegative matrix factorization where we
wish to find a symmetric factorization of a given input matrix into a sparse,
Boolean matrix. Formally speaking, given $\mathbf{M}\in\mathbb{Z}^{m\times m}$,
we want to find $\mathbf{W}\in\{0,1\}^{m\times r}$ such that $\| \mathbf{M} -
\mathbf{W}\mathbf{W}^\top \|_0$ is minimized among all $\mathbf{W}$ for which
each row is $k$-sparse. This question turns out to be closely related to a
number of questions like recovering a hypergraph from its line graph, as well
as reconstruction attacks for private neural network training.

As this problem is hard in the worst-case, we study a natural average-case
variant that arises in the context of these reconstruction attacks: $\mathbf{M}
&#x3D; \mathbf{W}\mathbf{W}^{\top}$ for $\mathbf{W}$ a random Boolean matrix with
$k$-sparse rows, and the goal is to recover $\mathbf{W}$ up to column
permutation. Equivalently, this can be thought of as recovering a uniformly
random $k$-uniform hypergraph from its line graph.

Our main result is a polynomial-time algorithm for this problem based on
bootstrapping higher-order information about $\mathbf{W}$ and then decomposing
an appropriate tensor. The key ingredient in our analysis, which may be of
independent interest, is to show that such a matrix $\mathbf{W}$ has full
column rank with high probability as soon as $m &#x3D; \widetilde{\Omega}(r)$, which
we do using tools from Littlewood-Offord theory and estimates for binary
Krawtchouk polynomials.</span>

                    <span>The analysis of data streams has received considerable attention over the
past few decades due to sensors, social media, etc. It aims to recognize
patterns in an unordered, infinite, and evolving stream of observations.
Clustering this type of data requires some restrictions in time and memory.
This paper introduces a new data stream clustering method (IMOC-Stream). This
method, unlike the other clustering algorithms, uses two different objective
functions to capture different aspects of the data. The goal of IMOC-Stream is
to: 1) reduce computation time by using idle times to apply genetic operations
and enhance the solution. 2) reduce memory allocation by introducing a new tree
synopsis. 3) find arbitrarily shaped clusters by using a multi-objective
framework. We conducted an experimental study with high dimensional stream
datasets and compared them to well-known stream clustering techniques. The
experiments show the ability of our method to partition the data stream in
arbitrarily shaped, compact, and well-separated clusters while optimizing the
time and memory. Our method also outperformed most of the stream algorithms in
terms of NMI and ARAND measures.</span>

                    <span>Understanding the operation of biological and artificial networks remains a
difficult and important challenge. To identify general principles, researchers
are increasingly interested in surveying large collections of networks that are
trained on, or biologically adapted to, similar tasks. A standardized set of
analysis tools is now needed to identify how network-level covariates -- such
as architecture, anatomical brain region, and model organism -- impact neural
representations (hidden layer activations). Here, we provide a rigorous
foundation for these analyses by defining a broad family of metric spaces that
quantify representational dissimilarity. Using this framework we modify
existing representational similarity measures based on canonical correlation
analysis to satisfy the triangle inequality, formulate a novel metric that
respects the inductive biases in convolutional layers, and identify approximate
Euclidean embeddings that enable network representations to be incorporated
into essentially any off-the-shelf machine learning method. We demonstrate
these methods on large-scale datasets from biology (Allen Institute Brain
Observatory) and deep learning (NAS-Bench-101). In doing so, we identify
relationships between neural representations that are interpretable in terms of
anatomical features and model performance.</span>

                    <span>Learning and synthesizing stabilizing controllers for unknown nonlinear
systems is a challenging problem for real-world and industrial applications.
Koopman operator theory allow one to analyze nonlinear systems through the lens
of linear systems and nonlinear control systems through the lens of bilinear
control systems. The key idea of these methods, lies in the transformation of
the coordinates of the nonlinear system into the Koopman observables, which are
coordinates that allow the representation of the original system (control
system) as a higher dimensional linear (bilinear control) system. However, for
nonlinear control systems, the bilinear control model obtained by applying
Koopman operator based learning methods is not necessarily stabilizable and
therefore, the existence of a stabilizing feedback control is not guaranteed
which is crucial for many real world applications. Simultaneous identification
of these stabilizable Koopman based bilinear control systems as well as the
associated Koopman observables is still an open problem. In this paper, we
propose a framework to identify and construct these stabilizable bilinear
models and its associated observables from data by simultaneously learning a
bilinear Koopman embedding for the underlying unknown nonlinear control system
as well as a Control Lyapunov Function (CLF) for the Koopman based bilinear
model using a learner and falsifier. Our proposed approach thereby provides
provable guarantees of global asymptotic stability for the nonlinear control
systems with unknown dynamics. Numerical simulations are provided to validate
the efficacy of our proposed class of stabilizing feedback controllers for
unknown nonlinear systems.</span>

                    <span>Successful deep learning models often involve training neural network
architectures that contain more parameters than the number of training samples.
Such overparametrized models have been extensively studied in recent years, and
the virtues of overparametrization have been established from both the
statistical perspective, via the double-descent phenomenon, and the
computational perspective via the structural properties of the optimization
landscape.

Despite the remarkable success of deep learning architectures in the
overparametrized regime, it is also well known that these models are highly
vulnerable to small adversarial perturbations in their inputs. Even when
adversarially trained, their performance on perturbed inputs (robust
generalization) is considerably worse than their best attainable performance on
benign inputs (standard generalization). It is thus imperative to understand
how overparametrization fundamentally affects robustness.

In this paper, we will provide a precise characterization of the role of
overparametrization on robustness by focusing on random features regression
models (two-layer neural networks with random first layer weights). We consider

trained. Our developed theory reveals the nontrivial effect of
overparametrization on robustness and indicates that for adversarially trained
random features models, high overparametrization can hurt robust

                    <span>This paper aims to provide a novel design of a multiscale framelets
convolution for spectral graph neural networks. In the spectral paradigm,
spectral GNNs improve graph learning task performance via proposing various
spectral filters in spectral domain to capture both global and local graph
structure information. Although the existing spectral approaches show superior
performance in some graphs, they suffer from lack of flexibility and being
fragile when graph information are incomplete or perturbated. Our new framelets
convolution incorporates the filtering func-tions directly designed in the
spectral domain to overcome these limitations. The proposed convolution shows a
great flexibility in cutting-off spectral information and effectively mitigate
the negative effect of noisy graph signals. Besides, to exploit the
heterogeneity in real-world graph data, the heterogeneous graph neural network
with our new framelet convolution provides a solution for embedding the
intrinsic topological information of meta-path with a multi-level graph
analysis.Extensive experiments have been conducted on real-world heterogeneous
graphs and homogeneous graphs under settings with noisy node features and
superior performance results are achieved.</span>

                    <span>The marine ecosystem is changing at an alarming rate, exhibiting biodiversity
loss and the migration of tropical species to temperate basins. Monitoring the
underwater environments and their inhabitants is of fundamental importance to
understand the evolution of these systems and implement safeguard policies.
However, assessing and tracking biodiversity is often a complex task,
especially in large and uncontrolled environments, such as the oceans. One of
the most popular and effective methods for monitoring marine biodiversity is
passive acoustics monitoring (PAM), which employs hydrophones to capture
underwater sound. Many aquatic animals produce sounds characteristic of their
own species; these signals travel efficiently underwater and can be detected
even at great distances. Furthermore, modern technologies are becoming more and
more convenient and precise, allowing for very accurate and careful data
acquisition. To date, audio captured with PAM devices is frequently manually
processed by marine biologists and interpreted with traditional signal
processing techniques for the detection of animal vocalizations. This is a
challenging task, as PAM recordings are often over long periods of time.
Moreover, one of the causes of biodiversity loss is sound pollution; in data
obtained from regions with loud anthropic noise, it is hard to separate the
artificial from the fish sound manually. Nowadays, machine learning and, in
particular, deep learning represents the state of the art for processing audio
signals. Specifically, sound separation networks are able to identify and
separate human voices and musical instruments. In this work, we show that the
same techniques can be successfully used to automatically extract fish
vocalizations in PAM recordings, opening up the possibility for biodiversity
monitoring at a large scale.</span>

                    <span>Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems have become ubiquitous. They can
be found in a variety of form factors and are increasingly important in our
daily lives. As such, ensuring that these systems are equitable to different
subgroups of the population is crucial. In this paper, we introduce, AequeVox,
an automated testing framework for evaluating the fairness of ASR systems.
AequeVox simulates different environments to assess the effectiveness of ASR
systems for different populations. In addition, we investigate whether the
chosen simulations are comprehensible to humans. We further propose a fault
localization technique capable of identifying words that are not robust to
these varying environments. Both components of AequeVox are able to operate in
the absence of ground truth data.

We evaluated AequeVox on speech from four different datasets using three
different commercial ASRs. Our experiments reveal that non-native English,
female and Nigerian English speakers generate 109%, 528.5% and 156.9% more
errors, on average than native English, male and UK Midlands speakers,
respectively. Our user study also reveals that 82.9% of the simulations
(employed through speech transformations) had a comprehensibility rating above
seven (out of ten), with the lowest rating being 6.78. This further validates
the fairness violations discovered by AequeVox. Finally, we show that the
non-robust words, as predicted by the fault localization technique embodied in
AequeVox, show 223.8% more errors than the predicted robust words across all
ASRs.</span>

                    <span>In this paper, we investigate the question: Given a small number of
datapoints, for example N &#x3D; 30, how tight can PAC-Bayes and test set bounds be
made? For such small datasets, test set bounds adversely affect generalisation
performance by withholding data from the training procedure. In this setting,
PAC-Bayes bounds are especially attractive, due to their ability to use all the
data to simultaneously learn a posterior and bound its generalisation risk. We
focus on the case of i.i.d. data with a bounded loss and consider the generic
PAC-Bayes theorem of Germain et al. While their theorem is known to recover
many existing PAC-Bayes bounds, it is unclear what the tightest bound derivable
from their framework is. For a fixed learning algorithm and dataset, we show
that the tightest possible bound coincides with a bound considered by Catoni;
and, in the more natural case of distributions over datasets, we establish a
lower bound on the best bound achievable in expectation. Interestingly, this
lower bound recovers the Chernoff test set bound if the posterior is equal to
the prior. Moreover, to illustrate how tight these bounds can be, we study
synthetic one-dimensional classification tasks in which it is feasible to
meta-learn both the prior and the form of the bound to numerically optimise for
the tightest bounds possible. We find that in this simple, controlled scenario,
PAC-Bayes bounds are competitive with comparable, commonly used Chernoff test
set bounds. However, the sharpest test set bounds still lead to better
guarantees on the generalisation error than the PAC-Bayes bounds we consider.</span>

improving the training dynamics. We achieve the latter by maximizing the
gradients of the new weights and find the optimal initialization efficiently by
means of the singular value decomposition (SVD). We call this technique
Gradient Maximizing Growth (GradMax) and demonstrate its effectiveness in

                    <span>Existing distributed cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL)
frameworks usually assume undirected coordination graphs and communication
graphs while estimating a global reward via consensus algorithms for policy
evaluation. Such a framework may induce expensive communication costs and
exhibit poor scalability due to requirement of global consensus. In this work,
we study MARLs with directed coordination graphs, and propose a distributed RL
algorithm where the local policy evaluations are based on local value
functions. The local value function of each agent is obtained by local
communication with its neighbors through a directed learning-induced
communication graph, without using any consensus algorithm. A zeroth-order
optimization (ZOO) approach based on parameter perturbation is employed to
achieve gradient estimation. By comparing with existing ZOO-based RL
algorithms, we show that our proposed distributed RL algorithm guarantees high
scalability. A distributed resource allocation example is shown to illustrate
the effectiveness of our algorithm.</span>

that the L2 error decreases similarly to kernel herding, while the computation

                    <span>In response to the continuously changing feedstock supply and market demand
for products with different specifications, the processes need to be operated
at time-varying operating conditions and targets (e.g., setpoints) to improve
the process economy, in contrast to traditional process operations around
predetermined equilibriums. In this paper, a contraction theory-based control
approach using neural networks is developed for nonlinear chemical processes to
achieve time-varying reference tracking. This approach leverages the universal
approximation characteristics of neural networks with discrete-time contraction
analysis and control. It involves training a neural network to learn a
contraction metric and differential feedback gain, that is embedded in a
contraction-based controller. A second, separate neural network is also
incorporated into the control-loop to perform online learning of uncertain
system model parameters. The resulting control scheme is capable of achieving
efficient offset-free tracking of time-varying references, with a full range of
model uncertainty, without the need for controller structure redesign as the
reference changes. This is a robust approach that can deal with bounded
parametric uncertainties in the process model, which are commonly encountered
in industrial (chemical) processes. This approach also ensures the process
stability during online simultaneous learning and control. Simulation examples
are provided to illustrate the above approach.</span>

                    <span>Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs) are a natural and
general model in reinforcement learning that take into account the agent&#x27;s
uncertainty about its current state. In the literature on POMDPs, it is
customary to assume access to a planning oracle that computes an optimal policy
when the parameters are known, even though the problem is known to be
computationally hard. Almost all existing planning algorithms either run in
exponential time, lack provable performance guarantees, or require placing
strong assumptions on the transition dynamics under every possible policy. In
this work, we revisit the planning problem and ask: are there natural and
well-motivated assumptions that make planning easy?

Our main result is a quasipolynomial-time algorithm for planning in
(one-step) observable POMDPs. Specifically, we assume that well-separated
distributions on states lead to well-separated distributions on observations,
and thus the observations are at least somewhat informative in each step.
Crucially, this assumption places no restrictions on the transition dynamics of
the POMDP; nevertheless, it implies that near-optimal policies admit
quasi-succinct descriptions, which is not true in general (under standard
hardness assumptions). Our analysis is based on new quantitative bounds for
filter stability -- i.e. the rate at which an optimal filter for the latent
state forgets its initialization. Furthermore, we prove matching hardness for
planning in observable POMDPs under the Exponential Time Hypothesis.</span>

                    <span>How related are the representations learned by neural language models,
translation models, and language tagging tasks? We answer this question by
adapting an encoder-decoder transfer learning method from computer vision to
investigate the structure among 100 different feature spaces extracted from
hidden representations of various networks trained on language tasks. This
method reveals a low-dimensional structure where language models and
translation models smoothly interpolate between word embeddings, syntactic and
semantic tasks, and future word embeddings. We call this low-dimensional
structure a language representation embedding because it encodes the
relationships between representations needed to process language for a variety
of NLP tasks. We find that this representation embedding can predict how well
each individual feature space maps to human brain responses to natural language
stimuli recorded using fMRI. Additionally, we find that the principal dimension
of this structure can be used to create a metric which highlights the brain&#x27;s
natural language processing hierarchy. This suggests that the embedding
captures some part of the brain&#x27;s natural language representation structure.</span>

well-known graph isomorphism problem and appears in many applications,
including social network deanonymization and cellular biology. Our focus here
is on partial recovery, i.e., we look for a one-to-one mapping which is correct
on a fraction of the nodes of the graph rather than on all of them, and we
assume that the two input graphs to the problem are correlated
Erd\H{o}s-R\&#x27;enyi graphs of parameters $(n,q,s)$. Our main contribution is then
to give necessary and sufficient conditions on $(n,q,s)$ under which partial

In this regime, the effect of random initialization and the process of training

                    <span>Real-world imagery is often characterized by a significant imbalance of the
number of images per class, leading to long-tailed distributions. An effective
and simple approach to long-tailed visual recognition is to learn feature
representations and a classifier separately, with instance and class-balanced
sampling, respectively. In this work, we introduce a new framework, by making
the key observation that a feature representation learned with instance
sampling is far from optimal in a long-tailed setting. Our main contribution is
a new training method, referred to as Class-Balanced Distillation (CBD), that
leverages knowledge distillation to enhance feature representations. CBD allows
the feature representation to evolve in the second training stage, guided by
the teacher learned in the first stage. The second stage uses class-balanced
sampling, in order to focus on under-represented classes. This framework can
naturally accommodate the usage of multiple teachers, unlocking the information
from an ensemble of models to enhance recognition capabilities. Our experiments
show that the proposed technique consistently outperforms the state of the art
on long-tailed recognition benchmarks such as ImageNet-LT, iNaturalist17 and
iNaturalist18.</span>

                    <span>In this paper, we consider the widely used but not fully understood
stochastic estimator based on moving average (SEMA), which only requires {\bf a
general unbiased stochastic oracle}. We demonstrate the power of SEMA on a
range of stochastic non-convex optimization problems. In particular, we analyze
various stochastic methods (existing or newly proposed) based on the {\bf
variance recursion property} of SEMA for three families of non-convex
optimization, namely standard stochastic non-convex minimization, stochastic
non-convex strongly-concave min-max optimization, and stochastic bilevel
optimization. Our contributions include: (i) for standard stochastic non-convex
minimization, we present a simple and intuitive proof of convergence for a
family of Adam-style methods (including Adam, AMSGrad, AdaBound, etc.) with an
increasing or large &quot;momentum&quot; parameter for the first-order moment, which
gives an alternative yet more natural way to guarantee Adam converge; (ii) for
stochastic non-convex strongly-concave min-max optimization, we present a
single-loop primal-dual stochastic momentum and adaptive methods based on the
moving average estimators and establish its oracle complexity of
$O(1/\epsilon^4)$ without using a large mini-batch size, addressing a gap in
the literature; (iii) for stochastic bilevel optimization, we present a
single-loop stochastic method based on the moving average estimators and
establish its oracle complexity of $\widetilde O(1/\epsilon^4)$ without
computing the SVD of the Hessian matrix, improving state-of-the-art results.
For all these problems, we also establish a variance diminishing result for the
used stochastic gradient estimators.</span>

                    <span>Hyperparameter plays an essential role in the fitting of supervised machine
learning algorithms. However, it is computationally expensive to tune all the
tunable hyperparameters simultaneously especially for large data sets. In this
paper, we give a definition of hyperparameter importance that can be estimated
by subsampling procedures. According to the importance, hyperparameters can
then be tuned on the entire data set more efficiently. We show theoretically
that the proposed importance on subsets of data is consistent with the one on
the population data under weak conditions. Numerical experiments show that the
proposed importance is consistent and can save a lot of computational
resources.</span>

                    <span>We propose a novel stochastic network model, called Fractal Gaussian Network
(FGN), that embodies well-defined and analytically tractable fractal
structures. Such fractal structures have been empirically observed in diverse
applications. FGNs interpolate continuously between the popular purely random
geometric graphs (a.k.a. the Poisson Boolean network), and random graphs with
increasingly fractal behavior. In fact, they form a parametric family of sparse
random geometric graphs that are parametrized by a fractality parameter which
governs the strength of the fractal structure. FGNs are driven by the latent
spatial geometry of Gaussian Multiplicative Chaos (GMC), a canonical model of
fractality in its own right. We asymptotically characterize the expected number
of edges, triangles, cliques and hub-and-spoke motifs in FGNs, unveiling a
distinct pattern in their scaling with the size parameter of the network. We
then examine the natural question of detecting the presence of fractality and
the problem of parameter estimation based on observed network data, in addition
to fundamental properties of the FGN as a random graph model. We also explore
fractality in community structures by unveiling a natural stochastic block
model in the setting of FGNs. Finally, we substantiate our results with
phenomenological analysis of the FGN in the context of available scientific
literature for fractality in networks, including applications to real-world
massive network data.</span>

                    <span>Despite the intense attention and considerable investment into clinical
machine learning research, relatively few applications have been deployed at a
large-scale in a real-world clinical environment. While research is important
in advancing the state-of-the-art, translation is equally important in bringing
these techniques and technologies into a position to ultimately impact
healthcare. We believe a lack of appreciation for several considerations are a
major cause for this discrepancy between expectation and reality. To better
characterize a holistic perspective among researchers and practitioners, we
survey several practitioners with commercial experience in developing CML for
clinical deployment. Using these insights, we identify several main categories
of challenges in order to better design and develop clinical machine learning

                    <span>This paper focuses on the problem of semi-supervised domain adaptation for
time-series forecasting, which is underexplored in literatures, despite being
often encountered in practice. Existing methods on time-series domain
adaptation mainly follow the paradigm designed for the static data, which
cannot handle domain-specific complex conditional dependencies raised by data
offset, time lags, and variant data distributions. In order to address these
challenges, we analyze variational conditional dependencies in time-series data
and find that the causal structures are usually stable among domains, and
further raise the causal conditional shift assumption. Enlightened by this
assumption, we consider the causal generation process for time-series data and
propose an end-to-end model for the semi-supervised domain adaptation problem
on time-series forecasting. Our method can not only discover the Granger-Causal
structures among cross-domain data but also address the cross-domain
time-series forecasting problem with accurate and interpretable predicted
results. We further theoretically analyze the superiority of the proposed
method, where the generalization error on the target domain is bounded by the
empirical risks and by the discrepancy between the causal structures from
different domains. Experimental results on both synthetic and real data
demonstrate the effectiveness of our method for the semi-supervised domain
adaptation method on time-series forecasting.</span>

                    <span>End-to-end optimized neural image compression (NIC) has obtained superior
lossy compression performance recently. In this paper, we consider the problem
of rate-distortion (R-D) characteristic analysis and modeling for NIC. We make
efforts to formulate the essential mathematical functions to describe the R-D
behavior of NIC using deep networks. Thus arbitrary bit-rate points could be
elegantly realized by leveraging such model via a single trained network. We
propose a plugin-in module to learn the relationship between the target
bit-rate and the binary representation for the latent variable of auto-encoder.
The proposed scheme resolves the problem of training distinct models to reach
different points in the R-D space. Furthermore, we model the rate and
distortion characteristic of NIC as a function of the coding parameter
$\lambda$ respectively. Our experiments show our proposed method is easy to
adopt and realizes state-of-the-art continuous bit-rate coding performance,
which implies that our approach would benefit the practical deployment of NIC.</span>

                    <span>The recommendation system, relying on historical observational data to model
the complex relationships among the users and items, has achieved great success
in real-world applications. Selection bias is one of the most important issues
of the existing observational data based approaches, which is actually caused
by multiple types of unobserved exposure strategies (e.g. promotions and
holiday effects). Though various methods have been proposed to address this
problem, they are mainly relying on the implicit debiasing techniques but not
explicitly modeling the unobserved exposure strategies. By explicitly
Reconstructing Exposure STrategies (REST in short), we formalize the
recommendation problem as the counterfactual reasoning and propose the debiased
social recommendation method. In REST, we assume that the exposure of an item
is controlled by the latent exposure strategies, the user, and the item. Based
on the above generation process, we first provide the theoretical guarantee of
our method via identification analysis. Second, we employ a variational
auto-encoder to reconstruct the latent exposure strategies, with the help of
the social networks and the items. Third, we devise a counterfactual reasoning
based recommendation algorithm by leveraging the recovered exposure strategies.
Experiments on four real-world datasets, including three published datasets and
one private WeChat Official Account dataset, demonstrate significant
improvements over several state-of-the-art methods.</span>

                    <span>The COVID-19 pandemic has emphasized the need for a robust understanding of
epidemic models. Current models of epidemics are classified as either
mechanistic or non-mechanistic: mechanistic models make explicit assumptions on
the dynamics of disease, whereas non-mechanistic models make assumptions on the
form of observed time series. Here, we introduce a simple mixture-based model
which bridges the two approaches while retaining benefits of both. The model
represents time series of cases and fatalities as a mixture of Gaussian curves,
providing a flexible function class to learn from data compared to traditional
mechanistic models. Although the model is non-mechanistic, we show that it
arises as the natural outcome of a stochastic process based on a networked SIR
framework. This allows learned parameters to take on a more meaningful
interpretation compared to similar non-mechanistic models, and we validate the
interpretations using auxiliary mobility data collected during the COVID-19
pandemic. We provide a simple learning algorithm to identify model parameters
and establish theoretical results which show the model can be efficiently
learned from data. Empirically, we find the model to have low prediction error.
The model is available live at covidpredictions.mit.edu. Ultimately, this
allows us to systematically understand the impacts of interventions on
COVID-19, which is critical in developing data-driven solutions to controlling
epidemics.</span>

                    <span>Internet-delivered psychological treatments (IDPT) are seen as an effective
and scalable pathway to improving the accessibility of mental healthcare.
Within this context, treatment adherence is an especially relevant challenge to
address due to the reduced interaction between healthcare professionals and
patients, compared to more traditional interventions. In parallel, there are
increasing regulations when using peoples&#x27; personal data, especially in the
digital sphere. In such regulations, data minimization is often a core tenant
such as within the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). Consequently,
this work proposes a deep-learning approach to perform automatic adherence
forecasting, while only relying on minimally sensitive login/logout data. This
approach was tested on a dataset containing 342 patients undergoing guided
internet-delivered cognitive behavioral therapy (G-ICBT) treatment. The
proposed Self-Attention Network achieved over 70% average balanced accuracy,
when only 1/3 of the treatment duration had elapsed. As such, this study
demonstrates that automatic adherence forecasting for G-ICBT, is achievable
using only minimally sensitive data, thus facilitating the implementation of
such tools within real-world IDPT platforms.</span>

challenging problem, as an exhaustive search among all candidate beam pairs
cannot be assuredly completed within short contact times. We solve this problem
via a novel expediting beam selection by leveraging multimodal data collected
from sensors like LiDAR, camera images, and GPS. We propose individual modality
and distributed fusion-based deep learning (F-DL) architectures that can
execute locally as well as at a mobile edge computing center (MEC), with a
study on associated tradeoffs. We also formulate and solve an optimization
problem that considers practical beam-searching, MEC processing and
sensor-to-MEC data delivery latency overheads for determining the output
dimensions of the above F-DL architectures. Results from extensive evaluations
conducted on publicly available synthetic and home-grown real-world datasets
reveal 95% and 96% improvement in beam selection speed over classical RF-only
beam sweeping, respectively. F-DL also outperforms the state-of-the-art
techniques by 20-22% in predicting top-10 best beam pairs.</span>

computational intelligence techniques to study the numerical solution of the
Ornstein-Zernike equation for simple liquids. In particular, a continuous model
of the hard sphere fluid is studied. There are two main proposals in this
contribution. First, the use of neural networks as a way to parametrize closure
relation when solving the Ornstein-Zernike equation. It is explicitly shown
that in the case of the hard sphere fluid, the neural network approach seems to
reduce to the so-called Hypernetted Chain closure. For the second proposal, we
explore the fact that if more physical information is incorporated into the
theoretical formalism, a better estimate can be obtained with the use of
evolutionary optimization techniques. When choosing the modified Verlet closure
relation, and leaving a couple of free parameters to be adjusted, the results
are as good as those obtained from molecular simulations. The thesis is then
closed with a brief summary of the main findings and outlooks on different ways
to improve the proposals presented here.</span>

                    <span>Measuring the predictability and complexity of time series using entropy is
essential tool de-signing and controlling a nonlinear system. However, the
existing methods have some drawbacks related to the strong dependence of
entropy on the parameters of the methods. To overcome these difficulties, this
study proposes a new method for estimating the entropy of a time series using
the LogNNet neural network model. The LogNNet reservoir matrix is filled with
time series elements according to our algorithm. The accuracy of the
classification of images from the MNIST-10 database is considered as the
entropy measure and denoted by NNetEn. The novelty of entropy calculation is
that the time series is involved in mixing the input information in the
res-ervoir. Greater complexity in the time series leads to a higher
classification accuracy and higher NNetEn values. We introduce a new time
series characteristic called time series learning inertia that determines the
learning rate of the neural network. The robustness and efficiency of the
method is verified on chaotic, periodic, random, binary, and constant time
series. The comparison of NNetEn with other methods of entropy estimation
demonstrates that our method is more robust and accurate and can be widely used
in practice.</span>

systems with a hyperbolic linear part that are subject to external forcing with
finitely many frequencies. Our data-driven, sparse, nonlinear models are
obtained as extended normal forms of the reduced dynamics on low-dimensional,
attracting spectral submanifolds (SSMs) of the dynamical system. We illustrate
the power of data-driven SSM reduction on high-dimensional numerical data sets

                    <span>There is an increasing interest in emulating Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs)
on neuromorphic computing devices due to their low energy consumption. Recent
advances have allowed training SNNs to a point where they start to compete with
traditional Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) in terms of accuracy, while at
the same time being energy efficient when run on neuromorphic hardware.
However, the process of training SNNs is still based on dense tensor operations
originally developed for ANNs which do not leverage the spatiotemporally sparse
nature of SNNs. We present here the first sparse SNN backpropagation algorithm
which achieves the same or better accuracy as current state of the art methods
while being significantly faster and more memory efficient. We show the
effectiveness of our method on real datasets of varying complexity
(Fashion-MNIST, Neuromophic-MNIST and Spiking Heidelberg Digits) achieving a
speedup in the backward pass of up to 150x, and 85% more memory efficient,

                    <span>Many statistical machine approaches could ultimately highlight novel features
of the etiology of complex diseases by analyzing multi-omics data. However,
they are sensitive to some deviations in distribution when the observed samples
are potentially contaminated with adversarial corrupted outliers (e.g., a
fictional data distribution). Likewise, statistical advances lag in supporting
comprehensive data-driven analyses of complex multi-omics data integration. We
propose a novel non-linear M-estimator-based approach, &quot;robust kernel machine
regression (RobKMR),&quot; to improve the robustness of statistical machine
regression and the diversity of fictional data to examine the higher-order
composite effect of multi-omics datasets. We address a robust kernel-centered
Gram matrix to estimate the model parameters accurately. We also propose a
robust score test to assess the marginal and joint Hadamard product of features
from multi-omics data. We apply our proposed approach to a multi-omics dataset
of osteoporosis (OP) from Caucasian females. Experiments demonstrate that the
proposed approach effectively identifies the inter-related risk factors of OP.
With solid evidence (p-value &#x3D; 0.00001), biological validations, network-based
analysis, causal inference, and drug repurposing, the selected three triplets
((DKK1, SMTN, DRGX), (MTND5, FASTKD2, CSMD3), (MTND5, COG3, CSMD3)) are
significant biomarkers and directly relate to BMD. Overall, the top three
selected genes (DKK1, MTND5, FASTKD2) and one gene (SIDT1 at p-value&#x3D; 0.001)
significantly bond with four drugs- Tacrolimus, Ibandronate, Alendronate, and
Bazedoxifene out of 30 candidates for drug repurposing in OP. Further, the
proposed approach can be applied to any disease model where multi-omics
datasets are available.</span>

                    <span>The challenging field of scene text detection requires complex data
annotation, which is time-consuming and expensive. Techniques, such as weak
supervision, can reduce the amount of data needed. In this paper we propose a
weak supervision method for scene text detection, which makes use of
reinforcement learning (RL). The reward received by the RL agent is estimated
by a neural network, instead of being inferred from ground-truth labels. First,
we enhance an existing supervised RL approach to text detection with several
training optimizations, allowing us to close the performance gap to
regression-based algorithms. We then use our proposed system in a weakly- and
semi-supervised training on real-world data. Our results show that training in
a weakly supervised setting is feasible. However, we find that using our model
in a semi-supervised setting , e.g. when combining labeled synthetic data with
unannotated real-world data, produces the best results.</span>

                    <span>In this paper, we study the learning of safe policies in the setting of
reinforcement learning problems. This is, we aim to control a Markov Decision
Process (MDP) of which we do not know the transition probabilities, but we have
access to sample trajectories through experience. We define safety as the agent
remaining in a desired safe set with high probability during the operation
time. We therefore consider a constrained MDP where the constraints are
probabilistic. Since there is no straightforward way to optimize the policy
with respect to the probabilistic constraint in a reinforcement learning
framework, we propose an ergodic relaxation of the problem. The advantages of
the proposed relaxation are threefold. (i) The safety guarantees are maintained
in the case of episodic tasks and they are kept up to a given time horizon for
continuing tasks. (ii) The constrained optimization problem despite its
non-convexity has arbitrarily small duality gap if the parametrization of the
policy is rich enough. (iii) The gradients of the Lagrangian associated with
the safe-learning problem can be easily computed using standard policy gradient
results and stochastic approximation tools. Leveraging these advantages, we
establish that primal-dual algorithms are able to find policies that are safe
and optimal. We test the proposed approach in a navigation task in a continuous
domain. The numerical results show that our algorithm is capable of dynamically
adapting the policy to the environment and the required safety levels.</span>

                    <span>$k$-means clustering is a fundamental problem in various disciplines. This
problem is nonconvex, and standard algorithms are only guaranteed to find a
local optimum. Leveraging the structure of local solutions characterized in
[1], we propose a general algorithmic framework for escaping undesirable local
solutions and recovering the global solution (or the ground truth). This
framework consists of alternating between the following two steps iteratively:
(i) detect mis-specified clusters in a local solution and (ii) improve the
current local solution by non-local operations. We discuss implementation of
these steps, and elucidate how the proposed framework unifies variants of
$k$-means algorithm in literature from a geometric perspective. In addition, we
introduce two natural extensions of the proposed framework, where the initial
number of clusters is misspecified. We provide theoretical justification for
our approach, which is corroborated with extensive experiments.</span>

                    <span>We propose a decentralised &quot;local2global&quot;&#x27; approach to graph representation
learning, that one can a-priori use to scale any embedding technique. Our
local2global approach proceeds by first dividing the input graph into
overlapping subgraphs (or &quot;patches&quot;) and training local representations for
each patch independently. In a second step, we combine the local
representations into a globally consistent representation by estimating the set
of rigid motions that best align the local representations using information
from the patch overlaps, via group synchronization. A key distinguishing
feature of local2global relative to existing work is that patches are trained
independently without the need for the often costly parameter synchronization
during distributed training. This allows local2global to scale to large-scale
industrial applications, where the input graph may not even fit into memory and
may be stored in a distributed manner. We apply local2global on data sets of
different sizes and show that our approach achieves a good trade-off between
scale and accuracy on edge reconstruction and semi-supervised classification.
We also consider the downstream task of anomaly detection and show how one can
use local2global to highlight anomalies in cybersecurity networks.</span>

                    <span>Aggregate time-series data like traffic flow and site occupancy repeatedly
sample statistics from a population across time. Such data can be profoundly
useful for understanding trends within a given population, but also pose a
significant privacy risk, potentially revealing e.g., who spends time where.
Producing a private version of a time-series satisfying the standard definition
of Differential Privacy (DP) is challenging due to the large influence a single
participant can have on the sequence: if an individual can contribute to each
time step, the amount of additive noise needed to satisfy privacy increases
linearly with the number of time steps sampled. As such, if a signal spans a
long duration or is oversampled, an excessive amount of noise must be added,
drowning out underlying trends. However, in many applications an individual
realistically cannot participate at every time step. When this is the case, we
observe that the influence of a single participant (sensitivity) can be reduced
by subsampling and/or filtering in time, while still meeting privacy
requirements. Using a novel analysis, we show this significant reduction in
sensitivity and propose a corresponding class of privacy mechanisms. We
demonstrate the utility benefits of these techniques empirically with
real-world and synthetic time-series data.</span>

                    <span>Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) continues to pose a great challenge to
the world since its outbreak. To fight against the disease, a series of
artificial intelligence (AI) techniques are developed and applied to real-world
scenarios such as safety monitoring, disease diagnosis, infection risk
assessment, lesion segmentation of COVID-19 CT scans,etc. The coronavirus
epidemics have forced people wear masks to counteract the transmission of
virus, which also brings difficulties to monitor large groups of people wearing
masks. In this paper, we primarily focus on the AI techniques of masked facial
detection and related datasets. We survey the recent advances, beginning with
the descriptions of masked facial detection datasets. Thirteen available
datasets are described and discussed in details. Then, the methods are roughly
categorized into two classes: conventional methods and neural network-based
methods. Conventional methods are usually trained by boosting algorithms with
hand-crafted features, which accounts for a small proportion. Neural
network-based methods are further classified as three parts according to the
number of processing stages. Representative algorithms are described in detail,
coupled with some typical techniques that are described briefly. Finally, we
summarize the recent benchmarking results, give the discussions on the
limitations of datasets and methods, and expand future research directions. To
our knowledge, this is the first survey about masked facial detection methods
and datasets. Hopefully our survey could provide some help to fight against
epidemics.</span>

                    <span>Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) between two significantly disparate
domains to learn high-level semantic alignment is a crucial yet challenging
task.~To this end, in this work, we propose exploiting low-level edge
information to facilitate the adaptation as a precursor task, which has a small
cross-domain gap, compared with semantic segmentation.~The precise contour then
provides spatial information to guide the semantic adaptation. More
specifically, we propose a multi-task framework to learn a contouring
adaptation network along with a semantic segmentation adaptation network, which
takes both magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) slice and its initial edge map as
input.~These two networks are jointly trained with source domain labels, and
the feature and edge map level adversarial learning is carried out for
cross-domain alignment. In addition, self-entropy minimization is incorporated
to further enhance segmentation performance. We evaluated our framework on the
BraTS2018 database for cross-modality segmentation of brain tumors, showing the
validity and superiority of our approach, compared with competing methods.</span>

model which learns cross lingual speech representations from raw audio across
23 Indic languages. It is built on top of wav2vec 2.0 which is solved by
training a contrastive task over masked latent speech representations and
jointly learns the quantization of latents shared across all languages. We
compare the language wise loss during pretraining to compare effects of
monolingual and multilingual pretraining. Performance on some downstream
fine-tuning tasks for speech recognition is also compared and our experiments
show that multilingual pretraining outperforms monolingual training, in terms
of learning speech representations which encodes phonetic similarity of
languages and also in terms of performance on down stream tasks. A decrease of
5% is observed in WER and 9.5% in CER when a multilingual pretrained model is
used for finetuning in Hindi. All the code models are also open sourced.
CLSRIL-23 is a model trained on $23$ languages and almost 10,000 hours of audio

                    <span>We study an online learning problem subject to the constraint of individual
fairness, which requires that similar individuals are treated similarly. Unlike
prior work on individual fairness, we do not assume the similarity measure
among individuals is known, nor do we assume that such measure takes a certain
parametric form. Instead, we leverage the existence of an auditor who detects
fairness violations without enunciating the quantitative measure. In each
round, the auditor examines the learner&#x27;s decisions and attempts to identify a
pair of individuals that are treated unfairly by the learner. We provide a
general reduction framework that reduces online classification in our model to
standard online classification, which allows us to leverage existing online
learning algorithms to achieve sub-linear regret and number of fairness
violations. Surprisingly, in the stochastic setting where the data are drawn
independently from a distribution, we are also able to establish PAC-style
fairness and accuracy generalization guarantees (Yona and Rothblum [2018]),
despite only having access to a very restricted form of fairness feedback. Our
fairness generalization bound qualitatively matches the uniform convergence
bound of Yona and Rothblum [2018], while also providing a meaningful accuracy
generalization guarantee. Our results resolve an open question by Gillen et al.
[2018] by showing that online learning under an unknown individual fairness
constraint is possible even without assuming a strong parametric form of the
underlying similarity measure.</span>

                    <span>Most adversarial attack defense methods rely on obfuscating gradients. These
methods are successful in defending against gradient-based attacks; however,
they are easily circumvented by attacks which either do not use the gradient or
by attacks which approximate and use the corrected gradient. Defenses that do
not obfuscate gradients such as adversarial training exist, but these
approaches generally make assumptions about the attack such as its magnitude.
We propose a classification model that does not obfuscate gradients and is
robust by construction without assuming prior knowledge about the attack. Our
method casts classification as an optimization problem where we &quot;invert&quot; a
conditional generator trained on unperturbed, natural images to find the class
that generates the closest sample to the query image. We hypothesize that a
potential source of brittleness against adversarial attacks is the
high-to-low-dimensional nature of feed-forward classifiers which allows an
adversary to find small perturbations in the input space that lead to large
changes in the output space. On the other hand, a generative model is typically
a low-to-high-dimensional mapping. While the method is related to Defense-GAN,
the use of a conditional generative model and inversion in our model instead of
the feed-forward classifier is a critical difference. Unlike Defense-GAN, which
was shown to generate obfuscated gradients that are easily circumvented, we
show that our method does not obfuscate gradients. We demonstrate that our
model is extremely robust against black-box attacks and has improved robustness
against white-box attacks compared to naturally trained, feed-forward
classifiers.</span>

inter-variable dependencies. Existing works only learn temporal patterns with
the help of single inter-variable dependencies. However, there are multi-scale
temporal patterns in many real-world MTS. Single inter-variable dependencies
make the model prefer to learn one type of prominent and shared temporal
patterns. In this paper, we propose a multi-scale adaptive graph neural network
(MAGNN) to address the above issue. MAGNN exploits a multi-scale pyramid
network to preserve the underlying temporal dependencies at different time
scales. Since the inter-variable dependencies may be different under distinct
time scales, an adaptive graph learning module is designed to infer the
scale-specific inter-variable dependencies without pre-defined priors. Given
the multi-scale feature representations and scale-specific inter-variable
dependencies, a multi-scale temporal graph neural network is introduced to
jointly model intra-variable dependencies and inter-variable dependencies.
After that, we develop a scale-wise fusion module to effectively promote the
collaboration across different time scales, and automatically capture the
importance of contributed temporal patterns. Experiments on four real-world
datasets demonstrate that MAGNN outperforms the state-of-the-art methods across
various settings.</span>

                    <span>Critical periods are phases during which a toddler&#x27;s brain develops in
spurts. To promote children&#x27;s cognitive development, proper guidance is
critical in this stage. However, it is not clear whether such a critical period
also exists for the training of AI agents. Similar to human toddlers,
well-timed guidance and multimodal interactions might significantly enhance the
training efficiency of AI agents as well. To validate this hypothesis, we adapt
this notion of critical periods to learning in AI agents and investigate the
critical period in the virtual environment for AI agents. We formalize the
critical period and Toddler-guidance learning in the reinforcement learning
(RL) framework. Then, we built up a toddler-like environment with VECA toolkit
to mimic human toddlers&#x27; learning characteristics. We study three discrete
levels of mutual interaction: weak-mentor guidance (sparse reward), moderate
mentor guidance (helper-reward), and mentor demonstration (behavioral cloning).
We also introduce the EAVE dataset consisting of 30,000 real-world images to
fully reflect the toddler&#x27;s viewpoint. We evaluate the impact of critical
periods on AI agents from two perspectives: how and when they are guided best
in both uni- and multimodal learning. Our experimental results show that both
uni- and multimodal agents with moderate mentor guidance and critical period on
1 million and 2 million training steps show a noticeable improvement. We
validate these results with transfer learning on the EAVE dataset and find the
performance advancement on the same critical period and the guidance.</span>

                    <span>Graph problems such as traveling salesman problem, or finding minimal Steiner
trees are widely studied and used in data engineering and computer science.
Typically, in real-world applications, the features of the graph tend to change
over time, thus, finding a solution to the problem becomes challenging. The
dynamic version of many graph problems are the key for a plethora of real-world
problems in transportation, telecommunication, and social networks. In recent
years, using deep learning techniques to find heuristic solutions for NP-hard
graph combinatorial problems has gained much interest as these learned
heuristics can find near-optimal solutions efficiently. However, most of the
existing methods for learning heuristics focus on static graph problems. The
dynamic nature makes NP-hard graph problems much more challenging to learn, and
the existing methods fail to find reasonable solutions.

In this paper, we propose a novel architecture named Graph Temporal Attention
with Reinforcement Learning (GTA-RL) to learn heuristic solutions for
graph-based dynamic combinatorial optimization problems. The GTA-RL
architecture consists of an encoder capable of embedding temporal features of a
combinatorial problem instance and a decoder capable of dynamically focusing on
the embedded features to find a solution to a given combinatorial problem
instance. We then extend our architecture to learn heuristics for the real-time
version of combinatorial optimization problems where all input features of a
problem are not known a prior, but rather learned in real-time. Our
experimental results against several state-of-the-art learning-based algorithms
and optimal solvers demonstrate that our approach outperforms the
state-of-the-art learning-based approaches in terms of effectiveness and
optimal solvers in terms of efficiency on dynamic and real-time graph
combinatorial optimization.</span>

                    <span>Reinforcement Learning and recently Deep Reinforcement Learning are popular
methods for solving sequential decision making problems modeled as Markov
Decision Processes. RL modeling of a problem and selecting algorithms and
hyper-parameters require careful considerations as different configurations may
entail completely different performances. These considerations are mainly the
task of RL experts; however, RL is progressively becoming popular in other
fields where the researchers and system designers are not RL experts. Besides,
many modeling decisions, such as defining state and action space, size of
batches and frequency of batch updating, and number of timesteps are typically
made manually. For these reasons, automating different components of RL
framework is of great importance and it has attracted much attention in recent
years. Automated RL provides a framework in which different components of RL
including MDP modeling, algorithm selection and hyper-parameter optimization
are modeled and defined automatically. In this article, we explore the
literature and present recent work that can be used in automated RL. Moreover,
we discuss the challenges, open questions and research directions in AutoRL.</span>

                    <span>Since sparse neural networks usually contain many zero weights, these
unnecessary network connections can potentially be eliminated without degrading
network performance. Therefore, well-designed sparse neural networks have the
potential to significantly reduce FLOPs and computational resources. In this
work, we propose a new automatic pruning method - Sparse Connectivity Learning
(SCL). Specifically, a weight is re-parameterized as an element-wise
multiplication of a trainable weight variable and a binary mask. Thus, network
connectivity is fully described by the binary mask, which is modulated by a
unit step function. We theoretically prove the fundamental principle of using a
straight-through estimator (STE) for network pruning. This principle is that
the proxy gradients of STE should be positive, ensuring that mask variables
converge at their minima. After finding Leaky ReLU, Softplus, and Identity STEs
can satisfy this principle, we propose to adopt Identity STE in SCL for
discrete mask relaxation. We find that mask gradients of different features are
very unbalanced, hence, we propose to normalize mask gradients of each feature
to optimize mask variable training. In order to automatically train sparse
masks, we include the total number of network connections as a regularization
term in our objective function. As SCL does not require pruning criteria or
hyper-parameters defined by designers for network layers, the network is
explored in a larger hypothesis space to achieve optimized sparse connectivity
for the best performance. SCL overcomes the limitations of existing automatic
pruning methods. Experimental results demonstrate that SCL can automatically
learn and select important network connections for various baseline network
structures. Deep learning models trained by SCL outperform the SOTA
human-designed and automatic pruning methods in sparsity, accuracy, and FLOPs
reduction.</span>

                    <span>Federated learning has generated significant interest, with nearly all works
focused on a &quot;star&quot; topology where nodes/devices are each connected to a
central server. We migrate away from this architecture and extend it through
the network dimension to the case where there are multiple layers of nodes
between the end devices and the server. Specifically, we develop multi-stage
hybrid federated learning (MH-FL), a hybrid of intra- and inter-layer model
learning that considers the network as a multi-layer cluster-based structure.
MH-FL considers the topology structures among the nodes in the clusters,
including local networks formed via device-to-device (D2D) communications, and
presumes a semi-decentralized architecture for federated learning. It
orchestrates the devices at different network layers in a
collaborative/cooperative manner (i.e., using D2D interactions) to form local
consensus on the model parameters and combines it with multi-stage parameter
relaying between layers of the tree-shaped hierarchy. We derive the upper bound
of convergence for MH-FL with respect to parameters of the network topology
(e.g., the spectral radius) and the learning algorithm (e.g., the number of D2D
rounds in different clusters). We obtain a set of policies for the D2D rounds
at different clusters to guarantee either a finite optimality gap or
convergence to the global optimum. We then develop a distributed control
algorithm for MH-FL to tune the D2D rounds in each cluster over time to meet
specific convergence criteria. Our experiments on real-world datasets verify
our analytical results and demonstrate the advantages of MH-FL in terms of
resource utilization metrics.</span>

                    <span>Neyman-Scott process (NSP) are point process models that generate clusters of
points in time or space. They are natural models for a wide range of phenomena,
ranging from neural spike trains to document streams. The clustering property
is achieved via a doubly stochastic formulation: first, a set of latent events
is drawn from a Poisson process; then, each latent event generates a set of
observed data points according to another Poisson process. This construction is
similar to Bayesian nonparametric mixture models like the Dirichlet process
mixture model (DPMM) in that the number of latent events (i.e. clusters) is a
random variable, but the point process formulation makes the NSP especially
well suited to modeling spatiotemporal data. While many specialized algorithms
have been developed for DPMMs, comparatively fewer works have focused on
inference in NSPs. Here, we present novel connections between NSPs and DPMMs,
with the key link being a third class of Bayesian mixture models called mixture
of finite mixture models (MFMMs). Leveraging this connection, we adapt the
standard collapsed Gibbs sampling algorithm for DPMMs to enable scalable
Bayesian inference on NSP models. We demonstrate the potential of Neyman-Scott
processes on a variety of applications including sequence detection in neural
spike trains and event detection in document streams.</span>

                    <span>We present SeamlessGAN, a method capable of automatically generating tileable
texture maps from a single input exemplar. In contrast to most existing
methods, focused solely on solving the synthesis problem, our work tackles both
problems, synthesis and tileability, simultaneously. Our key idea is to realize
that tiling a latent space within a generative network trained using
adversarial expansion techniques produces outputs with continuity at the seam
intersection that can be then be turned into tileable images by cropping the
central area. Since not every value of the latent space is valid to produce
high-quality outputs, we leverage the discriminator as a perceptual error
metric capable of identifying artifact-free textures during a sampling process.
Further, in contrast to previous work on deep texture synthesis, our model is
designed and optimized to work with multi-layered texture representations,
enabling textures composed of multiple maps such as albedo, normals, etc. We
extensively test our design choices for the network architecture, loss function
and sampling parameters. We show qualitatively and quantitatively that our
approach outperforms previous methods and works for textures of different
types.</span>

leverag-ing the relationships between different views of the same object. Most

multiple views. But not all of this information is useful for classification
tasks. Instead, it is the specific discriminating information that plays an

                    <span>Stock Movement Prediction (SMP) aims at predicting listed companies&#x27; stock
future price trend, which is a challenging task due to the volatile nature of
financial markets. Recent financial studies show that the momentum spillover
effect plays a significant role in stock fluctuation. However, previous studies
typically only learn the simple connection information among related companies,
which inevitably fail to model complex relations of listed companies in the
real financial market. To address this issue, we first construct a more
comprehensive Market Knowledge Graph (MKG) which contains bi-typed entities
including listed companies and their associated executives, and
hybrid-relations including the explicit relations and implicit relations.
Afterward, we propose DanSmp, a novel Dual Attention Networks to learn the

different potential security and privacy issues, requiring protection
mechanisms to be adaptive, reliable, and scalable. Machine learning (ML) based

                    <span>In a neuron network, synapses update individually using local information,
allowing for entirely decentralized learning. In contrast, elements in an
artificial neural network (ANN) are typically updated simultaneously using a
central processor. Here we investigate the feasibility and effect of
asynchronous learning in a recently introduced decentralized, physics-driven
learning network. We show that desynchronizing the learning process does not
degrade performance for a variety of tasks in an idealized simulation. In
experiment, desynchronization actually improves performance by allowing the
system to better explore the discretized state space of solutions. We draw an
analogy between asynchronicity and mini-batching in stochastic gradient
descent, and show that they have similar effects on the learning process.
Desynchronizing the learning process establishes physics-driven learning
networks as truly fully distributed learning machines, promoting better
performance and scalability in deployment.</span>

                    <span>We study the practical consequences of dataset sampling strategies on the
ranking performance of recommendation algorithms. Recommender systems are
generally trained and evaluated on samples of larger datasets. Samples are
often taken in a naive or ad-hoc fashion: e.g. by sampling a dataset randomly
or by selecting users or items with many interactions. As we demonstrate,
commonly-used data sampling schemes can have significant consequences on
algorithm performance. Following this observation, this paper makes three main
contributions: (1) characterizing the effect of sampling on algorithm
performance, in terms of algorithm and dataset characteristics (e.g. sparsity
characteristics, sequential dynamics, etc.); (2) designing SVP-CF, which is a
data-specific sampling strategy, that aims to preserve the relative performance
of models after sampling, and is especially suited to long-tailed interaction
data; and (3) developing an oracle, Data-Genie, which can suggest the sampling
scheme that is most likely to preserve model performance for a given dataset.
The main benefit of Data-Genie is that it will allow recommender system
practitioners to quickly prototype and compare various approaches, while
remaining confident that algorithm performance will be preserved, once the
algorithm is retrained and deployed on the complete data. Detailed experiments
show that using Data-Genie, we can discard upto 5x more data than any sampling
strategy with the same level of performance.</span>

                    <span>A common approach to prediction and planning in partially observable domains
is to use recurrent neural networks (RNNs), which ideally develop and maintain
a latent memory about hidden, task-relevant factors. We hypothesize that many
of these hidden factors in the physical world are constant over time, changing
only sparsely. To study this hypothesis, we propose Gated $L_0$ Regularized
Dynamics (GateL0RD), a novel recurrent architecture that incorporates the
inductive bias to maintain stable, sparsely changing latent states. The bias is
implemented by means of a novel internal gating function and a penalty on the
$L_0$ norm of latent state changes. We demonstrate that GateL0RD can compete
with or outperform state-of-the-art RNNs in a variety of partially observable
prediction and control tasks. GateL0RD tends to encode the underlying
generative factors of the environment, ignores spurious temporal dependencies,
and generalizes better, improving sampling efficiency and overall performance
in model-based planning and reinforcement learning tasks. Moreover, we show
that the developing latent states can be easily interpreted, which is a step
towards better explainability in RNNs.</span>

                    <span>Deep neural networks (DNNs) have demonstrated superior performance over
classical machine learning to support many features in safety-critical systems.
Although DNNs are now widely used in such systems (e.g., self driving cars),
there is limited progress regarding automated support for functional safety
analysis in DNN-based systems. For example, the identification of root causes
of errors, to enable both risk analysis and DNN retraining, remains an open
problem. In this paper, we propose SAFE, a black-box approach to automatically
characterize the root causes of DNN errors. SAFE relies on a transfer learning
model pre-trained on ImageNet to extract the features from error-inducing
images. It then applies a density-based clustering algorithm to detect
arbitrary shaped clusters of images modeling plausible causes of error. Last,
clusters are used to effectively retrain and improve the DNN. The black-box
nature of SAFE is motivated by our objective not to require changes or even
access to the DNN internals to facilitate adoption.

Experimental results show the superior ability of SAFE in identifying
different root causes of DNN errors based on case studies in the automotive
domain. It also yields significant improvements in DNN accuracy after
retraining, while saving significant execution time and memory when compared to
alternatives.</span>

                    <span>The echo state network (ESN) is a special type of recurrent neural networks
for processing the time-series dataset. However, limited by the strong
correlation among sequential samples of the agent, ESN-based policy control
algorithms are difficult to use the recursive least squares (RLS) algorithm to
update the ESN&#x27;s parameters. To solve this problem, we propose two novel policy
control algorithms, ESNRLS-Q and ESNRLS-Sarsa. Firstly, to reduce the
correlation of training samples, we use the leaky integrator ESN and the
mini-batch learning mode. Secondly, to make RLS suitable for training ESN in
mini-batch mode, we present a new mean-approximation method for updating the
RLS correlation matrix. Thirdly, to prevent ESN from over-fitting, we use the
L1 regularization technique. Lastly, to prevent the target state-action value
from overestimation, we employ the Mellowmax method. Simulation results show
that our algorithms have good convergence performance.</span>

                    <span>We address the problem of production planning and distribution in
multi-echelon supply chains. We consider uncertain demands and lead times which
makes the problem stochastic and non-linear. A Markov Decision Process
formulation and a Non-linear Programming model are presented. As a sequential
decision-making problem, Deep Reinforcement Learning (RL) is a possible
solution approach. This type of technique has gained a lot of attention from
Artificial Intelligence and Optimization communities in recent years.
Considering the good results obtained with Deep RL approaches in different
areas there is a growing interest in applying them in problems from the
Operations Research field. We have used a Deep RL technique, namely Proximal
Policy Optimization (PPO2), to solve the problem considering uncertain, regular
and seasonal demands and constant or stochastic lead times. Experiments are
carried out in different scenarios to better assess the suitability of the
algorithm. An agent based on a linearized model is used as a baseline.
Experimental results indicate that PPO2 is a competitive and adequate tool for
this type of problem. PPO2 agent is better than baseline in all scenarios with
stochastic lead times (7.3-11.2%), regardless of whether demands are seasonal
or not. In scenarios with constant lead times, the PPO2 agent is better when
uncertain demands are non-seasonal (2.2-4.7%). The results show that the
greater the uncertainty of the scenario, the greater the viability of this type
of approach.</span>

                    <span>ML models are typically trained using large datasets of high quality.
However, training datasets often contain inconsistent or incomplete data. To
tackle this issue, one solution is to develop algorithms that can check whether
a prediction of a model is certifiably robust. Given a learning algorithm that
produces a classifier and given an example at test time, a classification
outcome is certifiably robust if it is predicted by every model trained across
all possible worlds (repairs) of the uncertain (inconsistent) dataset. This
notion of robustness falls naturally under the framework of certain answers. In
this paper, we study the complexity of certifying robustness for a simple but
widely deployed classification algorithm, $k$-Nearest Neighbors ($k$-NN). Our
main focus is on inconsistent datasets when the integrity constraints are
functional dependencies (FDs). For this setting, we establish a dichotomy in
the complexity of certifying robustness w.r.t. the set of FDs: the problem
either admits a polynomial time algorithm, or it is coNP-hard. Additionally, we
exhibit a similar dichotomy for the counting version of the problem, where the
goal is to count the number of possible worlds that predict a certain label. As
a byproduct of our study, we also establish the complexity of a problem related
to finding an optimal subset repair that may be of independent interest.</span>

                    <span>Traffic forecasting models rely on data that needs to be sensed, processed,
and stored. This requires the deployment and maintenance of traffic sensing
infrastructure, often leading to unaffordable monetary costs. The lack of
sensed locations can be complemented with synthetic data simulations that
further lower the economical investment needed for traffic monitoring. One of
the most common data generative approaches consists of producing real-like
traffic patterns, according to data distributions from analogous roads. The
process of detecting roads with similar traffic is the key point of these
systems. However, without collecting data at the target location no flow
metrics can be employed for this similarity-based search. We present a method
to discover locations among those with available traffic data by inspecting
topological features of road segments. Relevant topological features are
extracted as numerical representations (embeddings) to compare different
locations and eventually find the most similar roads based on the similarity
between their embeddings. The performance of this novel selection system is
examined and compared to simpler traffic estimation approaches. After finding a
similar source of data, a generative method is used to synthesize traffic
profiles. Depending on the resemblance of the traffic behavior at the sensed
road, the generation method can be fed with data from one road only. Several
generation approaches are analyzed in terms of the precision of the synthesized
samples. Above all, this work intends to stimulate further research efforts
towards enhancing the quality of synthetic traffic samples and thereby,
reducing the need for sensing infrastructure.</span>

                    <span>In the context of reinforcement learning we introduce the concept of
criticality of a state, which indicates the extent to which the choice of
action in that particular state influences the expected return. That is, a
state in which the choice of action is more likely to influence the final
outcome is considered as more critical than a state in which it is less likely
to influence the final outcome.

We formulate a criticality-based varying step number algorithm (CVS) - a
flexible step number algorithm that utilizes the criticality function provided
by a human, or learned directly from the environment. We test it in three
different domains including the Atari Pong environment, Road-Tree environment,
and Shooter environment. We demonstrate that CVS is able to outperform popular
learning algorithms such as Deep Q-Learning and Monte Carlo.</span>

using the recently presented SSHIBA model for jointly learning different tasks

inference to impute missing values and combine information of several views.
This way, we can combine different data-views from different time-points in a
common latent space and learn the relations between each time-point while
simultaneously modelling and predicting several output variables. We apply this
model to predict together diagnosis, ventricle volume, and clinical scores in

                    <span>Automatically locating vulnerable statements in source code is crucial to
assure software security and alleviate developers&#x27; debugging efforts. This
becomes even more important in today&#x27;s software ecosystem, where vulnerable
code can flow easily and unwittingly within and across software repositories
like GitHub. Across such millions of lines of code, traditional static and
dynamic approaches struggle to scale. Although existing machine-learning-based
approaches look promising in such a setting, most work detects vulnerable code
at a higher granularity -- at the method or file level. Thus, developers still
need to inspect a significant amount of code to locate the vulnerable
statement(s) that need to be fixed.

This paper presents VELVET, a novel ensemble learning approach to locate
vulnerable statements. Our model combines graph-based and sequence-based neural
networks to successfully capture the local and global context of a program
graph and effectively understand code semantics and vulnerable patterns. To
study VELVET&#x27;s effectiveness, we use an off-the-shelf synthetic dataset and a
recently published real-world dataset. In the static analysis setting, where
vulnerable functions are not detected in advance, VELVET achieves 4.5x better
performance than the baseline static analyzers on the real-world data. For the
isolated vulnerability localization task, where we assume the vulnerability of
a function is known while the specific vulnerable statement is unknown, we
compare VELVET with several neural networks that also attend to local and
global context of code. VELVET achieves 99.6% and 43.6% top-1 accuracy over
synthetic data and real-world data, respectively, outperforming the baseline
deep-learning models by 5.3-29.0%.</span>

                    <span>Unobserved confounding is one of the main challenges when estimating causal
effects. We propose a causal reduction method that, given a causal model,
replaces an arbitrary number of possibly high-dimensional latent confounders
with a single latent confounder that takes values in the same space as the
treatment variable, without changing the observational and interventional
distributions the causal model entails. This allows us to estimate the causal
effect in a principled way from combined data without relying on the common but
often unrealistic assumption that all confounders have been observed. We apply
our causal reduction in three different settings. In the first setting, we
assume the treatment and outcome to be discrete. The causal reduction then
implies bounds between the observational and interventional distributions that
can be exploited for estimation purposes. In certain cases with highly
unbalanced observational samples, the accuracy of the causal effect estimate
can be improved by incorporating observational data. Second, for continuous
variables and assuming a linear-Gaussian model, we derive equality constraints
for the parameters of the observational and interventional distributions.
Third, for the general continuous setting (possibly nonlinear or non-Gaussian),
we parameterize the reduced causal model using normalizing flows, a flexible
class of easily invertible nonlinear transformations. We perform a series of
experiments on synthetic data and find that in several cases the number of
interventional samples can be reduced when adding observational training
samples without sacrificing accuracy.</span>

                    <span>The problem of attacks on neural networks through input modification (i.e.,
adversarial examples) has attracted much attention recently. Being relatively
easy to generate and hard to detect, these attacks pose a security breach that
many suggested defenses try to mitigate. However, the evaluation of the effect
of attacks and defenses commonly relies on traditional classification metrics,
without adequate adaptation to adversarial scenarios. Most of these metrics are
accuracy-based, and therefore may have a limited scope and low distinctive
power. Other metrics do not consider the unique characteristics of neural
networks functionality, or measure the effect of the attacks indirectly (e.g.,
through the complexity of their generation). In this paper, we present two
metrics which are specifically designed to measure the effect of attacks, or
the recovery effect of defenses, on the output of neural networks in multiclass
classification tasks. Inspired by the normalized discounted cumulative gain and
the reciprocal rank metrics used in information retrieval literature, we treat
the neural network predictions as ranked lists of results. Using additional
information about the probability of the rank enabled us to define novel
metrics that are suited to the task at hand. We evaluate our metrics using
various attacks and defenses on a pretrained VGG19 model and the ImageNet
dataset. Compared to the common classification metrics, our proposed metrics
demonstrate superior informativeness and distinctiveness.</span>

                    <span>To alleviate the data requirement for training effective binary classifiers
in binary classification, many weakly supervised learning settings have been
proposed. Among them, some consider using pairwise but not pointwise labels,
when pointwise labels are not accessible due to privacy, confidentiality, or
security reasons. However, as a pairwise label denotes whether or not two data
points share a pointwise label, it cannot be easily collected if either point
is equally likely to be positive or negative. Thus, in this paper, we propose a
novel setting called pairwise comparison (Pcomp) classification, where we have
only pairs of unlabeled data that we know one is more likely to be positive
than the other. Firstly, we give a Pcomp data generation process, derive an
unbiased risk estimator (URE) with theoretical guarantee, and further improve
URE using correction functions. Secondly, we link Pcomp classification to
noisy-label learning to develop a progressive URE and improve it by imposing
consistency regularization. Finally, we demonstrate by experiments the
effectiveness of our methods, which suggests Pcomp is a valuable and
practically useful type of pairwise supervision besides the pairwise label.</span>

                    <span>In the age of neural networks and Internet of Things (IoT), the search for
new neural network architectures capable of operating on devices with limited
computing power and small memory size is becoming an urgent agenda. Designing
suitable algorithms for IoT applications is an important task. The paper
proposes a feed forward LogNNet neural network, which uses a semi-linear Henon
type discrete chaotic map to classify MNIST-10 dataset. The model is composed
of reservoir part and trainable classifier. The aim of the reservoir part is
transforming the inputs to maximize the classification accuracy using a special
matrix filing method and a time series generated by the chaotic map. The
parameters of the chaotic map are optimized using particle swarm optimization
with random immigrants. As a result, the proposed LogNNet/Henon classifier has
higher accuracy and the same RAM usage, compared to the original version of
LogNNet, and offers promising opportunities for implementation in IoT devices.
In addition, a direct relation between the value of entropy and accuracy of the
classification is demonstrated.</span>

                    <span>Understanding the fundamental mechanism behind the success of deep neural
networks is one of the key challenges in the modern machine learning
literature. Despite numerous attempts, a solid theoretical analysis is yet to
be developed. In this paper, we develop a novel unified framework to reveal a
hidden regularization mechanism through the lens of convex optimization. We
first show that the training of multiple three-layer ReLU sub-networks with
weight decay regularization can be equivalently cast as a convex optimization
problem in a higher dimensional space, where sparsity is enforced via a group
$\ell_1$-norm regularization. Consequently, ReLU networks can be interpreted as
high dimensional feature selection methods. More importantly, we then prove
that the equivalent convex problem can be globally optimized by a standard
convex optimization solver with a polynomial-time complexity with respect to
the number of samples and data dimension when the width of the network is
fixed. Finally, we numerically validate our theoretical results via experiments
involving both synthetic and real datasets.</span>

                    <span>We demonstrate, theoretically and empirically, that adversarial robustness
can significantly benefit from semisupervised learning. Theoretically, we
revisit the simple Gaussian model of Schmidt et al. that shows a sample
complexity gap between standard and robust classification. We prove that
unlabeled data bridges this gap: a simple semisupervised learning procedure
(self-training) achieves high robust accuracy using the same number of labels
required for achieving high standard accuracy. Empirically, we augment CIFAR-10
with 500K unlabeled images sourced from 80 Million Tiny Images and use robust
self-training to outperform state-of-the-art robust accuracies by over 5 points
in (i) $\ell_\infty$ robustness against several strong attacks via adversarial
training and (ii) certified $\ell_2$ and $\ell_\infty$ robustness via
randomized smoothing. On SVHN, adding the dataset&#x27;s own extra training set with
the labels removed provides gains of 4 to 10 points, within 1 point of the gain
from using the extra labels.</span>

                    <span>Time-series data are one of the fundamental types of raw data representation
used in data-driven techniques. In machine condition monitoring, time-series
vibration data are overly used in data mining for deep neural networks.
Typically, vibration data is converted into images for classification using
Deep Neural Networks (DNNs), and scalograms are the most effective form of
image representation. However, the DNN classifiers require huge labeled
training samples to reach their optimum performance. So, many forms of data
augmentation techniques are applied to the classifiers to compensate for the
lack of training samples. However, the scalograms are graphical representations
where the existing augmentation techniques suffer because they either change
the graphical meaning or have too much noise in the samples that change the
physical meaning. In this study, a data augmentation technique named ensemble
augmentation is proposed to overcome this limitation. This augmentation method
uses the power of white noise added in ensembles to the original samples to
generate real-like samples. After averaging the signal with ensembles, a new
signal is obtained that contains the characteristics of the original signal.
The parameters for the ensemble augmentation are validated using a simulated
signal. The proposed method is evaluated using 10 class bearing vibration data
using three state-of-the-art Transfer Learning (TL) models, namely,
Inception-V3, MobileNet-V2, and ResNet50. Augmented samples are generated in
two increments: the first increment generates the same number of fake samples
as the training samples, and in the second increment, the number of samples is
increased gradually. The outputs from the proposed method are compared with no
augmentation, augmentations using deep convolution generative adversarial
network (DCGAN), and several geometric transformation-based augmentations...</span>

                    <span>This paper is concerned with the asymptotic distribution of the largest
eigenvalues for some nonlinear random matrix ensemble stemming from the study
of neural networks. More precisely we consider $M&#x3D; \frac{1}{m} YY^\top$ with
$Y&#x3D;f(WX)$ where $W$ and $X$ are random rectangular matrices with i.i.d.
centered entries. This models the data covariance matrix or the Conjugate
Kernel of a single layered random Feed-Forward Neural Network. The function $f$
is applied entrywise and can be seen as the activation function of the neural
network. We show that the largest eigenvalue has the same limit (in
probability) as that of some well-known linear random matrix ensembles. In
particular, we relate the asymptotic limit of the largest eigenvalue for the
nonlinear model to that of an information-plus-noise random matrix,
establishing a possible phase transition depending on the function $f$ and the
distribution of $W$ and $X$. This may be of interest for applications to
machine learning.</span>

                    <span>Cellular providers and data aggregating companies crowdsource celluar signal
strength measurements from user devices to generate signal maps, which can be
used to improve network performance. Recognizing that this data collection may
be at odds with growing awareness of privacy concerns, we consider obfuscating
such data before the data leaves the mobile device. The goal is to increase
privacy such that it is difficult to recover sensitive features from the
obfuscated data (e.g. user ids and user whereabouts), while still allowing
network providers to use the data for improving network services (i.e. create
accurate signal maps). To examine this privacy-utility tradeoff, we identify
privacy and utility metrics and threat models suited to signal strength
measurements. We then obfuscate the measurements using several preeminent
techniques, spanning differential privacy, generative adversarial privacy, and
information-theoretic privacy techniques, in order to benchmark a variety of
promising obfuscation approaches and provide guidance to real-world engineers
who are tasked to build signal maps that protect privacy without hurting
utility. Our evaluation results, based on multiple, diverse, real-world signal
map datasets, demonstrate the feasibility of concurrently achieving adequate
privacy and utility, with obfuscation strategies which use the structure and
intended use of datasets in their design, and target average-case, rather than
worst-case, guarantees.</span>

                    <span>In addition to being extremely non-linear, modern problems require millions
if not billions of parameters to solve or at least to get a good approximation
of the solution, and neural networks are known to assimilate that complexity by
deepening and widening their topology in order to increase the level of
non-linearity needed for a better approximation. However, compact topologies
are always preferred to deeper ones as they offer the advantage of using less
computational units and less parameters. This compacity comes at the price of
reduced non-linearity and thus, of limited solution search space. We propose
the 1-Dimensional Polynomial Neural Network (1DPNN) model that uses automatic
polynomial kernel estimation for 1-Dimensional Convolutional Neural Networks
(1DCNNs) and that introduces a high degree of non-linearity from the first
layer which can compensate the need for deep and/or wide topologies. We show
that this non-linearity enables the model to yield better results with less
computational and spatial complexity than a regular 1DCNN on various
classification and regression problems related to audio signals, even though it
introduces more computational and spatial complexity on a neuronal level. The
experiments were conducted on three publicly available datasets and demonstrate
that, on the problems that were tackled, the proposed model can extract more
relevant information from the data than a 1DCNN in less time and with less
memory.</span>

year to diagnose various retinal diseases, but accurate diagnosis of OCT scans
requires trained ophthalmologists who are still prone to making errors. With
better systems for diagnosis, many cases of vision loss caused by retinal
disease could be entirely avoided. In this work, we develop a novel deep
learning architecture for explainable, accurate classification of retinal
disease which achieves state-of-the-art accuracy. Furthermore, we place an
emphasis on producing both qualitative and quantitative explanations of the
model&#x27;s decisions. Our algorithm produces heatmaps indicating the exact regions
in the OCT scan the model focused on when making its decision. In combination
with an OCT segmentation model, this allows us to produce quantitative
breakdowns of the specific retinal layers the model focused on for later review
by an expert. Our work is the first to produce detailed quantitative
explanations of the model&#x27;s decisions in this way. Our combination of accuracy

                    <span>Collecting labeled data for many important tasks in chemoinformatics is time
consuming and requires expensive experiments. In recent years, machine learning
has been used to learn rich representations of molecules using large scale
unlabeled molecular datasets and transfer the knowledge to solve the more
challenging tasks with limited datasets. Variational autoencoders are one of
the tools that have been proposed to perform the transfer for both chemical
property prediction and molecular generation tasks. In this work we propose a
simple method to improve chemical property prediction performance of machine
learning models by incorporating additional information on correlated molecular
descriptors in the representations learned by variational autoencoders. We
verify the method on three property prediction asks. We explore the impact of
the number of incorporated descriptors, correlation between the descriptors and
the target properties, sizes of the datasets etc. Finally, we show the relation
between the performance of property prediction models and the distance between
property prediction dataset and the larger unlabeled dataset in the

                    <span>We solve a challenging yet practically useful variant of 3D Bin Packing
Problem (3D-BPP). In our problem, the agent has limited information about the
items to be packed into the bin, and an item must be packed immediately after
its arrival without buffering or readjusting. The item&#x27;s placement also
subjects to the constraints of collision avoidance and physical stability. We
formulate this online 3D-BPP as a constrained Markov decision process. To solve
the problem, we propose an effective and easy-to-implement constrained deep
reinforcement learning (DRL) method under the actor-critic framework. In
particular, we introduce a feasibility predictor to predict the feasibility
mask for the placement actions and use it to modulate the action probabilities
output by the actor during training. Such supervisions and transformations to
DRL facilitate the agent to learn feasible policies efficiently. Our method can
also be generalized e.g., with the ability to handle lookahead or items with
different orientations. We have conducted extensive evaluation showing that the
learned policy significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods. A user
study suggests that our method attains a human-level performance.</span>

Variational Autoencoder setting for generative time series modeling. An
object-oriented approach to the code was taken to allow for easier development
and research and all code used in the paper can be found here:
https://github.com/simonmoesorensen/neural-ode-project

The results were initially recreated and the reconstructions compared to a
baseline Long-Short Term Memory AutoEncoder. The model was then extended with a
LSTM encoder and challenged by more complex data consisting of time series in
the form of spring oscillations. The model showed promise, and was able to
reconstruct true trajectories for all complexities of data with a smaller RMSE
than the baseline model. However, it was able to capture the dynamic behavior
of the time series for known data in the decoder but was not able to produce
extrapolations following the true trajectory very well for any of the
complexities of spring data. A final experiment was carried out where the model
was also presented with 68 days of solar power production data, and was able to
reconstruct just as well as the baseline, even when very little data is
available.

Finally, the models training time was compared to the baseline. It was found
that for small amounts of data the NODE method was significantly slower at
training than the baseline, while for larger amounts of data the NODE method
would be equal or faster at training.

The paper is ended with a future work section which describes the many
natural extensions to the work presented in this paper, with examples being
investigating further the importance of input data, including extrapolation in
the baseline model or testing more specific model setups.</span>

                    <span>This paper presents a framework of imitating the principal investor&#x27;s
behavior for optimal pricing and hedging options. We construct a
non-deterministic Markov decision process for modeling stock price change
driven by the principal investor&#x27;s decision making. However, low
signal-to-noise ratio and instability that are inherent in equity markets pose
challenges to determine the state transition (stock price change) after
executing an action (the principal investor&#x27;s decision) as well as decide an
action based on current state (spot price). In order to conquer these
challenges, we resort to a Bayesian deep neural network for computing the
predictive distribution of the state transition led by an action. Additionally,
instead of exploring a state-action relationship to formulate a policy, we seek
for an episode based visible-hidden state-action relationship to
probabilistically imitate the principal investor&#x27;s successive decision making.
Unlike conventional option pricing that employs analytical stochastic processes
or utilizes time series analysis to model and sample underlying stock price
movements, our algorithm simulates stock price paths by imitating the principal
investor&#x27;s behavior which requires no preset probability distribution and fewer
predetermined parameters. Eventually the optimal option price is learned by
reinforcement learning to maximize the cumulative risk-adjusted return of a
dynamically hedged portfolio over simulated price paths.</span>

                    <span>Moment methods are an important means of density estimation, but they are
generally strongly dependent on the choice of feasible functions, which
severely affects the performance. We propose a non-classical parameterization
for density estimation using the sample moments, which does not require the
choice of such functions. The parameterization is induced by the
Kullback-Leibler distance, and the solution of it, which is proved to exist and
be unique subject to simple prior that does not depend on data, can be obtained
by convex optimization. Simulation results show the performance of the proposed
estimator in estimating multi-modal densities which are mixtures of different
types of functions.</span>

                    <span>The paper quantifies the impact of race, poverty, politics, and age on
COVID-19 vaccination rates in counties in the continental US. Both, OLS
regression analysis and Random Forest machine learning algorithms are applied
to quantify factors for county-level vaccination hesitancy. The machine
learning model considers joint effects of variables (race/ethnicity,
partisanship, age, etc.) simultaneously to capture the unique combination of
these factors on the vaccination rate. By implementing a state-of-the-art
Artificial Intelligence Explanations (AIX) algorithm, it is possible to solve
the black box problem with machine learning models and provide answers to the
&quot;how much&quot; question for each measured impact factor in every county. For most
counties, a higher percentage vote for Republicans, a greater African American
population share, and a higher poverty rate lower the vaccination rate. While a
higher Asian population share increases the predicted vaccination rate. The
impact on the vaccination rate from the Hispanic population proportion is
positive in the OLS model, but only positive for counties with a high Hispanic
population (&gt;65%) in the Random Forest model. Both the proportion of seniors
and the one for young people in a county have a significant impact in the OLS
model - positive and negative, respectively. In contrast, the impacts are
ambiguous in the Random Forest model. Because results vary between geographies
and since the AIX algorithm is able to quantify vaccine impacts individually
for each county, this research can be tailored to local communities. An
interactive online mapping dashboard that identifies impact factors for
individual U.S. counties is available at
https://www.cpp.edu/~clange/vacmap.html. It is apparent that the influence of
impact factors is not universally the same across different geographies.</span>

focus future development on increasing its accuracy and robustness. We propose
a novel form of &quot;meta learning&quot; that automatically learns interpretable rules
that characterize the types of errors that a system makes, and demonstrate
these rules&#x27; ability to help understand and improve two NLP systems. Our
approach works by collecting error cases on validation data, extracting
meta-features describing these samples, and finally learning rules that
characterize errors using these features. We apply our approach to VilBERT, for
Visual Question Answering, and RoBERTa, for Common Sense Question Answering.
Our system learns interpretable rules that provide insights into systemic
errors these systems make on the given tasks. Using these insights, we are also
able to &quot;close the loop&quot; and modestly improve performance of these systems.</span>

                    <span>Multistage sequential decision-making scenarios are commonly seen in the
healthcare diagnosis process. In this paper, an active learning-based method is
developed to actively collect only the necessary patient data in a sequential
manner. There are two novelties in the proposed method. First, unlike the
existing ordinal logistic regression model which only models a single stage, we
estimate the parameters for all stages together. Second, it is assumed that the
coefficients for common features in different stages are kept consistent. The
effectiveness of the proposed method is validated in both a simulation study
and a real case study. Compared with the baseline method where the data is
modeled individually and independently, the proposed method improves the
estimation efficiency by 62\%-1838\%. For both simulation and testing cohorts,
the proposed method is more effective, stable, interpretable, and
computationally efficient on parameter estimation. The proposed method can be
easily extended to a variety of scenarios where decision-making can be done
sequentially with only necessary information.</span>

                    <span>Over the recent years, there has been an extensive adoption of Machine
Learning (ML) in a plethora of real-world applications, ranging from computer
vision to data mining and drug discovery. In this paper, we utilize ML to
facilitate efficient film fabrication, specifically Atomic Layer Deposition
(ALD). In order to make advances in ALD process development, which is utilized
to generate thin films, and its subsequent accelerated adoption in industry, it
is imperative to understand the underlying atomistic processes. Towards this
end, in situ techniques for monitoring film growth, such as Spectroscopic
Ellipsometry (SE), have been proposed. However, in situ SE is associated with
complex hardware and, hence, is resource intensive. To address these
challenges, we propose an ML-based approach to expedite film thickness
estimation. The proposed approach has tremendous implications of faster data
acquisition, reduced hardware complexity and easier integration of
spectroscopic ellipsometry for in situ monitoring of film thickness deposition.
Our experimental results involving SE of TiO2 demonstrate that the proposed
ML-based approach furnishes promising thickness prediction accuracy results of
88.76% within +/-1.5 nm and 85.14% within +/-0.5 nm intervals. Furthermore, we
furnish accuracy results up to 98% at lower thicknesses, which is a significant
improvement over existing SE-based analysis, thereby making our solution a
viable option for thickness estimation of ultrathin films.</span>

                    <span>The increasing automation in many areas of the Industry expressly demands to
design efficient machine-learning solutions for the detection of abnormal
events. With the ubiquitous deployment of sensors monitoring nearly
continuously the health of complex infrastructures, anomaly detection can now
rely on measurements sampled at a very high frequency, providing a very rich
representation of the phenomenon under surveillance. In order to exploit fully
the information thus collected, the observations cannot be treated as
multivariate data anymore and a functional analysis approach is required. It is
the purpose of this paper to investigate the performance of recent techniques
for anomaly detection in the functional setup on real datasets. After an
overview of the state-of-the-art and a visual-descriptive study, a variety of
anomaly detection methods are compared. While taxonomies of abnormalities (e.g.
shape, location) in the functional setup are documented in the literature,
assigning a specific type to the identified anomalies appears to be a
challenging task. Thus, strengths and weaknesses of the existing approaches are
benchmarked in view of these highlighted types in a simulation study. Anomaly
detection methods are next evaluated on two datasets, related to the monitoring
of helicopters in flight and to the spectrometry of construction materials
namely. The benchmark analysis is concluded by recommendation guidance for
practitioners.</span>

varieties demand multivariate algorithms to properly detect anomalies. However,
forecast-based algorithms, as widely proven approaches, often perform
sub-optimally or inconsistently across datasets. A key common issue is they
strive to be one-size-fits-all but anomalies are distinctive in nature. We
propose a method that tailors to such distinction. Presenting FMUAD - a
Forecast-based, Multi-aspect, Unsupervised Anomaly Detection framework. FMUAD
explicitly and separately captures the signature traits of anomaly types -
spatial change, temporal change and correlation change - with independent
modules. The modules then jointly learn an optimal feature representation,
which is highly flexible and intuitive, unlike most other models in the
category. Extensive experiments show our FMUAD framework consistently
outperforms other state-of-the-art forecast-based anomaly detectors.</span>

                    <span>Given access to a machine learning model, can an adversary reconstruct the
model&#x27;s training data? This work studies this question from the lens of a
powerful informed adversary who knows all the training data points except one.
By instantiating concrete attacks, we show it is feasible to reconstruct the
remaining data point in this stringent threat model. For convex models (e.g.
logistic regression), reconstruction attacks are simple and can be derived in
closed-form. For more general models (e.g. neural networks), we propose an
attack strategy based on training a reconstructor network that receives as
input the weights of the model under attack and produces as output the target
data point. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our attack on image classifiers
trained on MNIST and CIFAR-10, and systematically investigate which factors of
standard machine learning pipelines affect reconstruction success. Finally, we
theoretically investigate what amount of differential privacy suffices to
mitigate reconstruction attacks by informed adversaries. Our work provides an
effective reconstruction attack that model developers can use to assess
memorization of individual points in general settings beyond those considered
in previous works (e.g. generative language models or access to training
gradients); it shows that standard models have the capacity to store enough
information to enable high-fidelity reconstruction of training data points; and
it demonstrates that differential privacy can successfully mitigate such
attacks in a parameter regime where utility degradation is minimal.</span>

                    <span>Class imbalance occurs in many real-world applications, including image
classification, where the number of images in each class differs significantly.
With imbalanced data, the generative adversarial networks (GANs) leans to
majority class samples. The two recent methods, Balancing GAN (BAGAN) and
improved BAGAN (BAGAN-GP), are proposed as an augmentation tool to handle this
problem and restore the balance to the data. The former pre-trains the
autoencoder weights in an unsupervised manner. However, it is unstable when the
images from different categories have similar features. The latter is improved
based on BAGAN by facilitating supervised autoencoder training, but the
pre-training is biased towards the majority classes. In this work, we propose a
novel Conditional Variational Autoencoder with Balanced Pre-training for
Generative Adversarial Networks (CAPGAN) as an augmentation tool to generate
realistic synthetic images. In particular, we utilize a conditional
convolutional variational autoencoder with supervised and balanced pre-training
for the GAN initialization and training with gradient penalty. Our proposed
method presents a superior performance of other state-of-the-art methods on the
highly imbalanced version of MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, CIFAR-10, and two medical
imaging datasets. Our method can synthesize high-quality minority samples in
terms of Fr\&#x27;echet inception distance, structural similarity index measure and
perceptual quality.</span>

                    <span>Adaptive partial linear beamforming meets the need of 5G and future 6G
applications for high flexibility and adaptability. Choosing an appropriate
tradeoff between conflicting goals opens the recently proposed multiuser (MU)
detection method. Due to their high spatial resolution, nonlinear beamforming
filters can significantly outperform linear approaches in stationary scenarios
with massive connectivity. However, a dramatic decrease in performance can be
expected in high mobility scenarios because they are very susceptible to
changes in the wireless channel. The robustness of linear filters is required,
considering these changes. One way to respond appropriately is to use online
machine learning algorithms. The theory of algorithms based on the adaptive
projected subgradient method (APSM) is rich, and they promise accurate tracking
capabilities in dynamic wireless environments. However, one of the main
challenges comes from the real-time implementation of these algorithms, which
involve projections on time-varying closed convex sets. While the projection
operations are relatively simple, their vast number poses a challenge in
ultralow latency (ULL) applications where latency constraints must be satisfied
in every radio frame. Taking non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) systems as
an example, this paper explores the acceleration of APSM-based algorithms
through massive parallelization. The result is a GPU-accelerated real-time
implementation of an orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM)-based
transceiver that enables detection latency of less than one millisecond and
therefore complies with the requirements of 5G and beyond. To meet the
stringent physical layer latency requirements, careful co-design of hardware
and software is essential, especially in virtualized wireless systems with
hardware accelerators.</span>

                    <span>Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have succeeded in many practical
applications. However, their high computation and storage requirements often
make them difficult to deploy on resource-constrained devices. In order to
tackle this issue, many pruning algorithms have been proposed for CNNs, but
most of them can&#x27;t prune CNNs to a reasonable level. In this paper, we propose
a novel algorithm for training and pruning CNNs based on the recursive least
squares (RLS) optimization. After training a CNN for some epochs, our algorithm
combines inverse input autocorrelation matrices and weight matrices to evaluate
and prune unimportant input channels or nodes layer by layer. Then, our
algorithm will continue to train the pruned network, and won&#x27;t do the next
pruning until the pruned network recovers the full performance of the old
network. Besides for CNNs, the proposed algorithm can be used for feedforward
neural networks (FNNs). Three experiments on MNIST, CIFAR-10 and SVHN datasets

                    <span>Machine learning techniques typically applied to dementia forecasting lack in
their capabilities to jointly learn several tasks, handle time dependent
heterogeneous data and missing values. In this paper, we propose a framework
using the recently presented SSHIBA model for jointly learning different tasks
on longitudinal data with missing values. The method uses Bayesian variational
inference to impute missing values and combine information of several views.
This way, we can combine different data-views from different time-points in a
common latent space and learn the relations between each time-point while
simultaneously modelling and predicting several output variables. We apply this
model to predict together diagnosis, ventricle volume, and clinical scores in
dementia. The results demonstrate that SSHIBA is capable of learning a good
imputation of the missing values and outperforming the baselines while
simultaneously predicting three different tasks.</span>

                    <span>The increasing automation in many areas of the Industry expressly demands to
design efficient machine-learning solutions for the detection of abnormal
events. With the ubiquitous deployment of sensors monitoring nearly
continuously the health of complex infrastructures, anomaly detection can now
rely on measurements sampled at a very high frequency, providing a very rich
representation of the phenomenon under surveillance. In order to exploit fully
the information thus collected, the observations cannot be treated as
multivariate data anymore and a functional analysis approach is required. It is
the purpose of this paper to investigate the performance of recent techniques
for anomaly detection in the functional setup on real datasets. After an
overview of the state-of-the-art and a visual-descriptive study, a variety of
anomaly detection methods are compared. While taxonomies of abnormalities (e.g.
shape, location) in the functional setup are documented in the literature,
assigning a specific type to the identified anomalies appears to be a
challenging task. Thus, strengths and weaknesses of the existing approaches are
benchmarked in view of these highlighted types in a simulation study. Anomaly
detection methods are next evaluated on two datasets, related to the monitoring
of helicopters in flight and to the spectrometry of construction materials
namely. The benchmark analysis is concluded by recommendation guidance for
practitioners.</span>

                    <span>In this paper, we consider the graph alignment problem, which is the problem
of recovering, given two graphs, a one-to-one mapping between nodes that
maximizes edge overlap. This problem can be viewed as a noisy version of the
well-known graph isomorphism problem and appears in many applications,
including social network deanonymization and cellular biology. Our focus here
is on partial recovery, i.e., we look for a one-to-one mapping which is correct
on a fraction of the nodes of the graph rather than on all of them, and we
assume that the two input graphs to the problem are correlated
Erd\H{o}s-R\&#x27;enyi graphs of parameters $(n,q,s)$. Our main contribution is then
to give necessary and sufficient conditions on $(n,q,s)$ under which partial
recovery is possible with high probability as the number of nodes $n$ goes to
infinity. In particular, we show that it is possible to achieve partial
recovery in the $nqs&#x3D;\Theta(1)$ regime under certain additional assumptions.</span>

                    <span>Bulk synchronous parallel (BSP) is the de-facto paradigm for distributed DNN
training in today&#x27;s production clusters. However, due to the global
synchronization nature, its performance can be significantly influenced by
network bottlenecks caused by either static topology heterogeneity or dynamic
bandwidth contentions. Existing solutions, either system-level optimizations
strengthening BSP (e.g., Ring or Hierarchical All-reduce) or algorithmic
optimizations replacing BSP (e.g., ASP or SSP, which relax the global
barriers), do not completely solve the problem, as they may still suffer from
communication inefficiency or risk convergence inaccuracy.

In this paper, we present a novel divide-and-shuffle synchronization
(DS-Sync) to realize communication efficiency without sacrificing convergence
accuracy for distributed DNN training. At its heart, by taking into account the
network bottlenecks, DS-Sync improves communication efficiency by dividing
workers into non-overlap groups to synchronize independently in a
bottleneck-free manner. Meanwhile, it maintains convergence accuracy by
iteratively shuffling workers among different groups to ensure a global
consensus. We theoretically prove that DS-Sync converges properly in non-convex
and smooth conditions like DNN. We further implement DS-Sync and integrate it
with PyTorch, and our testbed experiments show that DS-Sync can achieve up to
$94\%$ improvements on the end-to-end training time with existing solutions
while maintaining the same accuracy.</span>

                    <span>Thanks to their scalability, two-stage recommenders are used by many of
today&#x27;s largest online platforms, including YouTube, LinkedIn, and Pinterest.
These systems produce recommendations in two steps: (i) multiple nominators,
tuned for low prediction latency, preselect a small subset of candidates from
the whole item pool; (ii) a slower but more accurate ranker further narrows
down the nominated items, and serves to the user. Despite their popularity, the
literature on two-stage recommenders is relatively scarce, and the algorithms
are often treated as mere sums of their parts. Such treatment presupposes that
the two-stage performance is explained by the behavior of the individual
components in isolation. This is not the case: using synthetic and real-world
data, we demonstrate that interactions between the ranker and the nominators
substantially affect the overall performance. Motivated by these findings, we
derive a generalization lower bound which shows that independent nominator
training can lead to performance on par with uniformly random recommendations.
We find that careful design of item pools, each assigned to a different
nominator, alleviates these issues. As manual search for a good pool allocation
is difficult, we propose to learn one instead using a Mixture-of-Experts based
approach. This significantly improves both precision and recall at K.</span>

learning algorithms. However, it is computationally expensive to tune all the
tunable hyperparameters simultaneously especially for large data sets. In this
paper, we give a definition of hyperparameter importance that can be estimated
by subsampling procedures. According to the importance, hyperparameters can
then be tuned on the entire data set more efficiently. We show theoretically
that the proposed importance on subsets of data is consistent with the one on
the population data under weak conditions. Numerical experiments show that the
proposed importance is consistent and can save a lot of computational
resources.</span>

                    <span>We solve a challenging yet practically useful variant of 3D Bin Packing
Problem (3D-BPP). In our problem, the agent has limited information about the
items to be packed into the bin, and an item must be packed immediately after
its arrival without buffering or readjusting. The item&#x27;s placement also
subjects to the constraints of collision avoidance and physical stability. We
formulate this online 3D-BPP as a constrained Markov decision process. To solve
the problem, we propose an effective and easy-to-implement constrained deep
reinforcement learning (DRL) method under the actor-critic framework. In
particular, we introduce a feasibility predictor to predict the feasibility
mask for the placement actions and use it to modulate the action probabilities
output by the actor during training. Such supervisions and transformations to
DRL facilitate the agent to learn feasible policies efficiently. Our method can
also be generalized e.g., with the ability to handle lookahead or items with
different orientations. We have conducted extensive evaluation showing that the
learned policy significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods. A user
study suggests that our method attains a human-level performance.</span>

                    <span>Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs) are a natural and
general model in reinforcement learning that take into account the agent&#x27;s
uncertainty about its current state. In the literature on POMDPs, it is
customary to assume access to a planning oracle that computes an optimal policy
when the parameters are known, even though the problem is known to be
computationally hard. Almost all existing planning algorithms either run in
exponential time, lack provable performance guarantees, or require placing
strong assumptions on the transition dynamics under every possible policy. In
this work, we revisit the planning problem and ask: are there natural and
well-motivated assumptions that make planning easy?

Our main result is a quasipolynomial-time algorithm for planning in
(one-step) observable POMDPs. Specifically, we assume that well-separated
distributions on states lead to well-separated distributions on observations,
and thus the observations are at least somewhat informative in each step.
Crucially, this assumption places no restrictions on the transition dynamics of
the POMDP; nevertheless, it implies that near-optimal policies admit
quasi-succinct descriptions, which is not true in general (under standard
hardness assumptions). Our analysis is based on new quantitative bounds for
filter stability -- i.e. the rate at which an optimal filter for the latent
state forgets its initialization. Furthermore, we prove matching hardness for
planning in observable POMDPs under the Exponential Time Hypothesis.</span>

from the joint density. Experiments with Gaussian mixture densities indicate
that the L2 error decreases similarly to kernel herding, while the computation
time is significantly lower, i.e., linear in the number of dimensions.</span>

                    <span>Successful deep learning models often involve training neural network
architectures that contain more parameters than the number of training samples.
Such overparametrized models have been extensively studied in recent years, and
the virtues of overparametrization have been established from both the
statistical perspective, via the double-descent phenomenon, and the
computational perspective via the structural properties of the optimization
landscape.

Despite the remarkable success of deep learning architectures in the
overparametrized regime, it is also well known that these models are highly
vulnerable to small adversarial perturbations in their inputs. Even when
adversarially trained, their performance on perturbed inputs (robust
generalization) is considerably worse than their best attainable performance on
benign inputs (standard generalization). It is thus imperative to understand
how overparametrization fundamentally affects robustness.

In this paper, we will provide a precise characterization of the role of
overparametrization on robustness by focusing on random features regression
models (two-layer neural networks with random first layer weights). We consider
a regime where the sample size, the input dimension and the number of
parameters grow in proportion to each other, and derive an asymptotically exact
formula for the robust generalization error when the model is adversarially
trained. Our developed theory reveals the nontrivial effect of
overparametrization on robustness and indicates that for adversarially trained
random features models, high overparametrization can hurt robust
generalization.</span>

                    <span>Traffic forecasting plays a crucial role in intelligent transportation
systems. The spatial-temporal complexities in transportation networks make the
problem especially challenging. The recently suggested deep learning models
share basic elements such as graph convolution, graph attention, recurrent
units, and/or attention mechanism. In this study, we designed an in-depth
comparative study for four deep neural network models utilizing different basic
elements. For base models, one RNN-based model and one attention-based model
were chosen from previous literature. Then, the spatial feature extraction
layers in the models were substituted with graph convolution and graph
attention. To analyze the performance of each element in various environments,
we conducted experiments on four real-world datasets - highway speed, highway
flow, urban speed from a homogeneous road link network, and urban speed from a
heterogeneous road link network. The results demonstrate that the RNN-based
model and the attention-based model show a similar level of performance for
short-term prediction, and the attention-based model outperforms the RNN in
longer-term predictions. The choice of graph convolution and graph attention
makes a larger difference in the RNN-based models. Also, our modified version
of GMAN shows comparable performance with the original with less memory
consumption.</span>

                    <span>To alleviate the data requirement for training effective binary classifiers
in binary classification, many weakly supervised learning settings have been
proposed. Among them, some consider using pairwise but not pointwise labels,
when pointwise labels are not accessible due to privacy, confidentiality, or
security reasons. However, as a pairwise label denotes whether or not two data
points share a pointwise label, it cannot be easily collected if either point
is equally likely to be positive or negative. Thus, in this paper, we propose a
novel setting called pairwise comparison (Pcomp) classification, where we have
only pairs of unlabeled data that we know one is more likely to be positive
than the other. Firstly, we give a Pcomp data generation process, derive an
unbiased risk estimator (URE) with theoretical guarantee, and further improve
URE using correction functions. Secondly, we link Pcomp classification to
noisy-label learning to develop a progressive URE and improve it by imposing
consistency regularization. Finally, we demonstrate by experiments the
effectiveness of our methods, which suggests Pcomp is a valuable and
practically useful type of pairwise supervision besides the pairwise label.</span>

generally strongly dependent on the choice of feasible functions, which
severely affects the performance. We propose a non-classical parameterization
for density estimation using the sample moments, which does not require the
choice of such functions. The parameterization is induced by the
Kullback-Leibler distance, and the solution of it, which is proved to exist and
be unique subject to simple prior that does not depend on data, can be obtained
by convex optimization. Simulation results show the performance of the proposed

                    <span>Massive data analysis becomes increasingly prevalent, subsampling methods
like BLB (Bag of Little Bootstraps) serves as powerful tools for assessing the
quality of estimators for massive data. However, the performance of the
subsampling methods are highly influenced by the selection of tuning parameters
( e.g., the subset size, number of resamples per subset ). In this article we
develop a hyperparameter selection methodology, which can be used to select
tuning parameters for subsampling methods. Specifically, by a careful
theoretical analysis, we find an analytically simple and elegant relationship
between the asymptotic efficiency of various subsampling estimators and their
hyperparameters. This leads to an optimal choice of the hyperparameters. More
specifically, for an arbitrarily specified hyperparameter set, we can improve
it to be a new set of hyperparameters with no extra CPU time cost, but the
resulting estimator&#x27;s statistical efficiency can be much improved. Both
simulation studies and real data analysis demonstrate the superior advantage of
our method.</span>

                    <span>Understanding the fundamental mechanism behind the success of deep neural
networks is one of the key challenges in the modern machine learning
literature. Despite numerous attempts, a solid theoretical analysis is yet to
be developed. In this paper, we develop a novel unified framework to reveal a
hidden regularization mechanism through the lens of convex optimization. We
first show that the training of multiple three-layer ReLU sub-networks with
weight decay regularization can be equivalently cast as a convex optimization
problem in a higher dimensional space, where sparsity is enforced via a group
$\ell_1$-norm regularization. Consequently, ReLU networks can be interpreted as
high dimensional feature selection methods. More importantly, we then prove
that the equivalent convex problem can be globally optimized by a standard
convex optimization solver with a polynomial-time complexity with respect to
the number of samples and data dimension when the width of the network is
fixed. Finally, we numerically validate our theoretical results via experiments
involving both synthetic and real datasets.</span>

                    <span>We demonstrate, theoretically and empirically, that adversarial robustness
can significantly benefit from semisupervised learning. Theoretically, we
revisit the simple Gaussian model of Schmidt et al. that shows a sample
complexity gap between standard and robust classification. We prove that
unlabeled data bridges this gap: a simple semisupervised learning procedure
(self-training) achieves high robust accuracy using the same number of labels
required for achieving high standard accuracy. Empirically, we augment CIFAR-10
with 500K unlabeled images sourced from 80 Million Tiny Images and use robust
self-training to outperform state-of-the-art robust accuracies by over 5 points
in (i) $\ell_\infty$ robustness against several strong attacks via adversarial
training and (ii) certified $\ell_2$ and $\ell_\infty$ robustness via
randomized smoothing. On SVHN, adding the dataset&#x27;s own extra training set with
the labels removed provides gains of 4 to 10 points, within 1 point of the gain
from using the extra labels.</span>

                    <span>Multistage sequential decision-making scenarios are commonly seen in the
healthcare diagnosis process. In this paper, an active learning-based method is
developed to actively collect only the necessary patient data in a sequential
manner. There are two novelties in the proposed method. First, unlike the
existing ordinal logistic regression model which only models a single stage, we
estimate the parameters for all stages together. Second, it is assumed that the
coefficients for common features in different stages are kept consistent. The
effectiveness of the proposed method is validated in both a simulation study
and a real case study. Compared with the baseline method where the data is
modeled individually and independently, the proposed method improves the
estimation efficiency by 62\%-1838\%. For both simulation and testing cohorts,
the proposed method is more effective, stable, interpretable, and
computationally efficient on parameter estimation. The proposed method can be
easily extended to a variety of scenarios where decision-making can be done
sequentially with only necessary information.</span>

performance-critical settings. Building on prior theoretical insights from

loss with a contrastive objective over a varied set of appropriately

Finally we show that despite using ResNet encoders, ReLICv2 is comparable to
state-of-the-art self-supervised vision transformers.</span>

                    <span>Neyman-Scott process (NSP) are point process models that generate clusters of
points in time or space. They are natural models for a wide range of phenomena,
ranging from neural spike trains to document streams. The clustering property
is achieved via a doubly stochastic formulation: first, a set of latent events
is drawn from a Poisson process; then, each latent event generates a set of
observed data points according to another Poisson process. This construction is
similar to Bayesian nonparametric mixture models like the Dirichlet process
mixture model (DPMM) in that the number of latent events (i.e. clusters) is a
random variable, but the point process formulation makes the NSP especially
well suited to modeling spatiotemporal data. While many specialized algorithms
have been developed for DPMMs, comparatively fewer works have focused on
inference in NSPs. Here, we present novel connections between NSPs and DPMMs,
with the key link being a third class of Bayesian mixture models called mixture
of finite mixture models (MFMMs). Leveraging this connection, we adapt the
standard collapsed Gibbs sampling algorithm for DPMMs to enable scalable
Bayesian inference on NSP models. We demonstrate the potential of Neyman-Scott
processes on a variety of applications including sequence detection in neural
spike trains and event detection in document streams.</span>

                    <span>In this paper, we investigate the question: Given a small number of
datapoints, for example N &#x3D; 30, how tight can PAC-Bayes and test set bounds be
made? For such small datasets, test set bounds adversely affect generalisation
performance by withholding data from the training procedure. In this setting,
PAC-Bayes bounds are especially attractive, due to their ability to use all the
data to simultaneously learn a posterior and bound its generalisation risk. We
focus on the case of i.i.d. data with a bounded loss and consider the generic
PAC-Bayes theorem of Germain et al. While their theorem is known to recover
many existing PAC-Bayes bounds, it is unclear what the tightest bound derivable
from their framework is. For a fixed learning algorithm and dataset, we show
that the tightest possible bound coincides with a bound considered by Catoni;
and, in the more natural case of distributions over datasets, we establish a
lower bound on the best bound achievable in expectation. Interestingly, this
lower bound recovers the Chernoff test set bound if the posterior is equal to
the prior. Moreover, to illustrate how tight these bounds can be, we study
synthetic one-dimensional classification tasks in which it is feasible to
meta-learn both the prior and the form of the bound to numerically optimise for
the tightest bounds possible. We find that in this simple, controlled scenario,
PAC-Bayes bounds are competitive with comparable, commonly used Chernoff test
set bounds. However, the sharpest test set bounds still lead to better
guarantees on the generalisation error than the PAC-Bayes bounds we consider.</span>

                    <span>We study the dynamics of a neural network in function space when optimizing
the mean squared error via gradient flow. We show that in the
underparameterized regime the network learns eigenfunctions of an integral
operator $T_{K^\infty}$ determined by the Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) at rates
corresponding to their eigenvalues. For example, for uniformly distributed data
on the sphere $S^{d - 1}$ and rotation invariant weight distributions, the
eigenfunctions of $T_{K^\infty}$ are the spherical harmonics. Our results can
be understood as describing a spectral bias in the underparameterized regime.
The proofs use the concept of &quot;Damped Deviations&quot;, where deviations of the NTK
matter less for eigendirections with large eigenvalues due to the occurence of
a damping factor. Aside from the underparameterized regime, the damped
deviations point-of-view can be used to track the dynamics of the empirical
risk in the overparameterized setting, allowing us to extend certain results in
the literature. We conclude that damped deviations offers a simple and unifying
perspective of the dynamics when optimizing the squared error.</span>

                    <span>Many statistical machine approaches could ultimately highlight novel features
of the etiology of complex diseases by analyzing multi-omics data. However,
they are sensitive to some deviations in distribution when the observed samples
are potentially contaminated with adversarial corrupted outliers (e.g., a
fictional data distribution). Likewise, statistical advances lag in supporting
comprehensive data-driven analyses of complex multi-omics data integration. We
propose a novel non-linear M-estimator-based approach, &quot;robust kernel machine
regression (RobKMR),&quot; to improve the robustness of statistical machine
regression and the diversity of fictional data to examine the higher-order
composite effect of multi-omics datasets. We address a robust kernel-centered
Gram matrix to estimate the model parameters accurately. We also propose a
robust score test to assess the marginal and joint Hadamard product of features
from multi-omics data. We apply our proposed approach to a multi-omics dataset
of osteoporosis (OP) from Caucasian females. Experiments demonstrate that the
proposed approach effectively identifies the inter-related risk factors of OP.

analysis, causal inference, and drug repurposing, the selected three triplets

                    <span>The COVID-19 pandemic has emphasized the need for a robust understanding of
epidemic models. Current models of epidemics are classified as either
mechanistic or non-mechanistic: mechanistic models make explicit assumptions on
the dynamics of disease, whereas non-mechanistic models make assumptions on the
form of observed time series. Here, we introduce a simple mixture-based model
which bridges the two approaches while retaining benefits of both. The model
represents time series of cases and fatalities as a mixture of Gaussian curves,
providing a flexible function class to learn from data compared to traditional
mechanistic models. Although the model is non-mechanistic, we show that it
arises as the natural outcome of a stochastic process based on a networked SIR
framework. This allows learned parameters to take on a more meaningful
interpretation compared to similar non-mechanistic models, and we validate the
interpretations using auxiliary mobility data collected during the COVID-19
pandemic. We provide a simple learning algorithm to identify model parameters
and establish theoretical results which show the model can be efficiently
learned from data. Empirically, we find the model to have low prediction error.
The model is available live at covidpredictions.mit.edu. Ultimately, this
allows us to systematically understand the impacts of interventions on
COVID-19, which is critical in developing data-driven solutions to controlling
epidemics.</span>

                    <span>Understanding the operation of biological and artificial networks remains a
difficult and important challenge. To identify general principles, researchers
are increasingly interested in surveying large collections of networks that are
trained on, or biologically adapted to, similar tasks. A standardized set of
analysis tools is now needed to identify how network-level covariates -- such
as architecture, anatomical brain region, and model organism -- impact neural
representations (hidden layer activations). Here, we provide a rigorous
foundation for these analyses by defining a broad family of metric spaces that
quantify representational dissimilarity. Using this framework we modify
existing representational similarity measures based on canonical correlation
analysis to satisfy the triangle inequality, formulate a novel metric that
respects the inductive biases in convolutional layers, and identify approximate
Euclidean embeddings that enable network representations to be incorporated
into essentially any off-the-shelf machine learning method. We demonstrate
these methods on large-scale datasets from biology (Allen Institute Brain
Observatory) and deep learning (NAS-Bench-101). In doing so, we identify
relationships between neural representations that are interpretable in terms of
anatomical features and model performance.</span>

                    <span>In this work, we study a variant of nonnegative matrix factorization where we
wish to find a symmetric factorization of a given input matrix into a sparse,
Boolean matrix. Formally speaking, given $\mathbf{M}\in\mathbb{Z}^{m\times m}$,
we want to find $\mathbf{W}\in\{0,1\}^{m\times r}$ such that $\| \mathbf{M} -
\mathbf{W}\mathbf{W}^\top \|_0$ is minimized among all $\mathbf{W}$ for which
each row is $k$-sparse. This question turns out to be closely related to a
number of questions like recovering a hypergraph from its line graph, as well
as reconstruction attacks for private neural network training.

As this problem is hard in the worst-case, we study a natural average-case
variant that arises in the context of these reconstruction attacks: $\mathbf{M}
&#x3D; \mathbf{W}\mathbf{W}^{\top}$ for $\mathbf{W}$ a random Boolean matrix with
$k$-sparse rows, and the goal is to recover $\mathbf{W}$ up to column
permutation. Equivalently, this can be thought of as recovering a uniformly
random $k$-uniform hypergraph from its line graph.

Our main result is a polynomial-time algorithm for this problem based on
bootstrapping higher-order information about $\mathbf{W}$ and then decomposing
an appropriate tensor. The key ingredient in our analysis, which may be of
independent interest, is to show that such a matrix $\mathbf{W}$ has full
column rank with high probability as soon as $m &#x3D; \widetilde{\Omega}(r)$, which
we do using tools from Littlewood-Offord theory and estimates for binary
Krawtchouk polynomials.</span>

                    <span>Adaptive partial linear beamforming meets the need of 5G and future 6G
applications for high flexibility and adaptability. Choosing an appropriate
tradeoff between conflicting goals opens the recently proposed multiuser (MU)
detection method. Due to their high spatial resolution, nonlinear beamforming
filters can significantly outperform linear approaches in stationary scenarios
with massive connectivity. However, a dramatic decrease in performance can be
expected in high mobility scenarios because they are very susceptible to
changes in the wireless channel. The robustness of linear filters is required,
considering these changes. One way to respond appropriately is to use online
machine learning algorithms. The theory of algorithms based on the adaptive
projected subgradient method (APSM) is rich, and they promise accurate tracking
capabilities in dynamic wireless environments. However, one of the main
challenges comes from the real-time implementation of these algorithms, which
involve projections on time-varying closed convex sets. While the projection
operations are relatively simple, their vast number poses a challenge in
ultralow latency (ULL) applications where latency constraints must be satisfied
in every radio frame. Taking non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) systems as
an example, this paper explores the acceleration of APSM-based algorithms
through massive parallelization. The result is a GPU-accelerated real-time
implementation of an orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM)-based
transceiver that enables detection latency of less than one millisecond and
therefore complies with the requirements of 5G and beyond. To meet the
stringent physical layer latency requirements, careful co-design of hardware
and software is essential, especially in virtualized wireless systems with
hardware accelerators.</span>

                    <span>We study an online learning problem subject to the constraint of individual
fairness, which requires that similar individuals are treated similarly. Unlike
prior work on individual fairness, we do not assume the similarity measure
among individuals is known, nor do we assume that such measure takes a certain
parametric form. Instead, we leverage the existence of an auditor who detects
fairness violations without enunciating the quantitative measure. In each
round, the auditor examines the learner&#x27;s decisions and attempts to identify a
pair of individuals that are treated unfairly by the learner. We provide a
general reduction framework that reduces online classification in our model to
standard online classification, which allows us to leverage existing online
learning algorithms to achieve sub-linear regret and number of fairness
violations. Surprisingly, in the stochastic setting where the data are drawn
independently from a distribution, we are also able to establish PAC-style
fairness and accuracy generalization guarantees (Yona and Rothblum [2018]),
despite only having access to a very restricted form of fairness feedback. Our
fairness generalization bound qualitatively matches the uniform convergence
bound of Yona and Rothblum [2018], while also providing a meaningful accuracy
generalization guarantee. Our results resolve an open question by Gillen et al.
[2018] by showing that online learning under an unknown individual fairness
constraint is possible even without assuming a strong parametric form of the
underlying similarity measure.</span>

                    <span>Unobserved confounding is one of the main challenges when estimating causal
effects. We propose a causal reduction method that, given a causal model,
replaces an arbitrary number of possibly high-dimensional latent confounders
with a single latent confounder that takes values in the same space as the
treatment variable, without changing the observational and interventional
distributions the causal model entails. This allows us to estimate the causal
effect in a principled way from combined data without relying on the common but
often unrealistic assumption that all confounders have been observed. We apply
our causal reduction in three different settings. In the first setting, we
assume the treatment and outcome to be discrete. The causal reduction then
implies bounds between the observational and interventional distributions that
can be exploited for estimation purposes. In certain cases with highly
unbalanced observational samples, the accuracy of the causal effect estimate
can be improved by incorporating observational data. Second, for continuous
variables and assuming a linear-Gaussian model, we derive equality constraints
for the parameters of the observational and interventional distributions.
Third, for the general continuous setting (possibly nonlinear or non-Gaussian),
we parameterize the reduced causal model using normalizing flows, a flexible
class of easily invertible nonlinear transformations. We perform a series of
experiments on synthetic data and find that in several cases the number of
interventional samples can be reduced when adding observational training
samples without sacrificing accuracy.</span>

                    <span>We propose a novel stochastic network model, called Fractal Gaussian Network
(FGN), that embodies well-defined and analytically tractable fractal
structures. Such fractal structures have been empirically observed in diverse
applications. FGNs interpolate continuously between the popular purely random
geometric graphs (a.k.a. the Poisson Boolean network), and random graphs with
increasingly fractal behavior. In fact, they form a parametric family of sparse
random geometric graphs that are parametrized by a fractality parameter which
governs the strength of the fractal structure. FGNs are driven by the latent
spatial geometry of Gaussian Multiplicative Chaos (GMC), a canonical model of
fractality in its own right. We asymptotically characterize the expected number
of edges, triangles, cliques and hub-and-spoke motifs in FGNs, unveiling a
distinct pattern in their scaling with the size parameter of the network. We
then examine the natural question of detecting the presence of fractality and
the problem of parameter estimation based on observed network data, in addition
to fundamental properties of the FGN as a random graph model. We also explore
fractality in community structures by unveiling a natural stochastic block
model in the setting of FGNs. Finally, we substantiate our results with
phenomenological analysis of the FGN in the context of available scientific
literature for fractality in networks, including applications to real-world
massive network data.</span>

                    <span>AI is used for various speech recognition and understanding activities, ranging from enabling smart speakers to designing aids for persons who are deaf or have speech impairments. However, these speech comprehension algorithms frequently fail to perform well in everyday scenarios where we need them the most: when numerous people speak simultaneously or when there is a lot of background noise. Even advanced noise-canceling techniques are frequently ineffective against, for instance, the sound of the ocean on a beach trip or the background chatter of a noisy street market.
 Humans interpret speech better than AI in these situations because we use both our ears and our sight. For example, we could watch someone’s mouth move and intuitively know the voice we’re hearing is coming from her. That is why Meta AI is developing new conversational AI systems that, like us, can discern intricate relationships between what they see and what they hear in conversation.

 There is 1 book in b-ok.org but some guy has just posted the google books preview pdf of this book.
 lol.
 If you studied artificial intelligence/soft computing/neural networks in university can you share your book you used to pass university exam questions? I am from Nepal and our syllabus is copied from those Indian university colleges. So having their book would be helpful. But the thing is that Indian author&#x27;s textbook are not available in Nepal lol.

                    <span>Hi there. I&#x27;ve been interested in evolutionary strategies for a while, and OpenAI&#x27;s paper on them shows that they can be a pretty interesting alternative to RL. Now that I&#x27;ve worked with JAX a bit, I decided to put together a tutorial showcasing how I used its vectorization and parallelization to implement evolution pretty easily and get good performance on GPU/TPU devices. 
 https://github.com/ttt733/nn-evolution-jax/blob/main/tutorial.md
 This isn&#x27;t a tutorial on achieving results on an interesting task, but I just wanted to write about an optimization technique I think is somewhat overlooked. The focus is on walking through how I used JAX&#x27;s functions to implement it. I don&#x27;t go into the math behind evolutionary strategies because there are already lots of articles on particular strategies (like CMA-ES) and their performance, how they work, etc. I just use the simplistic strategies OpenAI called out in their post and used in their MuJoCo-solving code - you&#x27;re free to experiment with more complex ones. And, if you know JAX better than I do, please feel free to correct me on anything I got wrong. (I know some of the vectorization stuff can get weird, so there&#x27;s a chance that I vmap&#x27;d a little too aggressively.)
 Hope you enjoy!

                    <span>Recently have been struck by the fact that the two most powerful machine learning methods, neural networks and genetic algorithms, are partly just copied from nature (in concept at least, obviously was a ton of work by a lot of brilliant people). I guess there is a lot of machine learning that is basically just memorization or math but are there any other deep learning algorithm paradigms out there? Do you think there could be someday?

                    <span>Wondering if there&#x27;s an open-source implementation of the Retrieval-Enhanced Transformer (RETRO) [arxiv link]?
 I imagine that it may take some time to make its way to production libraries like Huggingface Transformers due to the external memory component. Anyone heard of people working on this?

                    <span>Over winter break I started poking around online for ways to track dog poop in my backyard. I don&#x27;t like having to walk around and hope I picked up all of it. Where I live it snows a lot, and poops get lost in the snow come new snowfall. I found some cool concept gadgets that people have made, but nothing that worked with just a security cam. So I built this poop detector and made a video about it. When some code I wrote detects my dog pooping it will remember the location and draw a circle where my dog pooped on a picture of my backyard.
 So over the course of a couple of months I have a bunch of circle on a picture of my backyard, where all my dog&#x27;s poops are. So this coming spring I will know where to look!
 Check out the video if you care: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;uWZu3rnj-kQ
 Figured I would share here, it was fun to work on. Is this something you would hook up to a security camera if it was simple? Curious.
 Also, check out DeepLabCut. My project wouldn&#x27;t have been possible without it, and it&#x27;s really cool: https://github.com/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut

Abstract Recent image generation models show remarkable generation performance. However, they mirror strong location preference in datasets, which we call spatial bias. Therefore, generators render poor samples at unseen locations and scales. We argue that the generators rely on their implicit positional encoding to render spatial content. From our observations, the generator’s implicit positional encoding is translation-variant, making the generator spatially biased. To address this issue, we propose injecting explicit positional encoding at each scale of the generator. By learning the spatially unbiased generator, we facilitate the robust use of generators in multiple tasks, such as GAN inversion, multi-scale generation, generation of arbitrary sizes and aspect ratios. Furthermore, we show that our method can also be applied to denoising diffusion probabilistic models.

 ​
 But the books that I am looking for is this-:
 ​
 [https://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Neural-Networks-Matlab-6-0/dp/0070591121](https://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Neural-Networks-Matlab-6-0/dp/0070591121)

 ​
 There is 1 book in [b-ok.org](https://b-ok.org) but some guy has just posted the google books preview pdf of this book.
 ​
 lol.
 ​
 **If you studied artificial intelligence/soft computing/neural networks in university can you share your book you used to pass university exam questions? I am from Nepal and our syllabus is copied from those Indian university colleges. So having their book would be helpful. But the thing is that Indian author&#x27;s textbook are not available in Nepal lol.**

                    <span>Hi !
 I m looking for some advices. I created a custom gym environement and ran it with stable baseline&#x27;s PPO.
 My environement is rather simple I believe. Its a 2d Space with two dots in it. One dot is the agent ( blue dot)
 Another dot (red) is freely travelling vertically or horizontally (randomly selected at env init).
 The goal is to catch the red dot. The episode is considered done when the distance between both dot is under a small value.
 The observation space is continuous (x / y between 0 and 1)
 The action space is discrete ( up down left right) 
 demo
 The agent is rather good at &quot;chasing&quot; but not good at &quot;planning&quot;.
 For example it could position itself on the inbound trajectory of the red dot to &quot;intercept&quot; it but it fails to do so.
 Any idea how to get to that behavior ?
 Code

 Thanks for advices !

                    <span>I am working with an environment with a continuous action space. The agent needs to output 4 continuous values for the action space. I&#x27;m using REINFORCE, so I built a small net that, given a (31,)-sized observation space, outputs a 4x1 vector (https://www.pettingzoo.ml/sisl/multiwalker).
 My loss is:
 loss&#x3D; -torch.sum(torch.log(prob_batch)*expected_returns_batch) 
 So it requires an array of action probabilities for the actions that were taken and the discounted rewards. For this reason, I recomputes the action probabilities for all the states in the trajectory and subsets the action-probabilities associated with the actions that were actually taken with the following two lines of code:
  pred_batch &#x3D; model(state_batch) 
 prob_batch &#x3D; pred_batch.gather(dim&#x3D;1,index&#x3D;action_batch .long().view(-1,1)).squeeze()
 However, I receive this error:
  RuntimeError: Size does not match at dimension 0 expected index [1116, 1] to be smaller than self [279, 4] apart from dimension 1 
 So the problem seems to be that the agent emits four actions at each time step, but the code expects one action only (1116 is indeed four times bigger than 279). How do I fix this?
 Thanks!

                    <span>Hi all,

 The reason why I&#x27;m getting confused is that, if the possible actions were 4 and the agent had to select 1, I could use that probability distribution to choose the one with the highest value. However, here the agent needs to output a 4x1 action space, so I&#x27;m not sure how to use the probability distribution. 
 Thanks!

                    <span>Hi everyone, I have a gym environment where there are multiple units controlled by a single agent. These units can also create new units and the units may also die. Since the number of units may vary, I am wondering how to make an action space if my Agent have to take actions for each units in a single step.

                    <span>Hi, so I&#x27;m developing an RL algorithm, and I have a problem what to choosing Rainbow or PPO. According to Sutton and Barto&#x27;s book, the DQN fails to learn a stochastic policy i.e. while in the state or observation &#x27;s&#x27; acting optimally would be taking action a1 with 60% probability and taking action b with 40 probability. Now since the DQN outputs always the optimal action (based on its value) and not the distribution of action probabilities I see that DQN can&#x27;t learn optimal stochastic policy?
 I&#x27;m unfamiliar with Rainbow implementation, but does it solve that problem of DQN learning deterministic policy?

                    <span>I am training BipedalWalker-v3 agent with PPO algorithm and I cant get my agent to get reward 300 or higher.
 I implemented basic PPO with several upgrades:
  
GAE
 Normalized advantage
 Value Function Loss Clipping
 Overall Loss Includes Entropy Loss
 Adam Learning Rate Annealing
 Mini-batch Updates
 The Epsilon Parameter of Adam Optimizer set to 1e-5
 Normalize and clip observation
 Scale and clip reward
 One NN for policy, one for critic
  
Results I get are shown in table below where Y axis is reward, X is one step (2048 steps, 10 updates). 
 https://preview.redd.it/kf7jpy9qfub81.png?width&#x3D;1710&amp;format&#x3D;png&amp;auto&#x3D;webp&amp;s&#x3D;784e49af512ae2e8534152461ff251de701dee48
 I get really close, but never to over 300. Let alone average 300 reward over 100 episodes which is the goal.
 I tried to tune my hyperparameters but wasn&#x27;t successful. I can provide other graphs, like policy loss, critic loss or mean 100 reward if that helps, but I need help to read these graphs so I can change my hyperparamaters or maybe implementation.
 Best i managed was reward of 300.1 in one step (and never again) and mean reward of 282 when test process tested NNs for 100 episodes.

                    <span>I&#x27;m wondering if their code used V2 or V3. I will ask them if no one here knows, but I thought I would be faster to ask here.
 Apparently V2 had a pretty terrible bug with the LIDARs, so I don&#x27;t want to reuse POET&#x27;s code before making sure they used the right version
 Thanks!

                    <span>Hi,
 Just wondering if anyone has come across a formal definition for episodic tasks in reinforcement learning? Sutton&#x27;s (excellent) book talks about episodic tasks but seems to not formally define them. The questions I&#x27;m trying to answer are:
 (1) does episodic imply episodes are time-limited to some (known) length H (one author uses this)? 
 (2) Does it just imply termination in a finite (but arbitarly large) number of steps?
 (3) Does it imply neither of these?
 My thinking is that ergodic + at least one terminal state + a finite number of states implies 2 (but an infinite number of states does not). 
 Thanks

                    <span>The paper deals with the distribution of singular values of the input-output
Jacobian of deep untrained neural networks in the limit of their infinite
width. The Jacobian is the product of random matrices where the independent
rectangular weight matrices alternate with diagonal matrices whose entries
depend on the corresponding column of the nearest neighbor weight matrix. The
problem was considered in \cite{Pe-Co:18} for the Gaussian weights and biases
and also for the weights that are Haar distributed orthogonal matrices and
Gaussian biases. Basing on a free probability argument, it was claimed that in
these cases the singular value distribution of the Jacobian in the limit of
infinite width (matrix size) coincides with that of the analog of the Jacobian
with special random but weight independent diagonal matrices, the case well
known in random matrix theory. The claim was rigorously proved in
\cite{Pa-Sl:21} for a quite general class of weights and biases with i.i.d.
(including Gaussian) entries by using a version of the techniques of random
matrix theory. In this paper we use another version of the techniques to
justify the claim for random Haar distributed weight matrices and Gaussian
biases.</span>

                    <span>Deep learning techniques for separating audio into different sound sources
face several challenges. Standard architectures require training separate
models for different types of audio sources. Although some universal separators
employ a single model to target multiple sources, they have difficulty
generalizing to unseen sources. In this paper, we propose a three-component
pipeline to train a universal audio source separator from a large, but
weakly-labeled dataset: AudioSet. First, we propose a transformer-based sound
event detection system for processing weakly-labeled training data. Second, we
devise a query-based audio separation model that leverages this data for model
training. Third, we design a latent embedding processor to encode queries that
specify audio targets for separation, allowing for zero-shot generalization.
Our approach uses a single model for source separation of multiple sound types,
and relies solely on weakly-labeled data for training. In addition, the
proposed audio separator can be used in a zero-shot setting, learning to
separate types of audio sources that were never seen in training. To evaluate
the separation performance, we test our model on MUSDB18, while training on the
disjoint AudioSet. We further verify the zero-shot performance by conducting
another experiment on audio source types that are held-out from training. The
model achieves comparable Source-to-Distortion Ratio (SDR) performance to
current supervised models in both cases.</span>

handle complex noisy labels. However, OSAMTL is not suitable for the situation
where diverse noisy samples (DNS) are provided for a learning task. In this
paper, giving definition of DNS, we propose one-step abductive multi-target

of tasks that handle complex noisy labels. Applying OSAMTL-DNS to tumour
segmentation for breast cancer in medical histopathology whole slide image

                    <span>The field of cardiac electrophysiology tries to abstract, describe and
finally model the electrical characteristics of a heartbeat. With recent
advances in cardiac electrophysiology, models have become more powerful and
descriptive as ever. However, to advance to the field of inverse
electrophysiological modeling, i.e. creating models from electrical
measurements such as the ECG, the less investigated field of smoothness of the
simulated ECGs w.r.t. model parameters need to be further explored. The present
paper discusses smoothness in terms of the whole pipeline which describes how
from physiological parameters, we arrive at the simulated ECG. Employing such a
pipeline, we create a test-bench of a simplified idealized left ventricle model
and demonstrate the most important factors for efficient inverse modeling
through smooth cost functionals. Such knowledge will be important for designing
and creating inverse models in future optimization and machine learning
methods.</span>

                    <span>Applying standard machine learning approaches for classification can produce
unequal results across different demographic groups. When then used in
real-world settings, these inequities can have negative societal impacts. This
has motivated the development of various approaches to fair classification with
machine learning models in recent years. In this paper, we consider the problem
of modifying the predictions of a blackbox machine learning classifier in order
to achieve fairness in a multiclass setting. To accomplish this, we extend the
&#x27;post-processing&#x27; approach in Hardt et al. 2016, which focuses on fairness for
binary classification, to the setting of fair multiclass classification. We
explore when our approach produces both fair and accurate predictions through
systematic synthetic experiments and also evaluate discrimination-fairness
tradeoffs on several publicly available real-world application datasets. We
find that overall, our approach produces minor drops in accuracy and enforces
fairness when the number of individuals in the dataset is high relative to the
number of classes and protected groups.</span>

                    <span>Non-parametric, additive models are able to capture complex data dependencies
in a flexible, yet interpretable way. However, choosing the format of the
additive components often requires non-trivial data exploration. Here, as an
alternative, we propose PrAda-net, a one-hidden-layer neural network, trained
with proximal gradient descent and adaptive lasso. PrAda-net automatically
adjusts the size and architecture of the neural network to reflect the
complexity and structure of the data. The compact network obtained by PrAda-net
can be translated to additive model components, making it suitable for
non-parametric statistical modelling with automatic model selection. We
demonstrate PrAda-net on simulated data, where wecompare the test error
performance, variable importance and variable subset identification properties
of PrAda-net to other lasso-based regularization approaches for neural
networks. We also apply PrAda-net to the massive U.K. black smoke data set, to
demonstrate how PrAda-net can be used to model complex and heterogeneous data
with spatial and temporal components. In contrast to classical, statistical
non-parametric approaches, PrAda-net requires no preliminary modeling to select
the functional forms of the additive components, yet still results in an
interpretable model representation.</span>

                    <span>Existing explanation methods for black-box supervised learning models
generally work by building local models that explain the models behaviour for a
particular data item. It is possible to make global explanations, but the
explanations may have low fidelity for complex models. Most of the prior work
on explainable models has been focused on classification problems, with less
attention on regression.

We propose a new manifold visualization method, SLISEMAP, that at the same
time finds local explanations for all of the data items and builds a
two-dimensional visualization of model space such that the data items explained
by the same model are projected nearby. We provide an open source
implementation of our methods, implemented by using GPU-optimized PyTorch
library. SLISEMAP works both on classification and regression models.

We compare SLISEMAP to most popular dimensionality reduction methods and some
local explanation methods. We provide mathematical derivation of our problem
and show that SLISEMAP provides fast and stable visualizations that can be used
to explain and understand black box regression and classification models.</span>

                    <span>The classical statistical learning theory says that fitting too many
parameters leads to overfitting and poor performance. That modern deep neural
networks generalize well despite a large number of parameters contradicts this
finding and constitutes a major unsolved problem towards explaining the success
of deep learning. The implicit regularization induced by stochastic gradient
descent (SGD) has been regarded to be important, but its specific principle is
still unknown. In this work, we study how the local geometry of the energy
landscape around local minima affects the statistical properties of SGD with
Gaussian gradient noise. We argue that under reasonable assumptions, the local
geometry forces SGD to stay close to a low dimensional subspace and that this
induces implicit regularization and results in tighter bounds on the
generalization error for deep neural networks. To derive generalization error
bounds for neural networks, we first introduce a notion of stagnation sets
around the local minima and impose a local essential convexity property of the
population risk. Under these conditions, lower bounds for SGD to remain in
these stagnation sets are derived. If stagnation occurs, we derive a bound on
the generalization error of deep neural networks involving the spectral norms
of the weight matrices but not the number of network parameters. Technically,
our proofs are based on controlling the change of parameter values in the SGD
iterates and local uniform convergence of the empirical loss functions based on
the entropy of suitable neighborhoods around local minima. Our work attempts to
better connect non-convex optimization and generalization analysis with uniform
convergence.</span>

                    <span>Statistical tests for dataset shift are susceptible to false alarms: they are
sensitive to minor differences when there is in fact adequate sample coverage
and predictive performance. We propose instead a framework to detect adverse
dataset shifts based on outlier scores, $\texttt{D-SOS}$ for short.
$\texttt{D-SOS}$ holds that the new (test) sample is not substantively worse
than the reference (training) sample, and not that the two are equal. The key
idea is to reduce observations to outlier scores and compare contamination
rates at varying weighted thresholds. Users can define what $\it{worse}$ means
in terms of relevant notions of outlyingness, including proxies for predictive
performance. Compared to tests of equal distribution, our approach is uniquely
tailored to serve as a robust metric for model monitoring and data validation.
We show how versatile and practical $\texttt{D-SOS}$ is on a wide range of real
and simulated data.</span>

                    <span>The current paper studies the problem of minimizing a loss
$f(\boldsymbol{x})$ subject to constraints of the form
$\boldsymbol{D}\boldsymbol{x} \in S$, where $S$ is a closed set, convex or not,
and $\boldsymbol{D}$ is a matrix that fuses parameters. Fusion constraints can
capture smoothness, sparsity, or more general constraint patterns. To tackle
this generic class of problems, we combine the Beltrami-Courant penalty method
with the proximal distance principle. The latter is driven by minimization of
penalized objectives
$f(\boldsymbol{x})+\frac{\rho}{2}\text{dist}(\boldsymbol{D}\boldsymbol{x},S)^2$
involving large tuning constants $\rho$ and the squared Euclidean distance of
$\boldsymbol{D}\boldsymbol{x}$ from $S$. The next iterate
$\boldsymbol{x}_{n+1}$ of the corresponding proximal distance algorithm is
constructed from the current iterate $\boldsymbol{x}_n$ by minimizing the
majorizing surrogate function
$f(\boldsymbol{x})+\frac{\rho}{2}\|\boldsymbol{D}\boldsymbol{x}-\mathcal{P}_{S}(\boldsymbol{D}\boldsymbol{x}_n)\|^2$.
For fixed $\rho$ and a subanalytic loss $f(\boldsymbol{x})$ and a subanalytic
constraint set $S$, we prove convergence to a stationary point. Under stronger
assumptions, we provide convergence rates and demonstrate linear local
convergence. We also construct a steepest descent (SD) variant to avoid costly
linear system solves. To benchmark our algorithms, we compare against the
alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM). Our extensive numerical
tests include problems on metric projection, convex regression, convex
clustering, total variation image denoising, and projection of a matrix to a
good condition number. These experiments demonstrate the superior speed and
acceptable accuracy of our steepest variant on high-dimensional problems.</span>

                    <span>Alzheimer&#x27;s disease (AD) is an irreversible neurode generative disease of the
brain.The disease may causes memory loss, difficulty communicating and
disorientation. For the diagnosis of Alzheimer&#x27;s disease, a series of scales
are often needed to evaluate the diagnosis clinically, which not only increases
the workload of doctors, but also makes the results of diagnosis highly
subjective. Therefore, for Alzheimer&#x27;s disease, imaging means to find early
diagnostic markers has become a top priority.

In this paper, we propose a novel 3DMgNet architecture which is a unified
framework of multigrid and convolutional neural network to diagnose Alzheimer&#x27;s
disease (AD). The model is trained using an open dataset (ADNI dataset) and
then test with a smaller dataset of ours. Finally, the model achieved 92.133%
accuracy for AD vs NC classification and significantly reduced the model
parameters.</span>

                    <span>Continual Learning (CL) aims to develop agents emulating the human ability to
sequentially learn new tasks while being able to retain knowledge obtained from
past experiences. In this paper, we introduce the novel problem of
Memory-Constrained Online Continual Learning (MC-OCL) which imposes strict
constraints on the memory overhead that a possible algorithm can use to avoid
catastrophic forgetting. As most, if not all, previous CL methods violate these
constraints, we propose an algorithmic solution to MC-OCL: Batch-level
Distillation (BLD), a regularization-based CL approach, which effectively
balances stability and plasticity in order to learn from data streams, while
preserving the ability to solve old tasks through distillation. Our extensive
experimental evaluation, conducted on three publicly available benchmarks,
empirically demonstrates that our approach successfully addresses the MC-OCL
problem and achieves comparable accuracy to prior distillation methods
requiring higher memory overhead.</span>

                    <span>There is a recent proliferation of research on the integration of machine
learning and optimization. One expansive area within this research stream is
predictive-model embedded optimization, which uses pre-trained predictive
models for the objective function of an optimization problem, so that features
of the predictive models become decision variables in the optimization problem.
Despite a recent surge in publications in this area, one aspect of this
decision-making pipeline that has been largely overlooked is training
relevance, i.e., ensuring that solutions to the optimization problem should be
similar to the data used to train the predictive models. In this paper, we
propose constraints designed to enforce training relevance, and show through a
collection of experimental results that adding the suggested constraints
significantly improves the quality of solutions obtained.</span>

                    <span>In this work we propose a HyperTransformer, a transformer-based model for
few-shot learning that generates weights of a convolutional neural network
(CNN) directly from support samples. Since the dependence of a small generated
CNN model on a specific task is encoded by a high-capacity transformer model,
we effectively decouple the complexity of the large task space from the
complexity of individual tasks. Our method is particularly effective for small
target CNN architectures where learning a fixed universal task-independent
embedding is not optimal and better performance is attained when the
information about the task can modulate all model parameters. For larger models
we discover that generating the last layer alone allows us to produce
competitive or better results than those obtained with state-of-the-art methods
while being end-to-end differentiable. Finally, we extend our approach to a
semi-supervised regime utilizing unlabeled samples in the support set and
further improving few-shot performance.</span>

system is a challenging task with useful applications. Existing style transfer
systems require access to a reference content motion clip, however, in
real-time systems the future motion content is unknown and liable to change
with user input. In this work we present a style modelling system that uses an
animation synthesis network to model motion content based on local motion
phases. An additional style modulation network uses feature-wise
transformations to modulate style in real-time. To evaluate our method, we
create and release a new style modelling dataset, 100STYLE, containing over 4
million frames of stylised locomotion data in 100 different styles that present
a number of challenges for existing systems. To model these styles, we extend
the local phase calculation with a contact-free formulation. In comparison to
other methods for real-time style modelling, we show our system is more robust

                    <span>Robust machine learning is an increasingly important topic that focuses on
developing models resilient to various forms of imperfect data. Due to the
pervasiveness of recommender systems in online technologies, researchers have
carried out several robustness studies focusing on data sparsity and profile
injection attacks. Instead, we propose a more holistic view of robustness for
recommender systems that encompasses multiple dimensions - robustness with
respect to sub-populations, transformations, distributional disparity, attack,
and data sparsity. While there are several libraries that allow users to
compare different recommender system models, there is no software library for
comprehensive robustness evaluation of recommender system models under
different scenarios. As our main contribution, we present a robustness
evaluation toolkit, Robustness Gym for RecSys (RGRecSys --

                    <span>The improvement of air-quality in urban areas is one of the main concerns of
public government bodies. This concern emerges from the evidence between the
air quality and the public health. Major efforts from government bodies in this
area include monitoring and forecasting systems, banning more pollutant motor
vehicles, and traffic limitations during the periods of low-quality air. In
this work, a proposal for dynamic prices in regulated parking services is
presented. The dynamic prices in parking service must discourage motor vehicles
parking when low-quality episodes are predicted. For this purpose, diverse deep
learning strategies are evaluated. They have in common the use of collective
air-quality measurements for forecasting labels about air quality in the city.
The proposal is evaluated by using economic parameters and deep learning

                    <span>In 1950, Alan Turing proposed an imitation game as the ultimate test of
whether a machine was intelligent: could a machine imitate a human so well that
its answers to questions indistinguishable from a human. Ever since, creating
intelligence that matches human intelligence has implicitly or explicitly been
the goal of thousands of researchers, engineers, and entrepreneurs. The
benefits of human-like artificial intelligence (HLAI) include soaring
productivity, increased leisure, and perhaps most profoundly, a better
understanding of our own minds.

But not all types of AI are human-like. In fact, many of the most powerful
systems are very different from humans. So an excessive focus on developing and
deploying HLAI can lead us into a trap. As machines become better substitutes
for human labor, workers lose economic and political bargaining power and
become increasingly dependent on those who control the technology. In contrast,
when AI is focused on augmenting humans rather than mimicking them, then humans
retain the power to insist on a share of the value created. Furthermore,
augmentation creates new capabilities and new products and services, ultimately
generating far more value than merely human-like AI. While both types of AI can
be enormously beneficial, there are currently excess incentives for automation
rather than augmentation among technologists, business executives, and
policymakers.</span>

                    <span>Wall-clock convergence time and communication load are key performance
metrics for the distributed implementation of stochastic gradient descent (SGD)
in parameter server settings. Communication-adaptive distributed Adam (CADA)
has been recently proposed as a way to reduce communication load via the
adaptive selection of workers. CADA is subject to performance degradation in
terms of wall-clock convergence time in the presence of stragglers. This paper
proposes a novel scheme named grouping-based CADA (G-CADA) that retains the
advantages of CADA in reducing the communication load, while increasing the
robustness to stragglers at the cost of additional storage at the workers.
G-CADA partitions the workers into groups of workers that are assigned the same
data shards. Groups are scheduled adaptively at each iteration, and the server
only waits for the fastest worker in each selected group. We provide analysis
and experimental results to elaborate the significant gains on the wall-clock
time, as well as communication load and computation load, of G-CADA over other
benchmark schemes.</span>

                    <span>Evolutionary Algorithms (EAs) and Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) have
recently been combined to integrate the advantages of the two solutions for
better policy learning. However, in existing hybrid methods, EA is used to
directly train the policy network, which will lead to sample inefficiency and
unpredictable impact on the policy performance. To better integrate these two
approaches and avoid the drawbacks caused by the introduction of EA, we devote
ourselves to devising a more efficient and reasonable method of combining EA
and DRL. In this paper, we propose Evolutionary Action Selection-Twin Delayed
Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (EAS-TD3), a novel combination of EA and
DRL. In EAS, we focus on optimizing the action chosen by the policy network and
attempt to obtain high-quality actions to guide policy learning through an

continuous control tasks. The result shows that EAS-TD3 shows superior
performance over other state-of-art methods.</span>

                    <span>Appropriately identifying and treating molecules and materials with
significant multi-reference (MR) character is crucial for achieving high data
fidelity in virtual high throughput screening (VHTS). Nevertheless, most VHTS
is carried out with approximate density functional theory (DFT) using a single
functional. Despite development of numerous MR diagnostics, the extent to which
a single value of such a diagnostic indicates MR effect on chemical property
prediction is not well established. We evaluate MR diagnostics of over 10,000
transition metal complexes (TMCs) and compare to those in organic molecules. We
reveal that only some MR diagnostics are transferable across these materials
spaces. By studying the influence of MR character on chemical properties (i.e.,
MR effect) that involves multiple potential energy surfaces (i.e., adiabatic
spin splitting, $\Delta E_\mathrm{H-L}$, and ionization potential, IP), we
observe that cancellation in MR effect outweighs accumulation. Differences in
MR character are more important than the total degree of MR character in
predicting MR effect in property prediction. Motivated by this observation, we
build transfer learning models to directly predict CCSD(T)-level adiabatic
$\Delta E_\mathrm{H-L}$ and IP from lower levels of theory. By combining these
models with uncertainty quantification and multi-level modeling, we introduce a
multi-pronged strategy that accelerates data acquisition by at least a factor
of three while achieving chemical accuracy (i.e., 1 kcal/mol) for robust VHTS.</span>

                    <span>In practice, it is very demanding and sometimes impossible to collect
datasets of tagged data large enough to successfully train a machine learning
model, and one possible solution to this problem is transfer learning. This
study aims to assess how transferable are the features between different
domains of time series data and under which conditions. The effects of transfer
learning are observed in terms of predictive performance of the models and
their convergence rate during training. In our experiment, we use reduced data
sets of 1,500 and 9,000 data instances to mimic real world conditions. Using
the same scaled-down datasets, we trained two sets of machine learning models:
those that were trained with transfer learning and those that were trained from
scratch. Four machine learning models were used for the experiment. Transfer of
knowledge was performed within the same domain of application (seismology), as
well as between mutually different domains of application (seismology, speech,
medicine, finance). We observe the predictive performance of the models and the
convergence rate during the training. In order to confirm the validity of the
obtained results, we repeated the experiments seven times and applied
statistical tests to confirm the significance of the results. The general
conclusion of our study is that transfer learning is very likely to either
increase or not negatively affect the predictive performance of the model or
its convergence rate. The collected data is analysed in more details to
determine which source and target domains are compatible for transfer of
knowledge. We also analyse the effect of target dataset size and the selection
of model and its hyperparameters on the effects of transfer learning.</span>

                    <span>Efficient model selection for identifying a suitable pre-trained neural
network to a downstream task is a fundamental yet challenging task in deep
learning. Current practice requires expensive computational costs in model
training for performance prediction. In this paper, we propose a novel
framework for neural network selection by analyzing the governing dynamics over
synaptic connections (edges) during training. Our framework is built on the
fact that back-propagation during neural network training is equivalent to the
dynamical evolution of synaptic connections. Therefore, a converged neural
network is associated with an equilibrium state of a networked system composed
of those edges. To this end, we construct a network mapping $\phi$, converting
a neural network $G_A$ to a directed line graph $G_B$ that is defined on those
edges in $G_A$. Next, we derive a neural capacitance metric $\beta_{\rm eff}$
as a predictive measure universally capturing the generalization capability of
$G_A$ on the downstream task using only a handful of early training results. We
carried out extensive experiments using 17 popular pre-trained ImageNet models
and five benchmark datasets, including CIFAR10, CIFAR100, SVHN, Fashion MNIST
and Birds, to evaluate the fine-tuning performance of our framework. Our neural
capacitance metric is shown to be a powerful indicator for model selection
based only on early training results and is more efficient than
state-of-the-art methods.</span>

                    <span>This paper focuses on training implicit models of infinite layers.
Specifically, previous works employ implicit differentiation and solve the
exact gradient for the backward propagation. However, is it necessary to
compute such an exact but expensive gradient for training? In this work, we
propose a novel gradient estimate for implicit models, named phantom gradient,
that 1) forgoes the costly computation of the exact gradient; and 2) provides
an update direction empirically preferable to the implicit model training. We
theoretically analyze the condition under which an ascent direction of the loss
landscape could be found, and provide two specific instantiations of the
phantom gradient based on the damped unrolling and Neumann series. Experiments
on large-scale tasks demonstrate that these lightweight phantom gradients
significantly accelerate the backward passes in training implicit models by
roughly 1.7 times, and even boost the performance over approaches based on the
exact gradient on ImageNet.</span>

                    <span>Using personalized explanations to support recommendations has been shown to
increase trust and perceived quality. However, to actually obtain better
recommendations, there needs to be a means for users to modify the
recommendation criteria by interacting with the explanation. We present a novel
technique using aspect markers that learns to generate personalized
explanations of recommendations from review texts, and we show that human users
significantly prefer these explanations over those produced by state-of-the-art
techniques. Our work&#x27;s most important innovation is that it allows users to
react to a recommendation by critiquing the textual explanation: removing
(symmetrically adding) certain aspects they dislike or that are no longer
relevant (symmetrically that are of interest). The system updates its user
model and the resulting recommendations according to the critique. This is
based on a novel unsupervised critiquing method for single- and multi-step
critiquing with textual explanations. Experiments on two real-world datasets
show that our system is the first to achieve good performance in adapting to
the preferences expressed in multi-step critiquing.</span>

                    <span>Recent work on audio-visual navigation targets a single static sound in
noise-free audio environments and struggles to generalize to unheard sounds. We
introduce the novel dynamic audio-visual navigation benchmark in which an
embodied AI agent must catch a moving sound source in an unmapped environment
in the presence of distractors and noisy sounds. We propose an end-to-end
reinforcement learning approach that relies on a multi-modal architecture that
fuses the spatial audio-visual information from a binaural audio signal and
spatial occupancy maps to encode the features needed to learn a robust
navigation policy for our new complex task settings. We demonstrate that our
approach outperforms the current state-of-the-art with better generalization to
unheard sounds and better robustness to noisy scenarios on the two challenging
3D scanned real-world datasets Replica and Matterport3D, for the static and
dynamic audio-visual navigation benchmarks. Our novel benchmark will be made

                    <span>Dozens of terrorist attacks are perpetrated in the United States every year,
often causing fatalities and other significant damage. Toward the end of better
understanding and mitigating these attacks, we present a set of machine
learning models that learn from localized news data in order to predict whether
a terrorist attack will occur on a given calendar date and in a given state.
The best model--a Random Forest that learns from a novel variable-length moving
average representation of the feature space--achieves area under the receiver
operating characteristic scores $&gt; .667$ on four of the five states that were
impacted most by terrorism between 2015 and 2018. Our key findings include that
modeling terrorism as a set of independent events, rather than as a continuous
process, is a fruitful approach--especially when the events are sparse and
dissimilar. Additionally, our results highlight the need for localized models
that account for differences between locations. From a machine learning
perspective, we found that the Random Forest model outperformed several deep
models on our multimodal, noisy, and imbalanced data set, thus demonstrating
the efficacy of our novel feature representation method in such a context. We
also show that its predictions are relatively robust to time gaps between
attacks and observed characteristics of the attacks. Finally, we analyze
factors that limit model performance, which include a noisy feature space and
small amount of available data. These contributions provide an important
foundation for the use of machine learning in efforts against terrorism in the
United States and beyond.</span>

                    <span>Money laundering is a profound, global problem. Nonetheless, there is little
statistical and machine learning research on the topic. In this paper, we focus
on anti-money laundering in banks. To help organize existing research in the
field, we propose a unifying terminology and provide a review of the
literature. This is structured around two central tasks: (i) client risk
profiling and (ii) suspicious behavior flagging. We find that client risk
profiling is characterized by diagnostics, i.e., efforts to find and explain
risk factors. Suspicious behavior flagging, on the other hand, is characterized
by non-disclosed features and hand-crafted risk indices. Finally, we discuss
directions for future research. One major challenge is the lack of public data
sets. This may, potentially, be addressed by synthetic data generation. Other
possible research directions include semi-supervised and deep learning,
interpretability and fairness of the results.</span>

                    <span>Tether-net launched from a chaser spacecraft provides a promising method to
capture and dispose of large space debris in orbit. This tether-net system is
subject to several sources of uncertainty in sensing and actuation that affect
the performance of its net launch and closing control. Earlier
reliability-based optimization approaches to design control actions however
remain challenging and computationally prohibitive to generalize over varying
launch scenarios and target (debris) state relative to the chaser. To search
for a general and reliable control policy, this paper presents a reinforcement
learning framework that integrates a proximal policy optimization (PPO2)
approach with net dynamics simulations. The latter allows evaluating the
episodes of net-based target capture, and estimate the capture quality index
that serves as the reward feedback to PPO2. Here, the learned policy is
designed to model the timing of the net closing action based on the state of
the moving net and the target, under any given launch scenario. A stochastic
state transition model is considered in order to incorporate synthetic
uncertainties in state estimation and launch actuation. Along with notable
reward improvement during training, the trained policy demonstrates capture
performance (over a wide range of launch/target scenarios) that is close to
that obtained with reliability-based optimization run over an individual
scenario.</span>

                    <span>Contrastive learning relies on an assumption that positive pairs contain
related views, e.g., patches of an image or co-occurring multimodal signals of
a video, that share certain underlying information about an instance. But what
if this assumption is violated? The literature suggests that contrastive
learning produces suboptimal representations in the presence of noisy views,
e.g., false positive pairs with no apparent shared information. In this work,
we propose a new contrastive loss function that is robust against noisy views.
We provide rigorous theoretical justifications by showing connections to robust
symmetric losses for noisy binary classification and by establishing a new
contrastive bound for mutual information maximization based on the Wasserstein
distance measure. The proposed loss is completely modality-agnostic and a
simple drop-in replacement for the InfoNCE loss, which makes it easy to apply
to existing contrastive frameworks. We show that our approach provides
consistent improvements over the state-of-the-art on image, video, and graph
contrastive learning benchmarks that exhibit a variety of real-world noise
patterns.</span>

                    <span>Learning disentangled representations of natural language is essential for
many NLP tasks, e.g., conditional text generation, style transfer, personalized
dialogue systems, etc. Similar problems have been studied extensively for other
forms of data, such as images and videos. However, the discrete nature of
natural language makes the disentangling of textual representations more
challenging (e.g., the manipulation over the data space cannot be easily
achieved). Inspired by information theory, we propose a novel method that
effectively manifests disentangled representations of text, without any
supervision on semantics. A new mutual information upper bound is derived and
leveraged to measure dependence between style and content. By minimizing this
upper bound, the proposed method induces style and content embeddings into two
independent low-dimensional spaces. Experiments on both conditional text
generation and text-style transfer demonstrate the high quality of our
disentangled representation in terms of content and style preservation.</span>

                    <span>We consider the fixed-budget best arm identification problem in two-armed
Gaussian bandits with unknown variances. The tightest lower bound on the
complexity and an algorithm whose performance guarantee matches the lower bound
have long been open problems when the variances are unknown and when the
algorithm is agnostic to the optimal proportion of the arm draws. In this
paper, we propose a strategy comprising a sampling rule with randomized
sampling (RS) following the estimated target allocation probabilities of arm
draws and a recommendation rule using the augmented inverse probability
weighting (AIPW) estimator, which is often used in the causal inference
literature. We refer to our strategy as the RS-AIPW strategy. In the
theoretical analysis, we first derive a large deviation principle for
martingales, which can be used when the second moment converges in mean, and
apply it to our proposed strategy. Then, we show that the proposed strategy is
asymptotically optimal in the sense that the probability of misidentification
achieves the lower bound by Kaufmann et al. (2016) when the sample size becomes
infinitely large and the gap between the two arms goes to zero.</span>

                    <span>The Elo rating system is widely adopted to evaluate the skills of (chess)
game and sports players. Recently it has been also integrated into machine
learning algorithms in evaluating the performance of computerised AI agents.
However, an accurate estimation of the Elo rating (for the top players) often
requires many rounds of competitions, which can be expensive to carry out. In
this paper, to improve the sample efficiency of the Elo evaluation (for top
players), we propose an efficient online match scheduling algorithm.
Specifically, we identify and match the top players through a dueling bandits
framework and tailor the bandit algorithm to the gradient-based update of Elo.
We show that it reduces the per-step memory and time complexity to constant,
compared to the traditional likelihood maximization approaches requiring $O(t)$
time. Our algorithm has a regret guarantee of $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{T})$, sublinear
in the number of competition rounds and has been extended to the
multidimensional Elo ratings for handling intransitive games. We empirically
demonstrate that our method achieves superior convergence speed and time
efficiency on a variety of gaming tasks.</span>

                    <span>Real-world machine learning deployments are characterized by mismatches
between the source (training) and target (test) distributions that may cause
performance drops. In this work, we investigate methods for predicting the
target domain accuracy using only labeled source data and unlabeled target
data. We propose Average Thresholded Confidence (ATC), a practical method that
learns a threshold on the model&#x27;s confidence, predicting accuracy as the
fraction of unlabeled examples for which model confidence exceeds that
threshold. ATC outperforms previous methods across several model architectures,
types of distribution shifts (e.g., due to synthetic corruptions, dataset
reproduction, or novel subpopulations), and datasets (Wilds, ImageNet, Breeds,
CIFAR, and MNIST). In our experiments, ATC estimates target performance
$2$-$4\times$ more accurately than prior methods. We also explore the
theoretical foundations of the problem, proving that, in general, identifying
the accuracy is just as hard as identifying the optimal predictor and thus, the
efficacy of any method rests upon (perhaps unstated) assumptions on the nature
of the shift. Finally, analyzing our method on some toy distributions, we
provide insights concerning when it works.</span>

                    <span>Understanding the structure of loss landscape of deep neural networks
(DNNs)is obviously important. In this work, we prove an embedding principle
that the loss landscape of a DNN &quot;contains&quot; all the critical points of all the
narrower DNNs. More precisely, we propose a critical embedding such that any
critical point, e.g., local or global minima, of a narrower DNN can be embedded
to a critical point/hyperplane of the target DNN with higher degeneracy and
preserving the DNN output function. The embedding structure of critical points
is independent of loss function and training data, showing a stark difference
from other nonconvex problems such as protein-folding. Empirically, we find
that a wide DNN is often attracted by highly-degenerate critical points that
are embedded from narrow DNNs. The embedding principle provides an explanation
for the general easy optimization of wide DNNs and unravels a potential
implicit low-complexity regularization during the training. Overall, our work
provides a skeleton for the study of loss landscape of DNNs and its
implication, by which a more exact and comprehensive understanding can be

                    <span>Glioblastoma Multiforme (GBM) is a malignant brain cancer forming around 48%
of al brain and Central Nervous System (CNS) cancers. It is estimated that
annually over 13,000 deaths occur in the US due to GBM, making it crucial to
have early diagnosis systems that can lead to predictable and effective
treatment. The most common treatment after GBM diagnosis is chemotherapy, which
works by sending rapidly dividing cells to apoptosis. However, this form of
treatment is not effective when the MGMT promoter sequence is methylated, and
instead leads to severe side effects decreasing patient survivability.
Therefore, it is important to be able to identify the MGMT promoter methylation
status through non-invasive magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) based machine
learning (ML) models. This is accomplished using the Brain Tumor Segmentation
(BraTS) 2021 dataset, which was recently used for an international Kaggle
competition. We developed four primary models - two radiomic models and two CNN
models - each solving the binary classification task with progressive
improvements. We built a novel ML model termed as the Intermediate State
Generator which was used to normalize the slice thicknesses of all MRI scans.
With further improvements, our best model was able to achieve performance
significantly ($p &lt; 0.05$) better than the best performing Kaggle model with a
6% increase in average cross-validation accuracy. This improvement could
potentially lead to a more informed choice of chemotherapy as a treatment
option, prolonging lives of thousands of patients with GBM each year.</span>

                    <span>Multi-view subspace clustering has conventionally focused on integrating
heterogeneous feature descriptions to capture higher-dimensional information.
One popular strategy is to generate a common subspace from different views and
then apply graph-based approaches to deal with clustering. However, the
performance of these methods is still subject to two limitations, namely the
multiple views fusion pattern and the connection between the fusion process and
clustering tasks. To address these problems, we propose a novel multi-view
subspace clustering framework via fine-grained graph learning, which can tell
the consistency of local structures between different views and integrate all
views more delicately than previous weight regularizations. Different from
other models in the literature, the point-level graph regularization and the
reformulation of spectral clustering are introduced to perform graphs fusion
and learn the shared cluster structure together. Extensive experiments on five
real-world datasets show that the proposed framework has comparable performance
to the SOTA algorithms.</span>

                    <span>In this work we present a preliminary investigation of a novel algorithm
called Dyna-T. In reinforcement learning (RL) a planning agent has its own
representation of the environment as a model. To discover an optimal policy to
interact with the environment, the agent collects experience in a trial and
error fashion. Experience can be used for learning a better model or improve
directly the value function and policy. Typically separated, Dyna-Q is an
hybrid approach which, at each iteration, exploits the real experience to
update the model as well as the value function, while planning its action using
simulated data from its model. However, the planning process is computationally
expensive and strongly depends on the dimensionality of the state-action space.
We propose to build a Upper Confidence Tree (UCT) on the simulated experience
and search for the best action to be selected during the on-line learning
process. We prove the effectiveness of our proposed method on a set of
preliminary tests on three testbed environments from Open AI. In contrast to
Dyna-Q, Dyna-T outperforms state-of-the-art RL agents in the stochastic
environments by choosing a more robust action selection strategy.</span>

                    <span>Self-supervised representation learning (SSL) on biomedical networks provides
new opportunities for drug discovery which is lack of available biological or
clinic phenotype. However, how to effectively combine multiple SSL models is
challenging and rarely explored. Therefore, we propose multi-task joint
strategies of self-supervised representation learning on biomedical networks
for drug discovery, named MSSL2drug. We design six basic SSL tasks that are
inspired by various modality features including structures, semantics, and
attributes in biomedical heterogeneous networks. In addition, fifteen
combinations of multiple tasks are evaluated by a graph attention-based
adversarial multi-task learning framework in two drug discovery scenarios. The
results suggest two important findings. (1) The combinations of multimodal
tasks achieve the best performance compared to other multi-task joint
strategies. (2) The joint training of local and global SSL tasks yields higher
performance than random task combinations. Therefore, we conjecture that the
multimodal and local-global combination strategies can be regarded as a
guideline for multi-task SSL to drug discovery.</span>

                    <span>Video understanding requires reasoning at multiple spatiotemporal resolutions
-- from short fine-grained motions to events taking place over longer
durations. Although transformer architectures have recently advanced the
state-of-the-art, they have not explicitly modelled different spatiotemporal
resolutions. To this end, we present Multiview Transformers for Video
Recognition (MTV). Our model consists of separate encoders to represent
different views of the input video with lateral connections to fuse information
across views. We present thorough ablation studies of our model and show that
MTV consistently performs better than single-view counterparts in terms of
accuracy and computational cost across a range of model sizes. Furthermore, we
achieve state-of-the-art results on five standard datasets, and improve even
further with large-scale pretraining. We will release code and pretrained
checkpoints.</span>

                    <span>Mixup is a data-dependent regularization technique that consists in linearly
interpolating input samples and associated outputs. It has been shown to
improve accuracy when used to train on standard machine learning datasets.
However, authors have pointed out that Mixup can produce out-of-distribution
virtual samples and even contradictions in the augmented training set,
potentially resulting in adversarial effects. In this paper, we introduce Local
Mixup in which distant input samples are weighted down when computing the loss.
In constrained settings we demonstrate that Local Mixup can create a trade-off
between bias and variance, with the extreme cases reducing to vanilla training
and classical Mixup. Using standardized computer vision benchmarks , we also
show that Local Mixup can improve test accuracy.</span>

                    <span>This work systematically investigates the adversarial robustness of deep
image denoisers (DIDs), i.e, how well DIDs can recover the ground truth from
noisy observations degraded by adversarial perturbations. Firstly, to evaluate
DIDs&#x27; robustness, we propose a novel adversarial attack, namely
Observation-based Zero-mean Attack ({\sc ObsAtk}), to craft adversarial
zero-mean perturbations on given noisy images. We find that existing DIDs are
vulnerable to the adversarial noise generated by {\sc ObsAtk}. Secondly, to
robustify DIDs, we propose an adversarial training strategy, hybrid adversarial
training ({\sc HAT}), that jointly trains DIDs with adversarial and
non-adversarial noisy data to ensure that the reconstruction quality is high
and the denoisers around non-adversarial data are locally smooth. The resultant
DIDs can effectively remove various types of synthetic and adversarial noise.
We also uncover that the robustness of DIDs benefits their generalization
capability on unseen real-world noise. Indeed, {\sc HAT}-trained DIDs can
recover high-quality clean images from real-world noise even without training
on real noisy data. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets, including
Set68, PolyU, and SIDD, corroborate the effectiveness of {\sc ObsAtk} and {\sc
HAT}.</span>

                    <span>Given $n$ i.i.d. samples drawn from an unknown distribution $P$, when is it
possible to produce a larger set of $n+m$ samples which cannot be distinguished
from $n+m$ i.i.d. samples drawn from $P$? (Axelrod et al. 2019) formalized this
question as the sample amplification problem, and gave optimal amplification
procedures for discrete distributions and Gaussian location models. However,
these procedures and associated lower bounds are tailored to the specific
distribution classes, and a general statistical understanding of sample
amplification is still largely missing. In this work, we place the sample
amplification problem on a firm statistical foundation by deriving generally
applicable amplification procedures, lower bound techniques and connections to
existing statistical notions. Our techniques apply to a large class of
distributions including the exponential family, and establish a rigorous
connection between sample amplification and distribution learning.</span>

                    <span>Automatic segmentation of lung lesions associated with COVID-19 in CT images
requires large amount of annotated volumes. Annotations mandate expert
knowledge and are time-intensive to obtain through fully manual segmentation
methods. Additionally, lung lesions have large inter-patient variations, with
some pathologies having similar visual appearance as healthy lung tissues. This
poses a challenge when applying existing semi-automatic interactive
segmentation techniques for data labelling. To address these challenges, we
propose an efficient convolutional neural networks (CNNs) that can be learned
online while the annotator provides scribble-based interaction. To accelerate
learning from only the samples labelled through user-interactions, a
patch-based approach is used for training the network. Moreover, we use
weighted cross-entropy loss to address the class imbalance that may result from
user-interactions. During online inference, the learned network is applied to
the whole input volume using a fully convolutional approach. We compare our
proposed method with state-of-the-art and show that it outperforms existing
methods on the task of annotating lung lesions associated with COVID-19,
achieving 16% higher Dice score while reducing execution time by 3$\times$ and
requiring 9000 lesser scribbles-based labelled voxels. Due to the online
learning aspect, our approach adapts quickly to user input, resulting in high
quality segmentation labels. Source code will be made available upon
acceptance.</span>

                    <span>Mobile devices increasingly rely on object detection (OD) through deep neural
networks (DNNs) to perform critical tasks. Due to their high complexity, the
execution of these DNNs requires excessive time and energy. Low-complexity
object tracking (OT) can be used with OD, where the latter is periodically
applied to generate &quot;fresh&quot; references for tracking. However, the frames
processed with OD incur large delays, which may make the reference outdated and
degrade tracking quality. Herein, we propose to use edge computing in this
context, and establish parallel OT (at the mobile device) and OD (at the edge
server) processes that are resilient to large OD latency. We propose Katch-Up,
a novel tracking mechanism that improves the system resilience to excessive OD
delay. However, while Katch-Up significantly improves performance, it also
increases the computing load of the mobile device. Hence, we design SmartDet, a
low-complexity controller based on deep reinforcement learning (DRL) that
learns controlling the trade-off between resource utilization and OD
performance. SmartDet takes as input context-related information related to the
current video content and the current network conditions to optimize frequency
and type of OD offloading, as well as Katch-Up utilization. We extensively
evaluate SmartDet on a real-world testbed composed of a JetSon Nano as mobile
device and a GTX 980 Ti as edge server, connected through a Wi-Fi link.
Experimental results show that SmartDet achieves an optimal balance between
tracking performance - mean Average Recall (mAR) and resource usage. With
respect to a baseline with full Katch-Upusage and maximum channel usage, we
still increase mAR by 4% while using 50% less of the channel and 30% power
resources associated with Katch-Up. With respect to a fixed strategy using
minimal resources, we increase mAR by 20% while using Katch-Up on 1/3 of the
frames.</span>

arbitrary infinite binary information systems each of which consists of an
infinite set of elements and an infinite set of two-valued functions
(attributes) defined on the set of elements. We consider the notion of a
problem over information system, which is described by a finite number of
attributes: for a given element, we should recognize values of these
attributes. As algorithms for problem solving, we consider decision trees of
two types: (i) using only proper hypotheses (an analog of proper equivalence
queries from exact learning), and (ii) using both attributes and proper
hypotheses. As time complexity, we study the depth of decision trees. In the
worst case, with the growth of the number of attributes in the problem
description, the minimum depth of decision trees of both types either is
bounded from above by a constant or grows as a logarithm, or linearly. Based on
these results and results obtained earlier for attributes and arbitrary
hypotheses, we divide the set of all infinite binary information systems into
seven complexity classes.</span>

                    <span>As a hybrid imaging technology, photoacoustic microscopy (PAM) imaging
suffers from noise due to the maximum permissible exposure of laser intensity,
attenuation of ultrasound in the tissue, and the inherent noise of the
transducer. De-noising is a post-processing method to reduce noise, and PAM
image quality can be recovered. However, previous de-noising techniques usually
heavily rely on mathematical priors as well as manually selected parameters,
resulting in unsatisfactory and slow de-noising performance for different noisy
images, which greatly hinders practical and clinical applications. In this
work, we propose a deep learning-based method to remove complex noise from PAM
images without mathematical priors and manual selection of settings for
different input images. An attention enhanced generative adversarial network is
used to extract image features and remove various noises. The proposed method
is demonstrated on both synthetic and real datasets, including phantom (leaf
veins) and in vivo (mouse ear blood vessels and zebrafish pigment) experiments.
The results show that compared with previous PAM de-noising methods, our method
exhibits good performance in recovering images qualitatively and
quantitatively. In addition, the de-noising speed of 0.016 s is achieved for an
image with $256\times256$ pixels. Our approach is effective and practical for
the de-noising of PAM images.</span>

for granular computing. The basis of granular-ball computing is the
granular-ball generation method. This paper proposes a method for accelerating
the granular-ball generation using the division to replace $k$-means. It can
greatly improve the efficiency of granular-ball generation while ensuring the
accuracy similar to the existing method. Besides, a new adaptive method for the

that learns and controls overlapping style attributes avoiding interference.
UniTTS represents multiple style attributes in a single unified embedding space
by the residuals between the phoneme embeddings before and after applying the
attributes. The proposed method is especially effective in controlling multiple
attributes that are difficult to separate cleanly, such as speaker ID and
emotion, because it minimizes redundancy when adding variance in speaker ID and
emotion, and additionally, predicts duration, pitch, and energy based on the
speaker ID and emotion. In experiments, the visualization results exhibit that
the proposed methods learned multiple attributes harmoniously in a manner that
can be easily separated again. As well, UniTTS synthesized high-fidelity speech
signals controlling multiple style attributes. The synthesized speech samples

spatial constraints and relationships between different objects. We aim to
discover these rules from demonstrations by posing manipulation as a
classification problem over a graph, whose nodes represent task-relevant
entities like objects and goals, and present a graph neural network (GNN)
policy architecture for solving this problem from demonstrations. In our
experiments, a single GNN policy trained using imitation learning (IL) on 20
expert demos can solve blockstacking, rearrangement, and dishwasher loading
tasks; once the policy has learned the spatial structure, it can generalize to
a larger number of objects, goal configurations, and from simulation to the
real world. These experiments show that graphical IL can solve complex
long-horizon manipulation problems without requiring detailed task
descriptions. Videos can be found at: https://youtu.be/POxaTDAj7aY.</span>

                    <span>Quantum machine learning (QML) offers a powerful, flexible paradigm for
programming near-term quantum computers, with applications in chemistry,
metrology, materials science, data science, and mathematics. Here, one trains
an ansatz, in the form of a parameterized quantum circuit, to accomplish a task
of interest. However, challenges have recently emerged suggesting that deep
ansatzes are difficult to train, due to flat training landscapes caused by
randomness or by hardware noise. This motivates our work, where we present a
variable structure approach to build ansatzes for QML. Our approach, called
VAns (Variable Ansatz), applies a set of rules to both grow and (crucially)
remove quantum gates in an informed manner during the optimization.
Consequently, VAns is ideally suited to mitigate trainability and noise-related
issues by keeping the ansatz shallow. We employ VAns in the variational quantum
eigensolver for condensed matter and quantum chemistry applications and also in
the quantum autoencoder for data compression, showing successful results in all
cases.</span>

                    <span>We present a reward-predictive, model-based deep learning method featuring
trajectory-constrained visual attention for use in mapless, local visual
navigation tasks. Our method learns to place visual attention at locations in
latent image space which follow trajectories caused by vehicle control actions
to enhance predictive accuracy during planning. The attention model is jointly
optimized by the task-specific loss and an additional trajectory-constraint
loss, allowing adaptability yet encouraging a regularized structure for
improved generalization and reliability. Importantly, visual attention is
applied in latent feature map space instead of raw image space to promote
efficient planning. We validated our model in visual navigation tasks of
planning low turbulence, collision-free trajectories in off-road settings and
hill climbing with locking differentials in the presence of slippery terrain.
Experiments involved randomized procedural generated simulation and real-world
environments. We found our method improved generalization and learning
efficiency when compared to no-attention and self-attention alternatives.</span>

                    <span>The study of provable adversarial robustness has mostly been limited to
classification tasks and models with one-dimensional real-valued outputs. We
extend the scope of certifiable robustness to problems with more general and
structured outputs like sets, images, language, etc. We model the output space
as a metric space under a distance/similarity function, such as
intersection-over-union, perceptual similarity, total variation distance, etc.
Such models are used in many machine learning problems like image segmentation,
object detection, generative models, image/audio-to-text systems, etc. Based on
a robustness technique called randomized smoothing, our $\textit{center
smoothing}$ procedure can produce models with the guarantee that the change in
the output, as measured by the distance metric, remains small for any
norm-bounded adversarial perturbation of the input. We apply our method to
create certifiably robust models with disparate output spaces - from sets to
images - and show that it yields meaningful certificates without significantly
degrading the performance of the base model. Code for our experiments is
available at: https://github.com/aounon/center-smoothing.</span>

in recent computer vision community. In this work, we construct a structural

to the causal analysis, we propose a novel Domain Invariant Representation
Learning for generalizable person Re-Identification (DIR-ReID) framework.
Specifically, we first propose to disentangle the identity-specific and
domain-specific feature spaces, based on which we propose an effective

Carlo simulations, a version of the traditional Metropolis algorithm which
employs neural networks to provide independent proposals. We illustrate our
ideas using the two-dimensional Ising model. We propose several estimates of
autocorrelation times, some inspired by analytical results derived for the
Metropolized Independent Sampler, which we compare and study as a function of
inverse temperature $\beta$. Based on that we propose an alternative loss
function and study its impact on the autocorelation times. Furthermore, we
investigate the impact of imposing system symmetries ($Z_2$ and/or

times. Eventually, we propose a scheme which incorporates partial heat-bath

                    <span>Out-of-domain (OOD) generalization is a significant challenge for machine
learning models. Many techniques have been proposed to overcome this challenge,
often focused on learning models with certain invariance properties. In this
work, we draw a link between OOD performance and model calibration, arguing
that calibration across multiple domains can be viewed as a special case of an
invariant representation leading to better OOD generalization. Specifically, we
show that under certain conditions, models which achieve \emph{multi-domain
calibration} are provably free of spurious correlations. This leads us to
propose multi-domain calibration as a measurable and trainable surrogate for
the OOD performance of a classifier. We therefore introduce methods that are
easy to apply and allow practitioners to improve multi-domain calibration by
training or modifying an existing model, leading to better performance on
unseen domains. Using four datasets from the recently proposed WILDS OOD
benchmark, as well as the Colored MNIST dataset, we demonstrate that training
or tuning models so they are calibrated across multiple domains leads to
significantly improved performance on unseen test domains. We believe this
intriguing connection between calibration and OOD generalization is promising
from both a practical and theoretical point of view.</span>

applying neural network models in real-world environments. In particular, three
areas have received considerable attention: adversarial robustness, parameter
sparsity, and output stability. Despite numerous attempts on solving these
problems independently, there is very little work addressing the challenges
simultaneously. In this paper, we address this problem of constructing holistic
deep learning models by proposing a novel formulation that solves these issues
in combination. Real-world experiments on both tabular and MNIST dataset show
that our formulation is able to simultaneously improve the accuracy,
robustness, stability, and sparsity over traditional deep learning models among

                    <span>In spite of the new opportunities brought about by the Open RAN, advances in
ML-based network automation have been slow, mainly because of the
unavailability of large-scale datasets and experimental testing infrastructure.
This slows down the development and widespread adoption of Deep Reinforcement
Learning (DRL) agents on real networks, delaying progress in intelligent and
autonomous RAN control. In this paper, we address these challenges by proposing
practical solutions and software pipelines for the design, training, testing,
and experimental evaluation of DRL-based closed-loop control in the Open RAN.
We introduce ColO-RAN, the first publicly-available large-scale O-RAN testing
framework with software-defined radios-in-the-loop. Building on the scale and
computational capabilities of the Colosseum wireless network emulator, ColO-RAN
enables ML research at scale using O-RAN components, programmable base
stations, and a &quot;wireless data factory&quot;. Specifically, we design and develop
three exemplary xApps for DRL-based control of RAN slicing, scheduling and
online model training, and evaluate their performance on a cellular network
with 7 softwarized base stations and 42 users. Finally, we showcase the
portability of ColO-RAN to different platforms by deploying it on Arena, an
indoor programmable testbed. Extensive results from our first-of-its-kind
large-scale evaluation highlight the benefits and challenges of DRL-based
adaptive control. They also provide insights on the development of wireless DRL
pipelines, from data analysis to the design of DRL agents, and on the tradeoffs
associated to training on a live RAN. ColO-RAN and the collected large-scale
dataset will be made publicly available to the research community.</span>

                    <span>Knowledge-dependent tasks typically use two sources of knowledge: parametric,
learned at training time, and contextual, given as a passage at inference time.
To understand how models use these sources together, we formalize the problem
of knowledge conflicts, where the contextual information contradicts the
learned information. Analyzing the behaviour of popular models, we measure
their over-reliance on memorized information (the cause of hallucinations), and
uncover important factors that exacerbate this behaviour. Lastly, we propose a
simple method to mitigate over-reliance on parametric knowledge, which
minimizes hallucination, and improves out-of-distribution generalization by
4%-7%. Our findings demonstrate the importance for practitioners to evaluate
model tendency to hallucinate rather than read, and show that our mitigation
strategy encourages generalization to evolving information (i.e.,
time-dependent queries). To encourage these practices, we have released our
framework for generating knowledge conflicts.</span>

                    <span>We present an automated approach to detect and longitudinally track skin
lesions on 3D total-body skin surface scans. The acquired 3D mesh of the
subject is unwrapped to a 2D texture image, where a trained objected detection
model, Faster R-CNN, localizes the lesions within the 2D domain. These detected
skin lesions are mapped back to the 3D surface of the subject and, for subjects
imaged multiple times, we construct a graph-based matching procedure to
longitudinally track lesions that considers the anatomical correspondences
among pairs of meshes and the geodesic proximity of corresponding lesions and
the inter-lesion geodesic distances.

We evaluated the proposed approach using 3DBodyTex, a publicly available
dataset composed of 3D scans imaging the coloured skin (textured meshes) of 200
human subjects. We manually annotated locations that appeared to the human eye
to contain a pigmented skin lesion as well as tracked a subset of lesions
occurring on the same subject imaged in different poses. Our results, when
compared to three human annotators, suggest that the trained Faster R-CNN
detects lesions at a similar performance level as the human annotators. Our
lesion tracking algorithm achieves an average matching accuracy of 88% on a set
of detected corresponding pairs of prominent lesions of subjects imaged in
different poses, and an average longitudinal accuracy of 71% when encompassing
additional errors due to lesion detection. As there currently is no other
large-scale publicly available dataset of 3D total-body skin lesions, we
publicly release over 25,000 3DBodyTex manual annotations, which we hope will
further research on total-body skin lesion analysis.</span>

                    <span>Offline reinforcement learning (RL) tasks require the agent to learn from a
pre-collected dataset with no further interactions with the environment.
Despite the potential to surpass the behavioral policies, RL-based methods are
generally impractical due to the training instability and bootstrapping the
extrapolation errors, which always require careful hyperparameter tuning via
online evaluation. In contrast, offline imitation learning (IL) has no such
issues since it learns the policy directly without estimating the value
function by bootstrapping. However, IL is usually limited in the capability of
the behavioral policy and tends to learn a mediocre behavior from the dataset
collected by the mixture of policies. In this paper, we aim to take advantage
of IL but mitigate such a drawback. Observing that behavior cloning is able to
imitate neighboring policies with less data, we propose \textit{Curriculum
Offline Imitation Learning (COIL)}, which utilizes an experience picking
strategy for imitating from adaptive neighboring policies with a higher return,
and improves the current policy along curriculum stages. On continuous control
benchmarks, we compare COIL against both imitation-based and RL-based methods,
showing that it not only avoids just learning a mediocre behavior on mixed
datasets but is also even competitive with state-of-the-art offline RL methods.</span>

                    <span>Self-organized criticality describes a class of dynamical systems that
maintain themselves in an attractor state with no intrinsic length or time
scale. Fundamentally, this theoretical construct requires a mechanism for
instability that may trigger additional instabilities locally via dissipative
processes. This concept has been invoked to explain nonlinear dynamical
phenomena such as featureless energy spectra that have been observed
empirically for earthquakes, avalanches, and solar flares. If this
interpretation proves correct, it implies that the solar coronal magnetic field
maintains itself in a critical state via a delicate balance between the
dynamo-driven injection of magnetic energy and the release of that energy via
flaring events. All-sky high-cadence surveys like the Transiting Exoplanet
Survey Satellite (TESS) provide the necessary data to compare the energy
distribution of flaring events in stars of different spectral types to that
observed in the Sun. We identified $\sim 10^6$ flaring events on $\sim 10^5$
stars observed by TESS at 2-minute cadence. By fitting the flare frequency
distribution for different mass bins, we find that all main sequence stars
exhibit distributions of flaring events similar to that observed in the Sun,
independent of their mass or age. This may suggest that stars universally
maintain a critical state in their coronal topologies via magnetic reconnection
events. If this interpretation proves correct, we may be able to infer
properties of magnetic fields, interior structure, and dynamo mechanisms for
stars that are otherwise unresolved point sources.</span>

                    <span>Adversarial attacks can generate adversarial inputs by applying small but
intentionally worst-case perturbations to samples from the dataset, which leads
to even state-of-the-art deep neural networks outputting incorrect answers with
high confidence. Hence, some adversarial defense techniques are developed to
improve the security and robustness of the models and avoid them being
attacked. Gradually, a game-like competition between attackers and defenders
formed, in which both players would attempt to play their best strategies
against each other while maximizing their own payoffs. To solve the game, each
player would choose an optimal strategy against the opponent based on the
prediction of the opponent&#x27;s strategy choice. In this work, we are on the
defensive side to apply game-theoretic approaches on defending against attacks.
We use two randomization methods, random initialization and stochastic
activation pruning, to create diversity of networks. Furthermore, we use one
denoising technique, super resolution, to improve models&#x27; robustness by
preprocessing images before attacks. Our experimental results indicate that
those three methods can effectively improve the robustness of deep-learning
neural networks.</span>

                    <span>Evaluating the worst-case performance of a reinforcement learning (RL) agent
under the strongest/optimal adversarial perturbations on state observations
(within some constraints) is crucial for understanding the robustness of RL
agents. However, finding the optimal adversary is challenging, in terms of both
whether we can find the optimal attack and how efficiently we can find it.
Existing works on adversarial RL either use heuristics-based methods that may
not find the strongest adversary, or directly train an RL-based adversary by
treating the agent as a part of the environment, which can find the optimal
adversary but may become intractable in a large state space. This paper
introduces a novel attacking method to find the optimal attacks through
collaboration between a designed function named &quot;actor&quot; and an RL-based learner
named &quot;director&quot;. The actor crafts state perturbations for a given policy
perturbation direction, and the director learns to propose the best policy
perturbation directions. Our proposed algorithm, PA-AD, is theoretically
optimal and significantly more efficient than prior RL-based works in
environments with large state spaces. Empirical results show that our proposed
PA-AD universally outperforms state-of-the-art attacking methods in various
Atari and MuJoCo environments. By applying PA-AD to adversarial training, we
achieve state-of-the-art empirical robustness in multiple tasks under strong
adversaries.</span>

                    <span>Finding low dimensional representation of data from long-timescale
trajectories of biomolecular processes such as protein-folding or
ligand-receptor binding is of fundamental importance and kinetic models such as
Markov modeling have proven useful in describing the kinetics of these systems.
Recently, an unsupervised machine learning technique called VAMPNet was
introduced to learn the low dimensional representation and linear dynamical
model in an end-to-end manner. VAMPNet is based on variational approach to
Markov processes (VAMP) and relies on neural networks to learn the
coarse-grained dynamics. In this contribution, we combine VAMPNet and graph
neural networks to generate an end-to-end framework to efficiently learn
high-level dynamics and metastable states from the long-timescale molecular
dynamics trajectories. This method bears the advantages of graph representation
learning and uses graph message passing operations to generate an embedding for
each datapoint which is used in the VAMPNet to generate a coarse-grained
representation. This type of molecular representation results in a higher
resolution and more interpretable Markov model than the standard VAMPNet
enabling a more detailed kinetic study of the biomolecular processes. Our
GraphVAMPNet approach is also enhanced with an attention mechanism to find the
important residues for classification into different metastable states.</span>

                    <span>This paper considers multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) tasks where
agents receive a shared global reward at the end of an episode. The delayed
nature of this reward affects the ability of the agents to assess the quality
of their actions at intermediate time-steps. This paper focuses on developing
methods to learn a temporal redistribution of the episodic reward to obtain a
dense reward signal. Solving such MARL problems requires addressing two
challenges: identifying (1) relative importance of states along the length of
an episode (along time), and (2) relative importance of individual agents&#x27;
states at any single time-step (among agents). In this paper, we introduce
Agent-Temporal Attention for Reward Redistribution in Episodic Multi-Agent
Reinforcement Learning (AREL) to address these two challenges. AREL uses
attention mechanisms to characterize the influence of actions on state
transitions along trajectories (temporal attention), and how each agent is
affected by other agents at each time-step (agent attention). The redistributed
rewards predicted by AREL are dense, and can be integrated with any given MARL
algorithm. We evaluate AREL on challenging tasks from the Particle World
environment and the StarCraft Multi-Agent Challenge. AREL results in higher
rewards in Particle World, and improved win rates in StarCraft compared to
three state-of-the-art reward redistribution methods. Our code is available at

                    <span>Many modern applications of online changepoint detection require the ability
to process high-frequency observations, sometimes with limited available
computational resources. Online algorithms for detecting a change in mean often
involve using a moving window, or specifying the expected size of change. Such
choices affect which changes the algorithms have most power to detect. We
introduce an algorithm, Functional Online CuSUM (FOCuS), which is equivalent to
running these earlier methods simultaneously for all sizes of window, or all
possible values for the size of change. Our theoretical results give tight
bounds on the expected computational cost per iteration of FOCuS, with this
being logarithmic in the number of observations. We show how FOCuS can be
applied to a number of different change in mean scenarios, and demonstrate its
practical utility through its state-of-the art performance at detecting
anomalous behaviour in computer server data.</span>

                    <span>Understanding the structure of loss landscape of deep neural networks
(DNNs)is obviously important. In this work, we prove an embedding principle
that the loss landscape of a DNN &quot;contains&quot; all the critical points of all the
narrower DNNs. More precisely, we propose a critical embedding such that any
critical point, e.g., local or global minima, of a narrower DNN can be embedded
to a critical point/hyperplane of the target DNN with higher degeneracy and
preserving the DNN output function. The embedding structure of critical points
is independent of loss function and training data, showing a stark difference
from other nonconvex problems such as protein-folding. Empirically, we find
that a wide DNN is often attracted by highly-degenerate critical points that
are embedded from narrow DNNs. The embedding principle provides an explanation
for the general easy optimization of wide DNNs and unravels a potential
implicit low-complexity regularization during the training. Overall, our work
provides a skeleton for the study of loss landscape of DNNs and its
implication, by which a more exact and comprehensive understanding can be
anticipated in the near</span>

                    <span>Relying on random matrix theory (RMT), this paper studies asymmetric
order-$d$ spiked tensor models with Gaussian noise. Using the variational
definition of the singular vectors and values of (Lim, 2005), we show that the
analysis of the considered model boils down to the analysis of an equivalent
spiked symmetric block-wise random matrix, that is constructed from
contractions of the studied tensor with the singular vectors associated to its
best rank-1 approximation. Our approach allows the exact characterization of
the almost sure asymptotic singular value and alignments of the corresponding
singular vectors with the true spike components, when $\frac{n_i}{\sum_{j&#x3D;1}^d
n_j}\to c_i\in [0, 1]$ with $n_i$&#x27;s the tensor dimensions. In contrast to other
works that rely mostly on tools from statistical physics to study random
tensors, our results rely solely on classical RMT tools such as Stein&#x27;s lemma.
Finally, classical RMT results concerning spiked random matrices are recovered
as a particular case.</span>

                    <span>Statistical tests for dataset shift are susceptible to false alarms: they are
sensitive to minor differences when there is in fact adequate sample coverage
and predictive performance. We propose instead a framework to detect adverse
dataset shifts based on outlier scores, $\texttt{D-SOS}$ for short.
$\texttt{D-SOS}$ holds that the new (test) sample is not substantively worse
than the reference (training) sample, and not that the two are equal. The key
idea is to reduce observations to outlier scores and compare contamination
rates at varying weighted thresholds. Users can define what $\it{worse}$ means
in terms of relevant notions of outlyingness, including proxies for predictive
performance. Compared to tests of equal distribution, our approach is uniquely
tailored to serve as a robust metric for model monitoring and data validation.
We show how versatile and practical $\texttt{D-SOS}$ is on a wide range of real
and simulated data.</span>

introduces the method and shows that it has consistency results that are
similar in nature to those applying to geostatistical modelling and to Quantile
Random Forests. The method allows for embedding of simpler interpolation
techniques, such as Kriging, to further condition the model. The algorithm
works by estimating a conditional distribution for the target variable at each
target location. The family of such distributions is called the envelope of the
target variable. From this, it is possible to obtain spatial estimates,
quantiles and uncertainty. An algorithm to produce conditional simulations from

                    <span>Quantum machine learning (QML) offers a powerful, flexible paradigm for
programming near-term quantum computers, with applications in chemistry,
metrology, materials science, data science, and mathematics. Here, one trains
an ansatz, in the form of a parameterized quantum circuit, to accomplish a task
of interest. However, challenges have recently emerged suggesting that deep
ansatzes are difficult to train, due to flat training landscapes caused by
randomness or by hardware noise. This motivates our work, where we present a
variable structure approach to build ansatzes for QML. Our approach, called
VAns (Variable Ansatz), applies a set of rules to both grow and (crucially)
remove quantum gates in an informed manner during the optimization.
Consequently, VAns is ideally suited to mitigate trainability and noise-related
issues by keeping the ansatz shallow. We employ VAns in the variational quantum
eigensolver for condensed matter and quantum chemistry applications and also in
the quantum autoencoder for data compression, showing successful results in all
cases.</span>

                    <span>The paper deals with the distribution of singular values of the input-output
Jacobian of deep untrained neural networks in the limit of their infinite
width. The Jacobian is the product of random matrices where the independent
rectangular weight matrices alternate with diagonal matrices whose entries
depend on the corresponding column of the nearest neighbor weight matrix. The
problem was considered in \cite{Pe-Co:18} for the Gaussian weights and biases
and also for the weights that are Haar distributed orthogonal matrices and
Gaussian biases. Basing on a free probability argument, it was claimed that in
these cases the singular value distribution of the Jacobian in the limit of
infinite width (matrix size) coincides with that of the analog of the Jacobian
with special random but weight independent diagonal matrices, the case well
known in random matrix theory. The claim was rigorously proved in
\cite{Pa-Sl:21} for a quite general class of weights and biases with i.i.d.
(including Gaussian) entries by using a version of the techniques of random
matrix theory. In this paper we use another version of the techniques to
justify the claim for random Haar distributed weight matrices and Gaussian
biases.</span>

autocorrelation times, some inspired by analytical results derived for the
Metropolized Independent Sampler, which we compare and study as a function of
inverse temperature $\beta$. Based on that we propose an alternative loss
function and study its impact on the autocorelation times. Furthermore, we
investigate the impact of imposing system symmetries ($Z_2$ and/or

times. Eventually, we propose a scheme which incorporates partial heat-bath
updates. The impact of the above enhancements is discussed for a $16 \times 16$

                    <span>We consider the problem of representing causal models that encode
context-specific information for discrete data using a proper subclass of
staged tree models which we call CStrees. We show that the context-specific
information encoded by a CStree can be equivalently expressed via a collection
of DAGs. As not all staged tree models admit this property, CStrees are a
subclass that provides a transparent, intuitive and compact representation of
context-specific causal information. We prove that CStrees admit a global
Markov property which yields a graphical criterion for model equivalence
generalizing that of Verma and Pearl for DAG models. These results extend to
the general interventional model setting, making CStrees the first family of
context-specific models admitting a characterization of interventional model
equivalence. We also provide a closed-form formula for the maximum likelihood
estimator of a CStree and use it to show that the Bayesian information
criterion is a locally consistent score function for this model class. The
performance of CStrees is analyzed on both simulated and real data, where we
see that modeling with CStrees instead of general staged trees does not result
in a significant loss of predictive accuracy, while affording DAG
representations of context-specific causal information.</span>

                    <span>The classical statistical learning theory says that fitting too many
parameters leads to overfitting and poor performance. That modern deep neural
networks generalize well despite a large number of parameters contradicts this
finding and constitutes a major unsolved problem towards explaining the success
of deep learning. The implicit regularization induced by stochastic gradient
descent (SGD) has been regarded to be important, but its specific principle is
still unknown. In this work, we study how the local geometry of the energy
landscape around local minima affects the statistical properties of SGD with
Gaussian gradient noise. We argue that under reasonable assumptions, the local
geometry forces SGD to stay close to a low dimensional subspace and that this
induces implicit regularization and results in tighter bounds on the
generalization error for deep neural networks. To derive generalization error
bounds for neural networks, we first introduce a notion of stagnation sets
around the local minima and impose a local essential convexity property of the
population risk. Under these conditions, lower bounds for SGD to remain in
these stagnation sets are derived. If stagnation occurs, we derive a bound on
the generalization error of deep neural networks involving the spectral norms
of the weight matrices but not the number of network parameters. Technically,
our proofs are based on controlling the change of parameter values in the SGD
iterates and local uniform convergence of the empirical loss functions based on
the entropy of suitable neighborhoods around local minima. Our work attempts to
better connect non-convex optimization and generalization analysis with uniform
convergence.</span>

                    <span>Money laundering is a profound, global problem. Nonetheless, there is little
statistical and machine learning research on the topic. In this paper, we focus
on anti-money laundering in banks. To help organize existing research in the
field, we propose a unifying terminology and provide a review of the
literature. This is structured around two central tasks: (i) client risk
profiling and (ii) suspicious behavior flagging. We find that client risk
profiling is characterized by diagnostics, i.e., efforts to find and explain
risk factors. Suspicious behavior flagging, on the other hand, is characterized
by non-disclosed features and hand-crafted risk indices. Finally, we discuss
directions for future research. One major challenge is the lack of public data
sets. This may, potentially, be addressed by synthetic data generation. Other
possible research directions include semi-supervised and deep learning,
interpretability and fairness of the results.</span>

                    <span>Learning disentangled representations of natural language is essential for
many NLP tasks, e.g., conditional text generation, style transfer, personalized
dialogue systems, etc. Similar problems have been studied extensively for other
forms of data, such as images and videos. However, the discrete nature of
natural language makes the disentangling of textual representations more
challenging (e.g., the manipulation over the data space cannot be easily
achieved). Inspired by information theory, we propose a novel method that
effectively manifests disentangled representations of text, without any
supervision on semantics. A new mutual information upper bound is derived and
leveraged to measure dependence between style and content. By minimizing this
upper bound, the proposed method induces style and content embeddings into two
independent low-dimensional spaces. Experiments on both conditional text
generation and text-style transfer demonstrate the high quality of our
disentangled representation in terms of content and style preservation.</span>

                    <span>Real-world machine learning deployments are characterized by mismatches
between the source (training) and target (test) distributions that may cause
performance drops. In this work, we investigate methods for predicting the
target domain accuracy using only labeled source data and unlabeled target
data. We propose Average Thresholded Confidence (ATC), a practical method that
learns a threshold on the model&#x27;s confidence, predicting accuracy as the
fraction of unlabeled examples for which model confidence exceeds that
threshold. ATC outperforms previous methods across several model architectures,
types of distribution shifts (e.g., due to synthetic corruptions, dataset
reproduction, or novel subpopulations), and datasets (Wilds, ImageNet, Breeds,
CIFAR, and MNIST). In our experiments, ATC estimates target performance
$2$-$4\times$ more accurately than prior methods. We also explore the
theoretical foundations of the problem, proving that, in general, identifying
the accuracy is just as hard as identifying the optimal predictor and thus, the
efficacy of any method rests upon (perhaps unstated) assumptions on the nature
of the shift. Finally, analyzing our method on some toy distributions, we
provide insights concerning when it works.</span>

                    <span>We consider the fixed-budget best arm identification problem in two-armed
Gaussian bandits with unknown variances. The tightest lower bound on the
complexity and an algorithm whose performance guarantee matches the lower bound
have long been open problems when the variances are unknown and when the
algorithm is agnostic to the optimal proportion of the arm draws. In this
paper, we propose a strategy comprising a sampling rule with randomized
sampling (RS) following the estimated target allocation probabilities of arm
draws and a recommendation rule using the augmented inverse probability
weighting (AIPW) estimator, which is often used in the causal inference
literature. We refer to our strategy as the RS-AIPW strategy. In the
theoretical analysis, we first derive a large deviation principle for
martingales, which can be used when the second moment converges in mean, and
apply it to our proposed strategy. Then, we show that the proposed strategy is
asymptotically optimal in the sense that the probability of misidentification
achieves the lower bound by Kaufmann et al. (2016) when the sample size becomes
infinitely large and the gap between the two arms goes to zero.</span>

Scaling large language models has resulted in significant quality improvements natural language understanding (T5), generation (GPT-3) and multilingual neural machine translation (M4). One common approach to building a larger model is to increase the depth (number of layers) and width (layer dimensionality), simply enlarging existing dimensions of the network. Such dense models take an input sequence (divided into smaller components, called tokens) and pass every token through the full network, activating every layer and parameter. While these large, dense models have achieved state-of-the-art results on multiple natural language processing (NLP) tasks, their training cost increase…</span>

 I&#x27;ve developed after my PhD a first version of an algorithm to automatically generate a literature review : https://www.naimai.fr and many remarks were given. I just deployed a new version with much more papers and I&#x27;ll be thankful if you have any remarks about it :)
 More about the new version here : https://yaassinekaddi.medium.com/scientific-literature-generation-ii-73628aebd4fb
 Hopefully that could be useful for the PhDs (and the non PhDs) !

                    <span>Hi,
 I’m part of an art group from Switzerland currently studying at HSLU Design &amp; Arts (https://www.hslu.ch/de-ch/design-kunst/studium/bachelor/camera-arts/).
 The group consists of:
 Karim Beji (https://www.instagram.com/karimbeji_/ https://karimbeji.ch/)
 Emanuel Bohnenblust (https://www.instagram.com/e.bohnenblust/)
 Lea Karabash (https://www.instagram.com/leakarabashian/)
 Yen Shih-hsuan (https://www.instagram.com/shixuan.yan/ http://syen.hfk-bremen.de/)
 At the moment, we are working on a project on the topic if AI can augment the happiness of humans. To answer this question, we are mainly working with chatbots. The end result is going to be an exhibition at the end of March. 
 For that exhibition, we want to conduct a trial in which people from over the world chat with a chatbot to find out if and how it augments the mood of the participants. 
 We would give you access to a GPT-3 (OpenAI) chatbot and ask you to a) record yourself through a webcam (laptop) while you are chatting and b) simultaneously screen record the chat window. 
 In the exhibition we would have a) a book with all the chats and b) small videos with your faces (webcam) to assess your mood. 
 We would have a Zoom meeting beforehand to discuss everything.
 Looking forward to your message!

                    <span>This research service examines the role artificial intelligence (AI) will play in the transformation of the automotive space. AI is a key disruptive technology, wherein automakers are evolving into technology firms and expanding their service offerings beyond manufacturing vehicles.
 Technology implementation has increased, and the post-pandemic situation appears to be positive for all stakeholders; however, automakers have yet to fully harness AI’s potential in their service offerings. Although AI is in the nascent stage of development, OEMs are adopting it across the automotive value chain to improve manufacturing and to enhance customer experience, marketing, sales, and after-sales services. This report examines use cases and business opportunity areas for various players in the automotive ecosystem, including OEMs, Tier I suppliers and technology service providers, and new entrants or start-ups. As the industry continues to evolve, AI capabilities will become the core of automotive solutions. The study identifies key AI trends impacting the industry, including the convergence of connectivity, autonomous, sharing/subscription, and electrification (CASE)

                    <span>The human brain is affected by about 120 different forms of brain tumors. AI-based intervention for tumor identification and surgical pre-assessment is on the verge of becoming a necessity rather than a luxury as we approach the era of artificial intelligence (AI) in healthcare. Brain tumors can be characterized in depth using techniques like volumetric analysis to track their growth and aid in pre-surgical planning.
 The characterization of defined tumors can be directly used for the prognosis of life expectancy, in addition to surgical uses. The segmentation of brain tumors is at the forefront of all such applications. Primary and secondary tumors are the two forms of brain tumors. Primary brain cancers arise from brain cells, whereas secondary tumors spread from other organs to the brain. Continue Reading

I know text to image already exists but I cannot seem to find anything like this, even a more simple version that can process planets or animals or anything, thanks!

                    <span>Alright, so quick disclaimer: I&#x27;m a high-schooler, and probably biting off more than I can chew, but I&#x27;m trying this either way, so please excuse any stupid questions.
 I&#x27;m looking to do sentiment analysis on a number of 7,000+ word long reports that have been released over a period of years to look at the change in sentiment. From what I&#x27;ve done and from what I&#x27;ve seen others do, most sentiment analysis is on text that is much, much shorter (~sentence length). Is there any model that can take text of that length? If not, my other thought was to split each report up into individual sentences, feed those through the model, and average the sentiment for each report. Could that work? Or would the results be utter crap? Are there better ways of tackling this issue?
 Any advice or information would be appreciated, thank you all so much!

It would be cool to do sub-sub classes, like ID Sign-&gt;Speed Limit-&gt;45MPH, but that might be extreme.
 I was thinking running YOLO to do the main class and then piping the results into separate YOLOs might work, but can&#x27;t find much on how that might be done or if it&#x27;s even a good idea. Any guidance would be a great help!!

 I&#x27;m curious to know what everyone does their data processing in? For industry purposes on smaller datasets I&#x27;ve used Pandas and sklearn, while for larger ones I&#x27;ve used Dask.
  
I know that Tensorflow and Pytorch have their own dataloader frameworks but does it scale to large datasets? Say 100GB++? 
 
Do people do data transformations in Jax? 
 
if you had infinite time how would you (re)do your company tech stack? 
 
 My data is 85% timeseries, 10% images, and 5% tabular data.

 I&#x27;ve developed after my PhD a first version of an algorithm to automatically generate a literature review : https://www.naimai.fr and many remarks were given. I just deployed a new version with much more papers and I&#x27;ll be thankful if you have any remarks about it :)
 More about the new version here : https://yaassinekaddi.medium.com/scientific-literature-generation-ii-73628aebd4fb
 Hopefully that could be useful for the PhDs (and the non PhDs) !

Reinforcement Learning (RL) should be better seen as a “fine-tuning” paradigm that can add capabilities to general-purpose pretrained models, rather than a paradigm that can bootstrap intelligence from scratch.

 We’re not just building stuff for 🤗 Transformers users! We have built integrations with open-source libraries such as speechbrain, pyannote, ESPnet, Asteroid and Facebook Fairseq as well as dataset tools.
 Some example models you can try directly in the browser:
  
FastSpeech 2 for Text to Speech
 pyannote Audio Segmentation
 SpeechBrain Language Identification model
 Facebook XLS-R demo to translate your audio from any language to any other target language

 I heard about NeMo from Nvidia, however currently they do not support Dutch? 
 I know that sometimes solutions are not stable and of course it relies on the quality of the recording a lot, but assuming the good quality of the record, etc.

                    <span>tl;dr: There are a variety of BART models for different kinds of data, this article reviews a bunch of them.
 abstract: &quot;Bayesian additive regression trees (BART) is a flexible prediction model/machine learning approach that has gained widespread popularity in recent years. As BART becomes more mainstream, there is an increased need for a paper that walks readers through the details of BART, from what it is to why it works. This tutorial is aimed at providing such a resource. In addition to explaining the different components of BART using simple examples, we also discuss a framework, the General BART model, that unifies some of the recent BART extensions, including semiparametric models, correlated outcomes, statistical matching problems in surveys, and models with weaker distributional assumptions. By showing how these models fit into a single framework, we hope to demonstrate a simple way of applying BART to research problems that go beyond the original independent continuous or binary outcomes framework. &quot;

 How to use transformers for Time-series data? 🤔
  
TLDR: The notebook
  
Rolling Window Setup
  
 
Our data comes in a table. 
 
We want to model a series. (which is not a table)
 
We got a problem. 
 
 In order to solve our problem we will transform the table to the following set-up: Each of our input vectors will be a slice of the dataset representing a rolling-window of N times-steps, For each of these vectors we will also slice a target vector corresponding to the indices of the rolling-window.
 In short, we create the following input and output:
  
X shape: (samples, time-steps, features)
 y shape: (samples, 1)

                    <span>The fit/predict interface introduced by SKLearn have been really successful and have shaped the ML community in the past decade, but lately I am thinking about possible alternatives or extensions.
 The only consistent alternative I found is the Haiku init/apply, and in general the approach of some &quot;pure&quot; JAX projects.
 Do you know any alternative approch? Do you some ideas on what a good &#x27;ML-grammar&#x27; should be?

                    <span>I am currently working on a simple battery management agent (PPO, SB3), which should optimize its charge/discharge under a variety of loads. The agent converges and its actions [-1:discharge entire battery, 1: charge entire battery] are pretty good, but the discharge never matches the load exactly (optimal), there is always a deviation of +-10% or so. 
 Is this something inherent to the algorithm/RL or am I missing something elementary? 
 What Hyperparameter have an influence on the action distribution and are worth experimenting with?
 I tried an env where there is a single obs[0,1] and where the agent needs to output that exact number as its action[0,1] for max rewards and it struggles to achieve this. (accurate to 3-4 decimal points, more accurate with lower learning rate)
 Input would be greatly appreciated!

                    <span>I&#x27;m trying to create a comprehensive list of differences between value-based and policy-based DRL.
 1 The main advantage of learning parameterized policies is that policies can now be any learnable function, whereas value-based methods, in the case of continuous action spaces, are severely limited.
 2 Policy-based methods can more easily learn stochastic policies, which in turn has multiple additional advantages a) Better performance under partially observable environments because we can learn arbitrary probabilities of actions and thus the agent is less dependent on the Markov assumption. In value-based methods we have to force exploration with some probability to ensure optimality, whereas in policy-based methods with stochastic policies, exploration is embedded in the learned function, and converging to a deterministic policy for a given state while training is possible b) It could be more straightforward for function approximation to represent a policy than a value function. Sometimes value functions are too much information for what’s truly needed.
 3 Because policies are parameterized with continuous values, the action probabilities change smoothly as a function of the learned parameters. Therefore, policy-based methods often have better convergence properties.
 4 One of the main advantages of optimizing policies directly is that it’s the right objective. We learn a policy that optimizes the value function directly, without learning a value function, and without taking into account the dynamics of the environment. 
 5 The main advantage of value-based deep reinforcement learning is that they are (usually) off-policy methods and when they work, they tend to be much more sample efficient than policy optimization methods, because they can exploit data from experts or other sources. 
 Do you guys agree with this? Can you think of other points I&#x27;ve surely missed? 
 Thanks!

I am actually interested to know how multiple agents communicate/cooperate to solve a task. How the communication/ cooperation can be modeled.

                    <span>Hi, this might be a longshot but here we go:
  
I have developed a very good hft classification price predictor implemented in tensorflow using some of the modern NLP approaches. HOWEVER, market making is a bit more tricky then that, hence I want to use a RL framework to develop a strategy around it (particularly with focus on inventory management)
 
Does anybody know where to start? I&#x27;ve got a classification model which output (one of three classes) would work as an input signal for a RL strategy as well as the price change over time of the underlying. Metrics could be either PnL etc. I&#x27;ve got billions of data points too. 
 
 Would be grateful if someone can point me into a good direction on where to start (I.e. combining trained SL models with RL) - or if I&#x27;m barking up the wrong tree completely. I Did Supervised learning for a long time, but not RL. Ideally i&#x27;d be looking for a smaller model.

                    <span>Hi guys,
 I have a dc motor Simulink in MATLAB that I want to control using RL(DQN). I implemented my agent, but it always gives me a constant reward. In the training step, the step changed but my reward is constant and gives me a constant reward. Even adding two observations gave me a constant reward while it completed the training steps. Does anybody know the reason for that?

                    <span>We tackle the novel problem of incremental unsupervised domain adaptation
(IDA) in this paper. We assume that a labeled source domain and different
unlabeled target domains are incrementally observed with the constraint that
data corresponding to the current domain is only available at a time. The goal
is to preserve the accuracies for all the past domains while generalizing well
for the current domain. The IDA setup suffers due to the abrupt differences
among the domains and the unavailability of past data including the source
domain. Inspired by the notion of generative feature replay, we propose a novel
framework called Feature Replay based Incremental Domain Adaptation (FRIDA)
which leverages a new incremental generative adversarial network (GAN) called
domain-generic auxiliary classification GAN (DGAC-GAN) for producing
domain-specific feature representations seamlessly. For domain alignment, we
propose a simple extension of the popular domain adversarial neural network
(DANN) called DANN-IB which encourages discriminative domain-invariant and
task-relevant feature learning. Experimental results on Office-Home,
Office-CalTech, and DomainNet datasets confirm that FRIDA maintains superior
stability-plasticity trade-off than the literature.</span>

                    <span>Recently, Learning-based image compression has reached comparable performance
with traditional image codecs(such as JPEG, BPG, WebP). However, computational
complexity and rate flexibility are still two major challenges for its
practical deployment. To tackle these problems, this paper proposes two
universal modules named Energy-based Channel Gating(ECG) and Bit-rate
Modulator(BM), which can be directly embedded into existing end-to-end image
compression models. ECG uses dynamic pruning to reduce FLOPs for more than 50\%
in convolution layers, and a BM pair can modulate the latent representation to
control the bit-rate in a channel-wise manner. By implementing these two

                    <span>Running large-scale pre-trained language models in computationally
constrained environments remains a challenging problem yet to be addressed,
while transfer learning from these models has become prevalent in Natural
Language Processing tasks. Several solutions, including knowledge distillation,
network quantization, or network pruning have been previously proposed;
however, these approaches focus mostly on the English language, thus widening
the gap when considering low-resource languages. In this work, we introduce
three light and fast versions of distilled BERT models for the Romanian
language: Distil-BERT-base-ro, Distil-RoBERT-base, and
DistilMulti-BERT-base-ro. The first two models resulted from the individual
distillation of knowledge from two base versions of Romanian BERTs available in
literature, while the last one was obtained by distilling their ensemble. To
our knowledge, this is the first attempt to create publicly available Romanian
distilled BERT models, which were thoroughly evaluated on five tasks:
part-of-speech tagging, named entity recognition, sentiment analysis, semantic
textual similarity, and dialect identification. Our experimental results argue
that the three distilled models maintain most performance in terms of accuracy
with their teachers, while being twice as fast on a GPU and ~35% smaller. In
addition, we further test the similarity between the predictions of our
students versus their teachers by measuring their label and probability
loyalty, together with regression loyalty - a new metric introduced in this
work.</span>

                    <span>With the preponderance of pretrained deep learning models available
off-the-shelf from model banks today, finding the best weights to fine-tune to
your use-case can be a daunting task. Several methods have recently been
proposed to find good models for transfer learning, but they either don&#x27;t scale
well to large model banks or don&#x27;t perform well on the diversity of
off-the-shelf models. Ideally the question we want to answer is, &quot;given some
data and a source model, can you quickly predict the model&#x27;s accuracy after
fine-tuning?&quot; In this paper, we formalize this setting as &quot;Scalable Diverse
Model Selection&quot; and propose several benchmarks for evaluating on this task. We
find that existing model selection and transferability estimation methods
perform poorly here and analyze why this is the case. We then introduce simple
techniques to improve the performance and speed of these algorithms. Finally,
we iterate on existing methods to create PARC, which outperforms all other
methods on diverse model selection. We have released the benchmarks and method
code in hope to inspire future work in model selection for accessible transfer
learning.</span>

                    <span>We consider an extended notion of reinforcement learning in which the
environment can simulate the agent and base its outputs on the agent&#x27;s
hypothetical behavior. Since good performance usually requires paying attention
to whatever things the environment&#x27;s outputs are based on, we argue that for an
agent to achieve on-average good performance across many such extended
environments, it is necessary for the agent to self-reflect. Thus, an agent&#x27;s
self-reflection ability can be numerically estimated by running the agent
through a battery of extended environments. We are simultaneously releasing an
open-source library of extended environments to serve as proof-of-concept of
this technique. As the library is first-of-kind, we have avoided the difficult
problem of optimizing it. Instead we have chosen environments with interesting
properties. Some seem paradoxical, some lead to interesting thought
experiments, some are even suggestive of how self-reflection might have evolved
in nature. We give examples and introduce a simple transformation which
experimentally seems to increase self-reflection.</span>

retrieved from a large corpus, based on local similarity with preceding tokens.
With a $2$ trillion token database, our Retrieval-Enhanced Transformer (RETRO)
obtains comparable performance to GPT-3 and Jurassic-1 on the Pile, despite
using 25$\times$ fewer parameters. After fine-tuning, RETRO performance
translates to downstream knowledge-intensive tasks such as question answering.
RETRO combines a frozen Bert retriever, a differentiable encoder and a chunked
cross-attention mechanism to predict tokens based on an order of magnitude more
data than what is typically consumed during training. We typically train RETRO
from scratch, yet can also rapidly RETROfit pre-trained transformers with

                    <span>Graph neural networks that leverage coordinates via directional message
passing have recently set the state of the art on multiple molecular property
prediction tasks. However, they rely on atom position information that is often
unavailable, and obtaining it is usually prohibitively expensive or even
impossible. In this paper we propose synthetic coordinates that enable the use
of advanced GNNs without requiring the true molecular configuration. We propose
two distances as synthetic coordinates: Distance bounds that specify the rough
range of molecular configurations, and graph-based distances using a symmetric
variant of personalized PageRank. To leverage both distance and angular
information we propose a method of transforming normal graph neural networks
into directional MPNNs. We show that with this transformation we can reduce the
error of a normal graph neural network by 55% on the ZINC benchmark. We
furthermore set the state of the art on ZINC and coordinate-free QM9 by
incorporating synthetic coordinates in the SMP and DimeNet++ models. Our
implementation is available online.</span>

engagements in education, employment, and entertainment. Despite the
availability of professional and amateur services and tools, most
human-generated descriptions are expensive and time consuming. Moreover, the
rate of human-generated descriptions cannot match the speed of video
production. To overcome the increasing gaps in video accessibility, we
developed a hybrid system of two tools to 1) automatically generate
descriptions for videos and 2) provide answers or additional descriptions in
response to user queries on a video. Results from a mixed-methods study with 26
blind and low vision individuals show that our system significantly improved
user comprehension and enjoyment of selected videos when both tools were used
in tandem. In addition, participants reported no significant difference in
their ability to understand videos when presented with autogenerated

demonstrate user enthusiasm about the developed system and its promise for

                    <span>Neural sequence-to-sequence TTS has achieved significantly better output
quality than statistical speech synthesis using HMMs. However, neural TTS is
generally not probabilistic and the use of non-monotonic attention both
increases training time and introduces &quot;babbling&quot; failure modes that are
unacceptable in production. This paper demonstrates that the old and new
paradigms can be combined to obtain the advantages of both worlds. In
particular, we replace the attention in Tacotron 2 with an autoregressive
left-right no-skip hidden Markov model defined by a neural network. This leads
to an HMM-based neural TTS model with monotonic alignment, trained to maximise
the full sequence likelihood without approximations. We discuss how to combine
innovations from both classical and contemporary TTS for best results. The
final system is smaller and simpler than Tacotron 2, and learns to speak with
fewer iterations and less data, whilst achieving the same naturalness prior to
the post-net. Our approach also allows easy control over speaking rate. Audio

                    <span>Despite the tremendous progress recently made towards automatic sleep staging
in adults, it is currently unknown if the most advanced algorithms generalize
to the pediatric population, which displays distinctive characteristics in
overnight polysomnography (PSG). To answer the question, in this work, we
conduct a large-scale comparative study on the state-of-the-art deep learning
methods for pediatric automatic sleep staging. A selection of six different
deep neural networks with diverging features are adopted to evaluate a sample
of more than 1,200 children across a wide spectrum of obstructive sleep apnea
(OSA) severity. Our experimental results show that the individual performance
of automated pediatric sleep stagers when evaluated on new subjects is
equivalent to the expert-level one reported on adults. Combining the six
stagers into ensemble models further boosts the staging accuracy, reaching an
overall accuracy of 87.7%, a Cohen&#x27;s kappa of 0.837, and a macro F1-score of
84.2% in case of single-channel EEG when evaluated on new subjects. The
performance is further improved when dual-channel EEG$\cdot$EOG are used,
reaching an accuracy of 88.8%, a Cohen&#x27;s kappa of 0.852, and a macro F1-score
of 85.8%. At the same time, the ensemble models lead to reduced predictive
uncertainty. The results also show that the studied algorithms and their
ensembles are robust to concept drift when the training and test data were
recorded 7-months apart and after clinical intervention. Detailed analyses
further demonstrate &quot;almost perfect&quot; agreement between the automatic stagers to
one another and their similar patterns on the staging errors.</span>

                    <span>Logs have been an imperative resource to ensure the reliability and
continuity of many software systems, especially large-scale distributed
systems. They faithfully record runtime information to facilitate system
troubleshooting and behavior understanding. Due to the large scale and
complexity of modern software systems, the volume of logs has reached an
unprecedented level. Consequently, for log-based anomaly detection,
conventional manual inspection methods or even traditional machine
learning-based methods become impractical, which serve as a catalyst for the
rapid development of deep learning-based solutions. However, there is currently
a lack of rigorous comparison among the representative log-based anomaly
detectors that resort to neural networks. Moreover, the re-implementation
process demands non-trivial efforts, and bias can be easily introduced. To
better understand the characteristics of different anomaly detectors, in this
paper, we provide a comprehensive review and evaluation of five popular neural
networks used by six state-of-the-art methods. Particularly, four of the
selected methods are unsupervised, and the remaining two are supervised. These
methods are evaluated with two publicly available log datasets, which contain
nearly 16 million log messages and 0.4 million anomaly instances in total. We
believe our work can serve as a basis in this field and contribute to future
academic research and industrial applications.</span>

                    <span>Sub-optimal control policies in intersection traffic signal controllers (TSC)
contribute to congestion and lead to negative effects on human health and the
environment. Reinforcement learning (RL) for traffic signal control is a
promising approach to design better control policies and has attracted
considerable research interest in recent years. However, most work done in this
area used simplified simulation environments of traffic scenarios to train
RL-based TSC. To deploy RL in real-world traffic systems, the gap between
simplified simulation environments and real-world applications has to be
closed. Therefore, we propose LemgoRL, a benchmark tool to train RL agents as
TSC in a realistic simulation environment of Lemgo, a medium-sized town in
Germany. In addition to the realistic simulation model, LemgoRL encompasses a
traffic signal logic unit that ensures compliance with all regulatory and
safety requirements. LemgoRL offers the same interface as the wellknown OpenAI
gym toolkit to enable easy deployment in existing research work. To demonstrate
the functionality and applicability of LemgoRL, we train a state-of-the-art
Deep RL algorithm on a CPU cluster utilizing a framework for distributed and
parallel RL and compare its performance with other methods. Our benchmark tool
drives the development of RL algorithms towards real-world applications.</span>

                    <span>In this work, we consider the problem of deriving and incorporating accurate
dynamic models for model predictive control (MPC) with an application to
quadrotor control. MPC relies on precise dynamic models to achieve the desired
closed-loop performance. However, the presence of uncertainties in complex
systems and the environments they operate in poses a challenge in obtaining
sufficiently accurate representations of the system dynamics. In this work, we
make use of a deep learning tool, knowledge-based neural ordinary differential
equations (KNODE), to augment a model obtained from first principles. The
resulting hybrid model encompasses both a nominal first-principle model and a
neural network learnt from simulated or real-world experimental data. Using a
quadrotor, we benchmark our hybrid model against a state-of-the-art Gaussian
Process (GP) model and show that the hybrid model provides more accurate
predictions of the quadrotor dynamics and is able to generalize beyond the
training data. To improve closed-loop performance, the hybrid model is
integrated into a novel MPC framework, known as KNODE-MPC. Results show that
the integrated framework achieves 60.2% improvement in simulations and more
than 21% in physical experiments, in terms of trajectory tracking performance.</span>

                    <span>Effectively predicting molecular interactions has the potential to accelerate
molecular dynamics by multiple orders of magnitude and thus revolutionize
chemical simulations. Graph neural networks (GNNs) have recently shown great
successes for this task, overtaking classical methods based on fixed molecular
kernels. However, they still appear very limited from a theoretical
perspective, since regular GNNs cannot distinguish certain types of graphs. In
this work we close this gap between theory and practice. We show that GNNs with
directed edge embeddings and two-hop message passing are indeed universal
approximators for predictions that are invariant to translation, and
equivariant to permutation and rotation. We then leverage these insights and
multiple structural improvements to propose the geometric message passing
neural network (GemNet). We demonstrate the benefits of the proposed changes in
multiple ablation studies. GemNet outperforms previous models on the COLL,
MD17, and OC20 datasets by 34%, 41%, and 20%, respectively, and performs
especially well on the most challenging molecules. Our implementation is

harnessing previous experience from related learning tasks. However, existing
methods have unreliable uncertainty estimates which are often overconfident.
Addressing these shortcomings, we introduce a novel meta-learning framework,
called F-PACOH, that treats meta-learned priors as stochastic processes and
performs meta-level regularization directly in the function space. This allows
us to directly steer the probabilistic predictions of the meta-learner towards
high epistemic uncertainty in regions of insufficient meta-training data and,
thus, obtain well-calibrated uncertainty estimates. Finally, we showcase how
our approach can be integrated with sequential decision making, where reliable

jointly solves the above two issues. Specifically, to address the data-hungry
issue, a small student model is learned with less data by distilling knowledge
from a cumbersome pretrained teacher model. To interpret the teacher model and

                    <span>Optimal pricing, i.e., determining the price level that maximizes profit or
revenue of a given product, is a vital task for the retail industry. To select
such a quantity, one needs first to estimate the price elasticity from the
product demand. Regression methods usually fail to recover such elasticities
due to confounding effects and price endogeneity. Therefore, randomized
experiments are typically required. However, elasticities can be highly
heterogeneous depending on the location of stores, for example. As the
randomization frequently occurs at the municipal level, standard
difference-in-differences methods may also fail. Possible solutions are based
on methodologies to measure the effects of treatments on a single (or just a
few) treated unit(s) based on counterfactuals constructed from artificial
controls. For example, for each city in the treatment group, a counterfactual
may be constructed from the untreated locations. In this paper, we apply a
novel high-dimensional statistical method to measure the effects of price
changes on daily sales from a major retailer in Brazil. The proposed
methodology combines principal components (factors) and sparse regressions,
resulting in a method called Factor-Adjusted Regularized Method for Treatment
evaluation (\texttt{FarmTreat}). The data consist of daily sales and prices of
five different products over more than 400 municipalities. The products
considered belong to the \emph{sweet and candies} category and experiments have
been conducted over the years of 2016 and 2017. Our results confirm the
hypothesis of a high degree of heterogeneity yielding very different pricing
strategies over distinct municipalities.</span>

                    <span>Federated Learning (FL) has been gaining significant traction across
different ML tasks, ranging from vision to keyboard predictions. In large-scale
deployments, client heterogeneity is a fact and constitutes a primary problem
for fairness, training performance and accuracy. Although significant efforts
have been made into tackling statistical data heterogeneity, the diversity in
the processing capabilities and network bandwidth of clients, termed as system
heterogeneity, has remained largely unexplored. Current solutions either
disregard a large portion of available devices or set a uniform limit on the
model&#x27;s capacity, restricted by the least capable participants. In this work,
we introduce Ordered Dropout, a mechanism that achieves an ordered, nested
representation of knowledge in deep neural networks (DNNs) and enables the
extraction of lower footprint submodels without the need of retraining. We
further show that for linear maps our Ordered Dropout is equivalent to SVD. We
employ this technique, along with a self-distillation methodology, in the realm
of FL in a framework called FjORD. FjORD alleviates the problem of client
system heterogeneity by tailoring the model width to the client&#x27;s capabilities.
Extensive evaluation on both CNNs and RNNs across diverse modalities shows that
FjORD consistently leads to significant performance gains over state-of-the-art
baselines, while maintaining its nested structure.</span>

                    <span>Although recent neural text-to-speech (TTS) systems have achieved
high-quality speech synthesis, there are cases where a TTS system generates
low-quality speech, mainly caused by limited training data or information loss
during knowledge distillation. Therefore, we propose a novel method to improve
speech quality by training a TTS model under the supervision of perceptual
loss, which measures the distance between the maximum possible speech quality
score and the predicted one. We first pre-train a mean opinion score (MOS)
prediction model and then train a TTS model to maximize the MOS of synthesized
speech using the pre-trained MOS prediction model. The proposed method can be
applied universally (i.e., regardless of the TTS model architecture or the
cause of speech quality degradation) and efficiently (i.e., without increasing
the inference time or model complexity). The evaluation results for the MOS and
phone error rate demonstrate that our proposed approach improves previous
models in terms of both naturalness and intelligibility.</span>

                    <span>Multimodal sentiment analysis (MSA) is a fundamental complex research problem
due to the heterogeneity gap between different modalities and the ambiguity of
human emotional expression. Although there have been many successful attempts
to construct multimodal representations for MSA, there are still two challenges
to be addressed: 1) A more robust multimodal representation needs to be
constructed to bridge the heterogeneity gap and cope with the complex
multimodal interactions, and 2) the contextual dynamics must be modeled
effectively throughout the information flow. In this work, we propose a
multimodal representation model based on Mutual information Maximization and
Minimization and Identity Embedding (MMMIE). We combine mutual information
maximization between modal pairs, and mutual information minimization between
input data and corresponding features to mine the modal-invariant and
task-related information. Furthermore, Identity Embedding is proposed to prompt
the downstream network to perceive the contextual information. Experimental
results on two public datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed
model.</span>

                    <span>This paper presents an unsupervised segment-based method for robust voice
activity detection (rVAD). The method consists of two passes of denoising
followed by a voice activity detection (VAD) stage. In the first pass,
high-energy segments in a speech signal are detected by using a posteriori
signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) weighted energy difference and if no pitch is
detected within a segment, the segment is considered as a high-energy noise
segment and set to zero. In the second pass, the speech signal is denoised by a
speech enhancement method, for which several methods are explored. Next,
neighbouring frames with pitch are grouped together to form pitch segments, and
based on speech statistics, the pitch segments are further extended from both
ends in order to include both voiced and unvoiced sounds and likely non-speech
parts as well. In the end, a posteriori SNR weighted energy difference is
applied to the extended pitch segments of the denoised speech signal for
detecting voice activity. We evaluate the VAD performance of the proposed
method using two databases, RATS and Aurora-2, which contain a large variety of
noise conditions. The rVAD method is further evaluated, in terms of speaker
verification performance, on the RedDots 2016 challenge database and its
noise-corrupted versions. Experiment results show that rVAD is compared
favourably with a number of existing methods. In addition, we present a
modified version of rVAD where computationally intensive pitch extraction is
replaced by computationally efficient spectral flatness calculation. The
modified version significantly reduces the computational complexity at the cost
of moderately inferior VAD performance, which is an advantage when processing a
large amount of data and running on low resource devices. The source code of
rVAD is made publicly available.</span>

                    <span>Common policy gradient methods rely on the maximization of a sequence of
surrogate functions. In recent years, many such surrogate functions have been
proposed, most without strong theoretical guarantees, leading to algorithms
such as TRPO, PPO or MPO. Rather than design yet another surrogate function, we
instead propose a general framework (FMA-PG) based on functional mirror ascent
that gives rise to an entire family of surrogate functions. We construct
surrogate functions that enable policy improvement guarantees, a property not
shared by most existing surrogate functions. Crucially, these guarantees hold
regardless of the choice of policy parameterization. Moreover, a particular
instantiation of FMA-PG recovers important implementation heuristics (e.g.,
using forward vs reverse KL divergence) resulting in a variant of TRPO with
additional desirable properties. Via experiments on simple bandit problems, we
evaluate the algorithms instantiated by FMA-PG. The proposed framework also
suggests an improved variant of PPO, whose robustness and efficiency we
empirically demonstrate on the MuJoCo suite.</span>

                    <span>Recent works explore learning graph representations in a self-supervised
manner. In graph contrastive learning, benchmark methods apply various graph
augmentation approaches. However, most of the augmentation methods are
non-learnable, which causes the issue of generating unbeneficial augmented
graphs. Such augmentation may degenerate the representation ability of graph
contrastive learning methods. Therefore, we motivate our method to generate
augmented graph by a learnable graph augmenter, called MEta Graph Augmentation
(MEGA). We then clarify that a &quot;good&quot; graph augmentation must have uniformity
at the instance-level and informativeness at the feature-level. To this end, we
propose a novel approach to learning a graph augmenter that can generate an
augmentation with uniformity and informativeness. The objective of the graph
augmenter is to promote our feature extraction network to learn a more
discriminative feature representation, which motivates us to propose a
meta-learning paradigm. Empirically, the experiments across multiple benchmark
datasets demonstrate that MEGA outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in
graph self-supervised learning tasks. Further experimental studies prove the
effectiveness of different terms of MEGA.</span>

                    <span>A data science task can be deemed as making sense of the data or testing a
hypothesis about it. The conclusions inferred from data can greatly guide us to
make informative decisions. Big data has enabled us to carry out countless
prediction tasks in conjunction with machine learning, such as identifying high
risk patients suffering from a certain disease and taking preventable measures.
However, healthcare practitioners are not content with mere predictions - they
are also interested in the cause-effect relation between input features and
clinical outcomes. Understanding such relations will help doctors treat
patients and reduce the risk effectively. Causality is typically identified by
randomized controlled trials. Often such trials are not feasible when
scientists and researchers turn to observational studies and attempt to draw
inferences. However, observational studies may also be affected by selection
and/or confounding biases that can result in wrong causal conclusions. In this
chapter, we will try to highlight some of the drawbacks that may arise in
traditional machine learning and statistical approaches to analyze the
observational data, particularly in the healthcare data analytics domain. We
will discuss causal inference and ways to discover the cause-effect from
observational studies in healthcare domain. Moreover, we will demonstrate the
applications of causal inference in tackling some common machine learning
issues such as missing data and model transportability. Finally, we will
discuss the possibility of integrating reinforcement learning with causality as
a way to counter confounding bias.</span>

                    <span>Bayesian neural networks attempt to combine the strong predictive performance
of neural networks with formal quantification of uncertainty associated with
the predictive output in the Bayesian framework. However, it remains unclear
how to endow the parameters of the network with a prior distribution that is
meaningful when lifted into the output space of the network. A possible
solution is proposed that enables the user to posit an appropriate Gaussian
process covariance function for the task at hand. Our approach constructs a
prior distribution for the parameters of the network, called a ridgelet prior,
that approximates the posited Gaussian process in the output space of the
network. In contrast to existing work on the connection between neural networks
and Gaussian processes, our analysis is non-asymptotic, with finite sample-size
error bounds provided. This establishes the universality property that a
Bayesian neural network can approximate any Gaussian process whose covariance
function is sufficiently regular. Our experimental assessment is limited to a
proof-of-concept, where we demonstrate that the ridgelet prior can out-perform
an unstructured prior on regression problems for which a suitable Gaussian
process prior can be provided.</span>

                    <span>Through the quantification of physical activity energy expenditure (PAEE),
health care monitoring has the potential to stimulate vital and healthy ageing,
inducing behavioural changes in older people and linking these to personal
health gains. To be able to measure PAEE in a monitoring environment, methods
from wearable accelerometers have been developed, however, mainly targeted
towards younger people. Since elderly subjects differ in energy requirements
and range of physical activities, the current models may not be suitable for
estimating PAEE among the elderly. Because past activities influence present
PAEE, we propose a modeling approach known for its ability to model sequential
data, the Recurrent Neural Network (RNN). To train the RNN for an elderly
population, we used the GOTOV dataset with 34 healthy participants of 60 years
and older (mean 65 years old), performing 16 different activities. We used
accelerometers placed on wrist and ankle, and measurements of energy counts by
means of indirect calorimetry. After optimization, we propose an architecture
consisting of an RNN with 3 GRU layers and a feedforward network combining both
accelerometer and participant-level data. In this paper, we describe our
efforts to go beyond the standard facilities of a GRU-based RNN, with the aim
of achieving accuracy surpassing the state of the art. These efforts include
switching aggregation function from mean to dispersion measures (SD, IQR, ...),
combining temporal and static data (person-specific details such as age,
weight, BMI) and adding symbolic activity data as predicted by a previously
trained ML model. The resulting architecture manages to increase its
performance by approximatelly 10% while decreasing training input by a factor
of 10. It can thus be employed to investigate associations of PAEE with
vitality parameters related to metabolic and cognitive health and mental
well-being.</span>

performance of DDPG is usually degraded by unreasonable reward function design,
insufficient training, and low sampling efficiency. In order to solve this kind
of problem, a hybrid car-following strategy based on DDPG and cooperative
adaptive cruise control (CACC) is proposed. First, the car-following process is
modeled as the Markov decision process to calculate CACC and DDPG
simultaneously at each frame. Given a current state, two actions are obtained
from CACC and DDPG, respectively. Then, an optimal action, corresponding to the
one offering a larger reward, is chosen as the output of the hybrid strategy.
Meanwhile, a rule is designed to ensure that the change rate of acceleration is
smaller than the desired value. Therefore, the proposed strategy not only
guarantees the basic performance of car-following through CACC but also makes
full use of the advantages of exploration on complex environments via DDPG.
Finally, simulation results show that the car-following performance of the
proposed strategy is improved compared with that of DDPG and CACC.</span>

                    <span>Quantum computing is the process of performing calculations using quantum
mechanics. This field studies the quantum behavior of certain subatomic
particles for subsequent use in performing calculations, as well as for
large-scale information processing. These capabilities can give quantum
computers an advantage in terms of computational time and cost over classical
computers. Nowadays, there are scientific challenges that are impossible to
perform by classical computation due to computational complexity or the time
the calculation would take, and quantum computation is one of the possible
answers. However, current quantum devices have not yet the necessary qubits and
are not fault-tolerant enough to achieve these goals. Nonetheless, there are
other fields like machine learning or chemistry where quantum computation could
be useful with current quantum devices. This manuscript aims to present a
Systematic Literature Review of the papers published between 2017 and 2021 to
identify, analyze and classify the different algorithms used in quantum machine
learning and their applications. Consequently, this study identified 52
articles that used quantum machine learning techniques and algorithms. The main
types of found algorithms are quantum implementations of classical machine
learning algorithms, such as support vector machines or the k-nearest neighbor
model, and classical deep learning algorithms, like quantum neural networks.
Many articles try to solve problems currently answered by classical machine
learning but using quantum devices and algorithms. Even though results are
promising, quantum machine learning is far from achieving its full potential.
An improvement in the quantum hardware is required since the existing quantum
computers lack enough quality, speed, and scale to allow quantum computing to
achieve its full potential.</span>

                    <span>Capturing the composition patterns of relations is a vital task in knowledge
graph completion. It also serves as a fundamental step towards multi-hop
reasoning over learned knowledge. Previously, several rotation-based
translational methods have been developed to model composite relations using
the product of a series of complex-valued diagonal matrices. However, these
methods tend to make several oversimplified assumptions on the composite
relations, e.g., forcing them to be commutative, independent from entities and
lacking semantic hierarchy. To systematically tackle these problems, we have
developed a novel knowledge graph embedding method, named DensE, to provide an
improved modeling scheme for the complex composition patterns of relations. In
particular, our method decomposes each relation into an SO(3) group-based
rotation operator and a scaling operator in the three dimensional (3-D)
Euclidean space. This design principle leads to several advantages of our
method: (1) For composite relations, the corresponding diagonal relation
matrices can be non-commutative, reflecting a predominant scenario in real
world applications; (2) Our model preserves the natural interaction between
relational operations and entity embeddings; (3) The scaling operation provides
the modeling power for the intrinsic semantic hierarchical structure of
entities; (4) The enhanced expressiveness of DensE is achieved with high
computational efficiency in terms of both parameter size and training time; and
(5) Modeling entities in Euclidean space instead of quaternion space keeps the
direct geometrical interpretations of relational patterns. Experimental results
on multiple benchmark knowledge graphs show that DensE outperforms the current
state-of-the-art models for missing link prediction, especially on composite
relations.</span>

                    <span>Deep learning play a vital role in classifying different arrhythmias using
the electrocardiography (ECG) data. Nevertheless, training deep learning models
normally requires a large amount of data and it can lead to privacy concerns.
Unfortunately, a large amount of healthcare data cannot be easily collected
from a single silo. Additionally, deep learning models are like black-box, with
no explainability of the predicted results, which is often required in clinical
healthcare. This limits the application of deep learning in real-world health
systems. In this paper, we design a new explainable artificial intelligence
(XAI) based deep learning framework in a federated setting for ECG-based
healthcare applications. The federated setting is used to solve issues such as
data availability and privacy concerns. Furthermore, the proposed framework
setting effectively classifies arrhythmia&#x27;s using an autoencoder and a
classifier, both based on a convolutional neural network (CNN). Additionally,
we propose an XAI-based module on top of the proposed classifier to explain the
classification results, which help clinical practitioners make quick and
reliable decisions. The proposed framework was trained and tested using the
MIT-BIH Arrhythmia database. The classifier achieved accuracy up to 94% and 98%
for arrhythmia detection using noisy and clean data, respectively, with
five-fold cross-validation.</span>

                    <span>Emotional voice conversion (EVC) seeks to convert the emotional state of an
utterance while preserving the linguistic content and speaker identity. In EVC,
emotions are usually treated as discrete categories overlooking the fact that
speech also conveys emotions with various intensity levels that the listener
can perceive. In this paper, we aim to explicitly characterize and control the
intensity of emotion. We propose to disentangle the speaker style from
linguistic content and encode the speaker style into a style embedding in a
continuous space that forms the prototype of emotion embedding. We further
learn the actual emotion encoder from an emotion-labelled database and study
the use of relative attributes to represent fine-grained emotion intensity. To
ensure emotional intelligibility, we incorporate emotion classification loss
and emotion embedding similarity loss into the training of the EVC network. As
desired, the proposed network controls the fine-grained emotion intensity in
the output speech. Through both objective and subjective evaluations, we
validate the effectiveness of the proposed network for emotional expressiveness
and emotion intensity control.</span>

problem-solving with a good record of success. This article proposes using
Quantum Computing to improve some of the key processes of CBR, such that a
Quantum Case-Based Reasoning (qCBR) paradigm can be defined. The focus is set
on designing and implementing a qCBR based on the variational principle that
improves its classical counterpart in terms of average accuracy, scalability
and tolerance to overlapping. A comparative study of the proposed qCBR with a
classic CBR is performed for the case of the Social Workers&#x27; Problem as a

                    <span>In biological learning, data are used to improve performance not only on the
current task, but also on previously encountered, and as yet unencountered
tasks. In contrast, classical machine learning starts from a blank slate, or
tabula rasa, using data only for the single task at hand. While typical
transfer learning algorithms can improve performance on future tasks, their
performance on prior tasks degrades upon learning new tasks (called
catastrophic forgetting). Many recent approaches for continual or lifelong
learning have attempted to maintain performance given new tasks. But striving
to avoid forgetting sets the goal unnecessarily low: the goal of lifelong
learning, whether biological or artificial, should be to improve performance on
both past and future tasks with any new data. Our key insight is that we can
ensemble representations learned independently across tasks to transfer
omnidirectionally, that is, jointly improve performance on both future
unforeseen tasks (forward transfer) and past tasks (backward transfer).
Specifically, we propose two lifelong learners: one ensembling trees and the
other ensembling networks. In both cases, the algorithms are able to learn
synergistically, improving performance on both past and future tasks in a
variety of simulated and real data scenarios, including tabular data, image
data, spoken data, and adversarial tasks. Moreover, they can do so with
quasilinear space and time complexity, a requirement for any bona fide lifelong
learning system.</span>

                    <span>Data transformation (DT) is a process that transfers the original data into a
form which supports a particular classification algorithm and helps to analyze
the data for a special purpose. To improve the prediction performance we
investigated various data transform methods. This study is conducted in a
customer churn prediction (CCP) context in the telecommunication industry
(TCI), where customer attrition is a common phenomenon. We have proposed a
novel approach of combining data transformation methods with the machine
learning models for the CCP problem. We conducted our experiments on publicly
available TCI datasets and assessed the performance in terms of the widely used
evaluation measures (e.g. AUC, precision, recall, and F-measure). In this
study, we presented comprehensive comparisons to affirm the effect of the
transformation methods. The comparison results and statistical test proved that
most of the proposed data transformation based optimized models improve the
performance of CCP significantly. Overall, an efficient and optimized CCP model
for the telecommunication industry has been presented through this manuscript.</span>

                    <span>Radio maps find numerous applications in wireless communications and mobile
robotics tasks, including resource allocation, interference coordination, and
mission planning. Although numerous techniques have been proposed to construct
radio maps from spatially distributed measurements, the locations of such
measurements are assumed predetermined beforehand. In contrast, this paper
proposes spectrum surveying, where a mobile robot such as an unmanned aerial
vehicle (UAV) collects measurements at a set of locations that are actively
selected to obtain high-quality map estimates in a short surveying time. This
is performed in two steps. First, two novel algorithms, a model-based online
Bayesian estimator and a data-driven deep learning algorithm, are devised for
updating a map estimate and an uncertainty metric that indicates the
informativeness of measurements at each possible location. These algorithms
offer complementary benefits and feature constant complexity per measurement.
Second, the uncertainty metric is used to plan the trajectory of the UAV to
gather measurements at the most informative locations. To overcome the
combinatorial complexity of this problem, a dynamic programming approach is
proposed to obtain lists of waypoints through areas of large uncertainty in
linear time. Numerical experiments conducted on a realistic dataset confirm
that the proposed scheme constructs accurate radio maps quickly.</span>

                    <span>Next-basket recommendation considers the problem of recommending a set of
items into the next basket that users will purchase as a whole. In this paper,
we develop a novel mixed model with preferences, popularities and transitions
(M2) for the next-basket recommendation. This method models three important
factors in next-basket generation process: 1) users&#x27; general preferences, 2)
items&#x27; global popularities and 3) transition patterns among items. Unlike
existing recurrent neural network-based approaches, M2 does not use the
complicated networks to model the transitions among items, or generate
embeddings for users. Instead, it has a simple encoder-decoder based approach
(ed-Trans) to better model the transition patterns among items. We compared M2
with different combinations of the factors with 5 state-of-the-art next-basket
recommendation methods on 4 public benchmark datasets in recommending the
first, second and third next basket. Our experimental results demonstrate that
M2 significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on all the datasets
in all the tasks, with an improvement of up to 22.1%. In addition, our ablation
study demonstrates that the ed-Trans is more effective than recurrent neural
networks in terms of the recommendation performance. We also have a thorough
discussion on various experimental protocols and evaluation metrics for
next-basket recommendation evaluation.</span>

                    <span>Recently, there has been an explosive growth of mobile and embedded
applications using convolutional neural networks(CNNs). To alleviate their
excessive computational demands, developers have traditionally resorted to
cloud offloading, inducing high infrastructure costs and a strong dependence on
networking conditions. On the other end, the emergence of powerful SoCs is
gradually enabling on-device execution. Nonetheless, low- and mid-tier
platforms still struggle to run state-of-the-art CNNs sufficiently. In this
paper, we present DynO, a distributed inference framework that combines the
best of both worlds to address several challenges, such as device
heterogeneity, varying bandwidth and multi-objective requirements. Key
components that enable this are its novel CNN-specific data packing method,
which exploits the variability of precision needs in different parts of the CNN
when onloading computation, and its novel scheduler that jointly tunes the
partition point and transferred data precision at run time to adapt inference
to its execution environment. Quantitative evaluation shows that DynO
outperforms the current state-of-the-art, improving throughput by over an order
of magnitude over device-only execution and up to 7.9x over competing CNN
offloading systems, with up to 60x less data transferred.</span>

and semantic understanding of the screen. However, UIlayouts in existing
datasets are often noisy, have mismatches withtheir visual representation, or
consists of generic or app-specifictypes that are difficult to analyze and
model. In this paper, wepropose the CLAY pipeline that uses a deep learning
approach fordenoising UI layouts, allowing us to automatically improve
existingmobile UI layout datasets at scale. Our pipeline takes both
thescreenshot and the raw UI layout, and annotates the raw layout byremoving
incorrect nodes and assigning a semantically meaningfultype to each node. To
experiment with our data-cleaning pipeline,we create the CLAY dataset of 59,555
human-annotated screenlayouts, based on screenshots and raw layouts from Rico,
a publicmobile UI corpus. Our deep models achieve high accuracy withF1 scores
of 82.7% for detecting layout objects that do not have avalid visual
representation and 85.9% for recognizing object types,which significantly
outperforms a heuristic baseline. Our work laysa foundation for creating
large-scale high quality UI layout datasetsfor data-driven mobile UI research

                    <span>The combination of Reinforcement Learning (RL) with deep learning has led to
a series of impressive feats, with many believing (deep) RL provides a path
towards generally capable agents. However, the success of RL agents is often
highly sensitive to design choices in the training process, which may require
tedious and error-prone manual tuning. This makes it challenging to use RL for
new problems, while also limits its full potential. In many other areas of
machine learning, AutoML has shown it is possible to automate such design
choices and has also yielded promising initial results when applied to RL.
However, Automated Reinforcement Learning (AutoRL) involves not only standard
applications of AutoML but also includes additional challenges unique to RL,
that naturally produce a different set of methods. As such, AutoRL has been
emerging as an important area of research in RL, providing promise in a variety
of applications from RNA design to playing games such as Go. Given the
diversity of methods and environments considered in RL, much of the research
has been conducted in distinct subfields, ranging from meta-learning to
evolution. In this survey we seek to unify the field of AutoRL, we provide a
common taxonomy, discuss each area in detail and pose open problems which would
be of interest to researchers going forward.</span>

                    <span>We formalize and study the natural approach of designing convex surrogate
loss functions via embeddings, for problems such as classification, ranking, or
structured prediction. In this approach, one embeds each of the finitely many
predictions (e.g.\ rankings) as a point in $\mathbb{R}^d$, assigns the original
loss values to these points, and &quot;convexifies&quot; the loss in some way to obtain a
surrogate. We establish a strong connection between this approach and
polyhedral (piecewise-linear convex) surrogate losses. Given any polyhedral
loss $L$, we give a construction of a link function through which $L$ is a
consistent surrogate for the loss it embeds. Conversely, we show how to
construct a consistent polyhedral surrogate for any given discrete loss. Our
framework yields succinct proofs of consistency or inconsistency of various
polyhedral surrogates in the literature, and for inconsistent surrogates, it
further reveals the discrete losses for which these surrogates are consistent.
We show some additional structure of embeddings, such as the equivalence of
embedding and matching Bayes risks, and the equivalence of various notions of
non-redudancy. Using these results, we establish that indirect elicitation, a
necessary condition for consistency, is also sufficient when working with
polyhedral surrogates.</span>

                    <span>In recent years, multi-modal transformers have shown significant progress in
Vision-Language tasks, such as Visual Question Answering (VQA), outperforming
previous architectures by a considerable margin. This improvement in VQA is
often attributed to the rich interactions between vision and language streams.
In this work, we investigate the efficacy of co-attention transformer layers in
helping the network focus on relevant regions while answering the question. We
generate visual attention maps using the question-conditioned image attention
scores in these co-attention layers. We evaluate the effect of the following
critical components on visual attention of a state-of-the-art VQA model: (i)
number of object region proposals, (ii) question part of speech (POS) tags,
(iii) question semantics, (iv) number of co-attention layers, and (v) answer
accuracy. We compare the neural network attention maps against human attention
maps both qualitatively and quantitatively. Our findings indicate that
co-attention transformer modules are crucial in attending to relevant regions
of the image given a question. Importantly, we observe that the semantic
meaning of the question is not what drives visual attention, but specific
keywords in the question do. Our work sheds light on the function and
interpretation of co-attention transformer layers, highlights gaps in current
networks, and can guide the development of future VQA models and networks that
simultaneously process visual and language streams.</span>

                    <span>Recent multi-task learning research argues against unitary scalarization,
where training simply minimizes the sum of the task losses. Several ad-hoc
multi-task optimization algorithms have instead been proposed, inspired by
various hypotheses about what makes multi-task settings difficult. The majority
of these optimizers require per-task gradients, and introduce significant
memory, runtime, and implementation overhead. We present a theoretical analysis
suggesting that many specialized multi-task optimizers can be interpreted as
forms of regularization. Moreover, we show that, when coupled with standard
regularization and stabilization techniques from single-task learning, unitary
scalarization matches or improves upon the performance of complex multi-task
optimizers in both supervised and reinforcement learning settings. We believe
our results call for a critical reevaluation of recent research in the area.</span>

                    <span>Cardiovascular disease is a large worldwide healthcare issue; symptoms often
present suddenly with minimal warning. The electrocardiogram (ECG) is a fast,
simple and reliable method of evaluating the health of the heart, by measuring
electrical activity recorded through electrodes placed on the skin. ECGs often
need to be analyzed by a cardiologist, taking time which could be spent on
improving patient care and outcomes. Because of this, automatic ECG
classification systems using machine learning have been proposed, which can
learn complex interactions between ECG features and use this to detect
abnormalities. However, algorithms built for this purpose often fail to
generalize well to unseen data, reporting initially impressive results which
drop dramatically when applied to new environments. Additionally, machine
learning algorithms suffer a &quot;black-box&quot; issue, in which it is difficult to
determine how a decision has been made. This is vital for applications in
healthcare, as clinicians need to be able to verify the process of evaluation
in order to trust the algorithm. This paper proposes a method for visualizing
model decisions across each class in the MIT-BIH arrhythmia dataset, using
adapted saliency maps averaged across complete classes to determine what
patterns are being learned. We do this by building two algorithms based on
state-of-the-art models. This paper highlights how these maps can be used to
find problems in the model which could be affecting generalizability and model
performance. Comparing saliency maps across complete classes gives an overall
impression of confounding variables or other biases in the model, unlike what
would be highlighted when comparing saliency maps on an ECG-by-ECG basis.</span>

                    <span>Image quality is a nebulous concept with different meanings to different
people. To quantify image quality a relative difference is typically calculated
between a corrupted image and a ground truth image. But what metric should we
use for measuring this difference? Ideally, the metric should perform well for
both natural and scientific images. The structural similarity index (SSIM) is a
good measure for how humans perceive image similarities, but is not sensitive
to differences that are scientifically meaningful in microscopy. In electron
and super-resolution microscopy, the Fourier Ring Correlation (FRC) is often
used, but is little known outside of these fields. Here we show that the FRC
can equally well be applied to natural images, e.g. the Google Open Images
dataset. We then define a loss function based on the FRC, show that it is
analytically differentiable, and use it to train a U-net for denoising of
images. This FRC-based loss function allows the network to train faster and
achieve similar or better results than when using L1- or L2- based losses. We
also investigate the properties and limitations of neural network denoising
with the FRC analysis.</span>

of all possible stratifications is measured its optimal sample allocation. EDAs
are stochastic black-box optimization algorithms which can be used to estimate,
build and sample probability models in the search for an optimal
stratification. In this paper we enhance the exploitation properties of the EDA
by adding a simulated annealing algorithm to make it a hybrid EDA. Results of
empirical comparisons for atomic and continuous strata show that the HEDA
attains the bests results found so far when compared to benchmark tests on the
same data using a grouping genetic algorithm, simulated annealing algorithm or
hill-climbing algorithm. However, the execution times and total execution are,
in general, higher for the HEDA.</span>

connectivity in healthy children or autistic youths? What patterns in global
trade networks are shared across classes of goods, and how do these patterns
change over time? Answering questions like these requires us to differentially
describe groups of graphs: Given a set of graphs and a partition of these
graphs into groups, discover what graphs in one group have in common, how they
systematically differ from graphs in other groups, and how multiple groups of
graphs are related. We refer to this task as graph group analysis, which seeks
to describe similarities and differences between graph groups by means of
statistically significant subgraphs. To perform graph group analysis, we
introduce Gragra, which uses maximum entropy modeling to identify a
non-redundant set of subgraphs with statistically significant associations to
one or more graph groups. Through an extensive set of experiments on a wide
range of synthetic and real-world graph groups, we confirm that Gragra works

                    <span>Accurate temperature measurements are essential for the proper monitoring and
control of industrial furnaces. However, measurement uncertainty is a risk for
such a critical parameter. Certain instrumental and environmental errors must
be considered when using spectral-band radiation thermometry techniques, such
as the uncertainty in the emissivity of the target surface, reflected radiation
from surrounding objects, or atmospheric absorption and emission, to name a
few. Undesired contributions to measured radiation can be isolated using
measurement models, also known as error-correction models. This paper presents
a methodology for budgeting significant sources of error and uncertainty during
temperature measurements in a petrochemical furnace scenario. A continuous
monitoring system is also presented, aided by a deep-learning-based measurement
correction model, to allow domain experts to analyze the furnace&#x27;s operation in
real-time. To validate the proposed system&#x27;s functionality, a real-world
application case in a petrochemical plant is presented. The proposed solution
demonstrates the viability of precise industrial furnace monitoring, thereby
increasing operational security and improving the efficiency of such
energy-intensive systems.</span>

                    <span>Uncertainty estimation is an essential step in the evaluation of the
robustness for deep learning models in computer vision, especially when applied
in risk-sensitive areas. However, most state-of-the-art deep learning models
either fail to obtain uncertainty estimation or need significant modification
(e.g., formulating a proper Bayesian treatment) to obtain it. Most previous
methods are not able to take an arbitrary model off the shelf and generate
uncertainty estimation without retraining or redesigning it. To address this
gap, we perform a systematic exploration into training-free uncertainty
estimation for dense regression, an unrecognized yet important problem, and
provide a theoretical construction justifying such estimations. We propose
three simple and scalable methods to analyze the variance of outputs from a
trained network under tolerable perturbations: infer-transformation,
infer-noise, and infer-dropout. They operate solely during the inference,
without the need to re-train, re-design, or fine-tune the models, as typically
required by state-of-the-art uncertainty estimation methods. Surprisingly, even
without involving such perturbations in training, our methods produce
comparable or even better uncertainty estimation when compared to
training-required state-of-the-art methods.</span>

                    <span>Existing learning methods for LiDAR-based applications use 3D points scanned
under a pre-determined beam configuration, e.g., the elevation angles of beams
are often evenly distributed. Those fixed configurations are task-agnostic, so
simply using them can lead to sub-optimal performance. In this work, we take a
new route to learn to optimize the LiDAR beam configuration for a given
application. Specifically, we propose a reinforcement learning-based
learning-to-optimize (RL-L2O) framework to automatically optimize the beam
configuration in an end-to-end manner for different LiDAR-based applications.
The optimization is guided by the final performance of the target task and thus
our method can be integrated easily with any LiDAR-based application as a
simple drop-in module. The method is especially useful when a low-resolution
(low-cost) LiDAR is needed, for instance, for system deployment at a massive
scale. We use our method to search for the beam configuration of a
low-resolution LiDAR for two important tasks: 3D object detection and
localization. Experiments show that the proposed RL-L2O method improves the
performance in both tasks significantly compared to the baseline methods. We
believe that a combination of our method with the recent advances of
programmable LiDARs can start a new research direction for LiDAR-based active
perception. The code is publicly available at

                    <span>During recent years, deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has made successful
incursions into complex decision-making applications such as robotics,
autonomous driving or video games. In the search for more sample-efficient
algorithms, a promising direction is to leverage as much external off-policy
data as possible. One staple of this data-driven approach is to learn from
expert demonstrations. In the past, multiple ideas have been proposed to make
good use of the demonstrations added to the replay buffer, such as pretraining
on demonstrations only or minimizing additional cost functions. We present a
new method, able to leverage demonstrations and episodes collected online in
any sparse-reward environment with any off-policy algorithm. Our method is
based on a reward bonus given to demonstrations and successful episodes,
encouraging expert imitation and self-imitation. First, we give a reward bonus
to the transitions coming from demonstrations to encourage the agent to match
the demonstrated behaviour. Then, upon collecting a successful episode, we
relabel its transitions with the same bonus before adding them to the replay
buffer, encouraging the agent to also match its previous successes. Our
experiments focus on manipulation robotics, specifically on three tasks for a 6
degrees-of-freedom robotic arm in simulation. We show that our method based on
reward relabeling improves the performance of the base algorithm (SAC and DDPG)
on these tasks, even in the absence of demonstrations. Furthermore, integrating
into our method two improvements from previous works allows our approach to
outperform all baselines.</span>

                    <span>In many real-world scenarios, we often deal with streaming data that is
sequentially collected over time. Due to the non-stationary nature of the
environment, the streaming data distribution may change in unpredictable ways,
which is known as concept drift. To handle concept drift, previous methods
first detect when/where the concept drift happens and then adapt models to fit
the distribution of the latest data. However, there are still many cases that
some underlying factors of environment evolution are predictable, making it
possible to model the future concept drift trend of the streaming data, while
such cases are not fully explored in previous work.

In this paper, we propose a novel method DDG-DA, that can effectively
forecast the evolution of data distribution and improve the performance of
models. Specifically, we first train a predictor to estimate the future data
distribution, then leverage it to generate training samples, and finally train
models on the generated data. We conduct experiments on three real-world tasks
(forecasting on stock price trend, electricity load and solar irradiance) and
obtain significant improvement on multiple widely-used models.</span>

                    <span>The goal of the state estimation (SE) algorithm is to estimate complex bus
voltages as state variables based on the available set of measurements in the
power system. Because phasor measurement units (PMUs) are increasingly being
used in transmission power systems, there is a need for a fast SE solver that
can take advantage of PMU high sampling rates. This paper proposes training a
graph neural network (GNN) to learn the estimates given the PMU voltage and
current measurements as inputs, with the intent of obtaining fast and accurate
predictions during the evaluation phase. GNN is trained using synthetic
datasets, created by randomly sampling sets of measurements in the power system
and labelling them with a solution obtained using a linear SE with PMUs solver.
The presented results display the accuracy of GNN predictions in various test
scenarios and tackle the sensitivity of the predictions to the missing input
data.</span>

                    <span>Deep reinforcement learning is an increasingly popular technique for
synthesising policies to control an agent&#x27;s interaction with its environment.
There is also growing interest in formally verifying that such policies are
correct and execute safely. Progress has been made in this area by building on
existing work for verification of deep neural networks and of continuous-state
dynamical systems. In this paper, we tackle the problem of verifying
probabilistic policies for deep reinforcement learning, which are used to, for
example, tackle adversarial environments, break symmetries and manage
trade-offs. We propose an abstraction approach, based on interval Markov
decision processes, that yields probabilistic guarantees on a policy&#x27;s
execution, and present techniques to build and solve these models using
abstract interpretation, mixed-integer linear programming, entropy-based
refinement and probabilistic model checking. We implement our approach and
illustrate its effectiveness on a selection of reinforcement learning
benchmarks.</span>

                    <span>End-to-end (E2E) automatic speech recognition models like Recurrent Neural
Networks Transducer (RNN-T) are becoming a popular choice for streaming ASR
applications like voice assistants. While E2E models are very effective at
learning representation of the training data they are trained on, their
accuracy on unseen domains remains a challenging problem. Additionally, these
models require paired audio and text training data, are computationally
expensive and are difficult to adapt towards the fast evolving nature of
conversational speech. In this work, we explore a contextual biasing approach
using likelihood-ratio that leverages text data sources to adapt RNN-T model to
new domains and entities. We show that this method is effective in improving
rare words recognition, and results in a relative improvement of 10% in 1-best
word error rate (WER) and 10% in n-best Oracle WER (n&#x3D;8) on multiple
out-of-domain datasets without any degradation on a general dataset. We also

                    <span>Training deep neural networks on large datasets can often be accelerated by
using multiple compute nodes. This approach, known as distributed training, can
utilize hundreds of computers via specialized message-passing protocols such as
Ring All-Reduce. However, running these protocols at scale requires reliable
high-speed networking that is only available in dedicated clusters. In
contrast, many real-world applications, such as federated learning and
cloud-based distributed training, operate on unreliable devices with unstable
network bandwidth. As a result, these applications are restricted to using
parameter servers or gossip-based averaging protocols. In this work, we lift
that restriction by proposing Moshpit All-Reduce - an iterative averaging
protocol that exponentially converges to the global average. We demonstrate the
efficiency of our protocol for distributed optimization with strong theoretical
guarantees. The experiments show 1.3x speedup for ResNet-50 training on
ImageNet compared to competitive gossip-based strategies and 1.5x speedup when
training ALBERT-large from scratch using preemptible compute nodes.</span>

                    <span>We consider a platform&#x27;s problem of collecting data from privacy sensitive
users to estimate an underlying parameter of interest. We formulate this
question as a Bayesian-optimal mechanism design problem, in which an individual
can share her (verifiable) data in exchange for a monetary reward or services,
but at the same time has a (private) heterogeneous privacy cost which we
quantify using differential privacy. We consider two popular differential
privacy settings for providing privacy guarantees for the users: central and
local. In both settings, we establish minimax lower bounds for the estimation
error and derive (near) optimal estimators for given heterogeneous privacy loss
levels for users. Building on this characterization, we pose the mechanism
design problem as the optimal selection of an estimator and payments that will
elicit truthful reporting of users&#x27; privacy sensitivities. Under a regularity
condition on the distribution of privacy sensitivities we develop efficient
algorithmic mechanisms to solve this problem in both privacy settings. Our
mechanism in the central setting can be implemented in time $\mathcal{O}(n \log
n)$ where $n$ is the number of users and our mechanism in the local setting
admits a Polynomial Time Approximation Scheme (PTAS).</span>

tasks where the underlying data is a graph. However, as GNNs are extensively
used in human-centered applications, the issue of fairness has arisen. While
edge deletion is a common method used to promote fairness in GNNs, it fails to
consider when data is inherently missing fair connections. In this work we
consider the unexplored method of edge addition, accompanied by deletion, to
promote fairness. We propose two model-agnostic algorithms to perform edge
editing: a brute force approach and a continuous approximation approach,
FairEdit. FairEdit performs efficient edge editing by leveraging gradient
information of a fairness loss to find edges that improve fairness. We find
that FairEdit outperforms standard training for many data sets and GNN methods,
while performing comparably to many state-of-the-art methods, demonstrating
FairEdit&#x27;s ability to improve fairness across many domains and models.</span>

high-order modularity information with network features, this paper proposes a
Variational Graph AutoEncoder Reconstruction based community detection VGAER
for the first time, and gives its non-probabilistic version. They do not need
any prior information. We have carefully designed corresponding input features,
decoder, and downstream tasks based on the community detection task and these
designs are concise, natural, and perform well (NMI values under our design are
improved by 59.1% - 565.9%). Based on a series of experiments with wide range

shows strong competitiveness and potential with a simpler design. Finally, we

to search for a domain-invariant representation of the features. The learner
has access to both a labelled source dataset and an unlabeled target dataset

task regressor and a domain classifier Neural Networks. Both models share the

AutoDL challenge series, which helped sorting out a profusion of AutoML
solutions for Deep Learning (DL) that had been introduced in a variety of
settings, but lacked fair comparisons. All input data modalities (time series,
images, videos, text, tabular) were formatted as tensors and all tasks were
multi-label classification problems. Code submissions were executed on hidden
tasks, with limited time and computational resources, pushing solutions that
get results quickly. In this setting, DL methods dominated, though popular
Neural Architecture Search (NAS) was impractical. Solutions relied on
fine-tuned pre-trained networks, with architectures matching data modality.
Post-challenge tests did not reveal improvements beyond the imposed time limit.
While no component is particularly original or novel, a high level modular
organization emerged featuring a &quot;meta-learner&quot;, &quot;data ingestor&quot;, &quot;model
selector&quot;, &quot;model/learner&quot;, and &quot;evaluator&quot;. This modularity enabled ablation
studies, which revealed the importance of (off-platform) meta-learning,
ensembling, and efficient data management. Experiments on heterogeneous module
combinations further confirm the (local) optimality of the winning solutions.

Detecting changes in a data stream is an important problem with many

algorithms which operate in an online setting in the sense that both its
storage requirements and worst-case computational complexity per observation
are independent of the number of previous observations. We propose an online
changepoint detection algorithm for both univariate and multivariate data which
compares favorably with offline changepoint detection algorithms while also
operating in a strictly more constrained computational model. In addition, we

learning with adaptive positive and negative samples (CL-FEFA) that is suitable
for unsupervised, supervised, and semi-supervised single-view feature
extraction. CL-FEFA constructs adaptively the positive and negative samples
from the results of feature extraction, which makes it more appropriate and
accurate. Thereafter, the discriminative features are re extracted to according
to InfoNCE loss based on previous positive and negative samples, which will
make the intra-class samples more compact and the inter-class samples more
dispersed. At the same time, using the potential structure information of
subspace samples to dynamically construct positive and negative samples can
make our framework more robust to noisy data. Furthermore, CL-FEFA considers
the mutual information between positive samples, that is, similar samples in
potential structures, which provides theoretical support for its advantages in
feature extraction. The final numerical experiments prove that the proposed
framework has a strong advantage over the traditional feature extraction
methods and contrastive learning methods.</span>

                    <span>PEPit is a Python package aiming at simplifying the access to worst-case
analyses of a large family of first-order optimization methods possibly
involving gradient, projection, proximal, or linear optimization oracles, along
with their approximate, or Bregman variants.

In short, PEPit is a package enabling computer-assisted worst-case analyses
of first-order optimization methods. The key underlying idea is to cast the
problem of performing a worst-case analysis, often referred to as a performance
estimation problem (PEP), as a semidefinite program (SDP) which can be solved
numerically. For doing that, the package users are only required to write
first-order methods nearly as they would have implemented them. The package
then takes care of the SDP modelling parts, and the worst-case analysis is
performed numerically via a standard solver.</span>

                    <span>In graph analysis, a classic task consists in computing similarity measures
between (groups of) nodes. In latent space random graphs, nodes are associated
to unknown latent variables. One may then seek to compute distances directly in
the latent space, using only the graph structure. In this paper, we show that
it is possible to consistently estimate entropic-regularized Optimal Transport
(OT) distances between groups of nodes in the latent space. We provide a
general stability result for entropic OT with respect to perturbations of the
cost matrix. We then apply it to several examples of random graphs, such as
graphons or $\epsilon$-graphs on manifolds. Along the way, we prove new
concentration results for the so-called Universal Singular Value Thresholding
estimator, and for the estimation of geodesic distances on a manifold.</span>

                    <span>Local Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) with periodic model averaging
(FedAvg) is a foundational algorithm in Federated Learning. The algorithm
independently runs SGD on multiple workers and periodically averages the model
across all the workers. When local SGD runs with many workers, however, the
periodic averaging causes a significant model discrepancy across the workers
making the global loss converge slowly. While recent advanced optimization
methods tackle the issue focused on non-IID settings, there still exists the
model discrepancy issue due to the underlying periodic model averaging. We
propose a partial model averaging framework that mitigates the model
discrepancy issue in Federated Learning. The partial averaging encourages the
local models to stay close to each other on parameter space, and it enables to
more effectively minimize the global loss. Given a fixed number of iterations
and a large number of workers (128), the partial averaging achieves up to 2.2%
higher validation accuracy than the periodic full averaging.</span>

no dedicated work for the classification of beer bottles. As part of the
challenge of the master course Deep Learning, a dataset of 5207 beer bottle
images and brand labels was created. An image contains exactly one beer bottle.
In this paper we present a deep learning model which classifies pictures of
beer bottles in a two step approach. As the first step, a Faster-R-CNN detects
image sections relevant for classification independently of the brand. In the
second step, the relevant image sections are classified by a ResNet-18. The
image section with the highest confidence is returned as class label. We
propose a model, with which we surpass the classic one step transfer learning
approach and reached an accuracy of 99.86% during the challenge on the final

                    <span>This work aims to address the long-established problem of learning
diversified representations. To this end, we combine information-theoretic
arguments with stochastic competition-based activations, namely Stochastic
Local Winner-Takes-All (LWTA) units. In this context, we ditch the conventional
deep architectures commonly used in Representation Learning, that rely on
non-linear activations; instead, we replace them with sets of locally and
stochastically competing linear units. In this setting, each network layer
yields sparse outputs, determined by the outcome of the competition between
units that are organized into blocks of competitors. We adopt stochastic
arguments for the competition mechanism, which perform posterior sampling to
determine the winner of each block. We further endow the considered networks
with the ability to infer the sub-part of the network that is essential for
modeling the data at hand; we impose appropriate stick-breaking priors to this
end. To further enrich the information of the emerging representations, we
resort to information-theoretic principles, namely the Information Competing
Process (ICP). Then, all the components are tied together under the stochastic
Variational Bayes framework for inference. We perform a thorough experimental
investigation for our approach using benchmark datasets on image
classification. As we experimentally show, the resulting networks yield
significant discriminative representation learning abilities. In addition, the
introduced paradigm allows for a principled investigation mechanism of the
emerging intermediate network representations.</span>

                    <span>The imbalanced classification problem turns out to be one of the important
and challenging problems in data mining and machine learning. The performances
of traditional classifiers will be severely affected by many data problems,
such as class imbalanced problem, class overlap and noise. The Tomek-Link
algorithm was only used to clean data when it was proposed. In recent years,
there have been reports of combining Tomek-Link algorithm with sampling
technique. The Tomek-Link sampling algorithm can effectively reduce the class
overlap on data, remove the majority instances that are difficult to
distinguish, and improve the algorithm classification accuracy. However, the
Tomek-Links under-sampling algorithm only considers the boundary instances that
are the nearest neighbors to each other globally and ignores the potential
local overlapping instances. When the number of minority instances is small,
the under-sampling effect is not satisfactory, and the performance improvement
of the classification model is not obvious. Therefore, on the basis of
Tomek-Link, a multi-granularity relabeled under-sampling algorithm (MGRU) is
proposed. This algorithm fully considers the local information of the data set
in the local granularity subspace, and detects the local potential overlapping
instances in the data set. Then, the overlapped majority instances are
eliminated according to the global relabeled index value, which effectively
expands the detection range of Tomek-Links. The simulation results show that
when we select the optimal global relabeled index value for under-sampling, the
classification accuracy and generalization performance of the proposed
under-sampling algorithm are significantly better than other baseline
algorithms.</span>

                    <span>Nowadays, people generate and share massive content on online platforms
(e.g., social networks, blogs). In 2021, the 1.9 billion daily active Facebook
users posted around 150 thousand photos every minute. Content moderators
constantly monitor these online platforms to prevent the spreading of
inappropriate content (e.g., hate speech, nudity images). Based on deep
learning (DL) advances, Automatic Content Moderators (ACM) help human
moderators handle high data volume. Despite their advantages, attackers can
exploit weaknesses of DL components (e.g., preprocessing, model) to affect
their performance. Therefore, an attacker can leverage such techniques to
spread inappropriate content by evading ACM.

In this work, we propose CAPtcha Attack (CAPA), an adversarial technique that
allows users to spread inappropriate text online by evading ACM controls. CAPA,
by generating custom textual CAPTCHAs, exploits ACM&#x27;s careless design
implementations and internal procedures vulnerabilities. We test our attack on
real-world ACM, and the results confirm the ferocity of our simple yet
effective attack, reaching up to a 100% evasion success in most cases. At the
same time, we demonstrate the difficulties in designing CAPA mitigations,
opening new challenges in CAPTCHAs research area.</span>

                    <span>Machine learning has long been considered as a black box for predicting
combustion chemical kinetics due to the extremely large number of parameters
and the lack of evaluation standards and reproducibility. The current work aims
to understand two basic questions regarding the deep neural network (DNN)
method: what data the DNN needs and how general the DNN method can be. Sampling
and preprocessing determine the DNN training dataset, further affect DNN
prediction ability. The current work proposes using Box-Cox transformation
(BCT) to preprocess the combustion data. In addition, this work compares
different sampling methods with or without preprocessing, including the Monte
Carlo method, manifold sampling, generative neural network method (cycle-GAN),
and newly-proposed multi-scale sampling. Our results reveal that the DNN
trained by the manifold data can capture the chemical kinetics in limited
configurations but cannot remain robust toward perturbation, which is
inevitable for the DNN coupled with the flow field. The Monte Carlo and
cycle-GAN samplings can cover a wider phase space but fail to capture
small-scale intermediate species, producing poor prediction results. A
three-hidden-layer DNN, based on the multi-scale method without specific flame
simulation data, allows predicting chemical kinetics in various scenarios and
being stable during the temporal evolutions. This single DNN is readily
implemented with several CFD codes and validated in various combustors,
including (1). zero-dimensional autoignition, (2). one-dimensional freely
propagating flame, (3). two-dimensional jet flame with triple-flame structure,
and (4). three-dimensional turbulent lifted flames. The results demonstrate the
satisfying accuracy and generalization ability of the pre-trained DNN. The
Fortran and Python versions of DNN and example code are attached in the

                    <span>Fair machine learning aims to mitigate the biases of model predictions
against certain subpopulations regarding sensitive attributes such as race and
gender. Among the many existing fairness notions, counterfactual fairness
measures the model fairness from a causal perspective by comparing the
predictions of each individual from the original data and the counterfactuals.
In counterfactuals, the sensitive attribute values of this individual had been
modified. Recently, a few works extend counterfactual fairness to graph data,
but most of them neglect the following facts that can lead to biases: 1) the
sensitive attributes of each node&#x27;s neighbors may causally affect the
prediction w.r.t. this node; 2) the sensitive attributes may causally affect
other features and the graph structure. To tackle these issues, in this paper,
we propose a novel fairness notion - graph counterfactual fairness, which
considers the biases led by the above facts. To learn node representations
towards graph counterfactual fairness, we propose a novel framework based on
counterfactual data augmentation. In this framework, we generate
counterfactuals corresponding to perturbations on each node&#x27;s and their
neighbors&#x27; sensitive attributes. Then we enforce fairness by minimizing the
discrepancy between the representations learned from the original graph and the
counterfactuals for each node. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world
graphs show that our framework outperforms the state-of-the-art baselines in
graph counterfactual fairness, and also achieves comparable prediction
performance.</span>

                    <span>Learning invariant representations is an important requirement when training
machine learning models that are driven by spurious correlations in the
datasets. These spurious correlations, between input samples and the target
labels, wrongly direct the neural network predictions resulting in poor
performance on certain groups, especially the minority groups. Robust training
against these spurious correlations requires the knowledge of group membership
for every sample. Such a requirement is impractical in situations where the
data labeling efforts for minority or rare groups are significantly laborious
or where the individuals comprising the dataset choose to conceal sensitive
information. On the other hand, the presence of such data collection efforts
results in datasets that contain partially labeled group information. Recent
works have tackled the fully unsupervised scenario where no labels for groups
are available. Thus, we aim to fill the missing gap in the literature by
tackling a more realistic setting that can leverage partially available
sensitive or group information during training. First, we construct a
constraint set and derive a high probability bound for the group assignment to
belong to the set. Second, we propose an algorithm that optimizes for the
worst-off group assignments from the constraint set. Through experiments on
image and tabular datasets, we show improvements in the minority group&#x27;s
performance while preserving overall aggregate accuracy across groups.</span>

                    <span>Effective space traffic management requires positive identification of
artificial satellites. Current methods for extracting object identification
from observed data require spatially resolved imagery which limits
identification to objects in low earth orbits. Most artificial satellites,
however, operate in geostationary orbits at distances which prohibit ground
based observatories from resolving spatial information. This paper demonstrates
an object identification solution leveraging modified residual convolutional
neural networks to map distance-invariant spectroscopic data to object
identity. We report classification accuracies exceeding 80% for a simulated
64-class satellite problem--even in the case of satellites undergoing constant,
random re-orientation. An astronomical observing campaign driven by these
results returned accuracies of 72% for a nine-class problem with an average of
100 examples per class, performing as expected from simulation. We demonstrate
the application of variational Bayesian inference by dropout, stochastic weight
averaging (SWA), and SWA-focused deep ensembling to measure classification
uncertainties--critical components in space traffic management where routine
decisions risk expensive space assets and carry geopolitical consequences.</span>

neverending and arbitrary stream of facts and has to decide which ones to
retain in its limited memory. We introduce a mathematical model based on the
online learning framework, in which the learner measures itself against a
collection of experts that are also memory-constrained and that reflect
different policies for what to remember. Interspersed with the stream of facts
are occasional questions, and on each of these the learner incurs a loss if it
has not remembered the corresponding fact. Its goal is to do almost as well as
the best expert in hindsight, while using roughly the same amount of memory. We

al. Self-supervised learning (SSL) is used to learn feature representations of
an image using an unlabeled dataset. This work proposes to use bag-of-words
(BoW) deep feature descriptors as a self-supervised learning target to learn
robust, deep representations. BowNet is trained to reconstruct the histogram of
visual words (ie. the deep BoW descriptor) of a reference image when presented
a perturbed version of the image as input. Thus, this method aims to learn
perturbation-invariant and context-aware image features that can be useful for
few-shot tasks or supervised downstream tasks. In the paper, the author
describes BowNet as a network consisting of a convolutional feature extractor
$\Phi(\cdot)$ and a Dense-softmax layer $\Omega(\cdot)$ trained to predict BoW
features from images. After BoW training, the features of $\Phi$ are used in
downstream tasks. For this challenge we were trying to build and train a

                    <span>Many applications like audio and image processing show that sparse
representations are a powerful and efficient signal modeling technique. Finding
an optimal dictionary that generates at the same time the sparsest
representations of data and the smallest approximation error is a hard problem
approached by dictionary learning (DL). We study how DL performs in detecting
abnormal samples in a dataset of signals. In this paper we use a particular DL
formulation that seeks uniform sparse representations model to detect the
underlying subspace of the majority of samples in a dataset, using a K-SVD-type
algorithm. Numerical simulations show that one can efficiently use this
resulted subspace to discriminate the anomalies over the regular data points.</span>

                    <span>Intelligent systems have the ability to improve their behaviour over time
taking observations, experiences or explicit feedback into account. Traditional
approaches separate the learning problem and make isolated use of techniques
from different field of machine learning such as reinforcement learning, active
learning, anomaly detection or transfer learning, for instance. In this
context, the fundamental reinforcement learning approaches come with several
drawbacks that hinder their application to real-world systems: trial-and-error,
purely reactive behaviour or isolated problem handling. The idea of this
article is to present a concept for alleviating these drawbacks by setting up a
research agenda towards what we call &quot;active reinforcement learning&quot; in
intelligent systems.</span>

                    <span>MRI scan time reduction is commonly achieved by Parallel Imaging methods,
typically based on uniform undersampling of the inverse image space (a.k.a.
k-space) and simultaneous signal reception with multiple receiver coils. The
GRAPPA method interpolates missing k-space signals by linear combination of
adjacent, acquired signals across all coils, and can be described by a
convolution in k-space. Recently, a more generalized method called RAKI was
introduced. RAKI is a deep-learning method that generalizes GRAPPA with
additional convolution layers, on which a non-linear activation function is
applied. This enables non-linear estimation of missing signals by convolutional
neural networks. In analogy to GRAPPA, the convolution kernels in RAKI are
trained using scan-specific training samples obtained from
auto-calibration-signals (ACS). RAKI provides superior reconstruction quality
compared to GRAPPA, however, often requires much more ACS due to its increased
number of unknown parameters. In order to overcome this limitation, this study
investigates the influence of training data on the reconstruction quality for
standard 2D imaging, with particular focus on its amount and contrast
information. Furthermore, an iterative k-space interpolation approach (iRAKI)
is evaluated, which includes training data augmentation via an initial GRAPPA
reconstruction, and refinement of convolution filters by iterative training.
Using only 18, 20 and 25 ACS lines (8%), iRAKI outperforms RAKI by suppressing
residual artefacts occurring at accelerations factors R&#x3D;4 and R&#x3D;5, and yields
strong noise suppression in comparison to GRAPPA, underlined by quantitative
quality metrics. Combination with a phase-constraint yields further
improvement. Additionally, iRAKI shows better performance than GRAPPA and RAKI
in case of pre-scan calibration and strongly varying contrast between training-
and undersampled data.</span>

                    <span>Probabilistic models inform an increasingly broad range of business and
policy decisions ultimately made by people. Recent algorithmic, computational,
and software framework development progress facilitate the proliferation of
Bayesian probabilistic models, which characterise unobserved parameters by
their joint distribution instead of point estimates. While they can empower
decision makers to explore complex queries and to perform what-if-style
conditioning in theory, suitable visualisations and interactive tools are
needed to maximise users&#x27; comprehension and rational decision making under
uncertainty. In this paper, propose a protocol for quantitative evaluation of
Bayesian model visualisations and introduce a software framework implementing
this protocol to support standardisation in evaluation practice and facilitate
reproducibility. We illustrate the evaluation and analysis workflow on a user
study that explores whether making Boxplots and Hypothetical Outcome Plots
interactive can increase comprehension or rationality and conclude with design
guidelines for researchers looking to conduct similar studies in the future.</span>

                    <span>We consider flows of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) driven by path
differentiable vector fields. Path differentiable functions constitute a proper
subclass of Lipschitz functions which admit conservative gradients, a notion of
generalized derivative compatible with basic calculus rules. Our main result
states that such flows inherit the path differentiability property of the
driving vector field. We show indeed that forward propagation of derivatives
given by the sensitivity differential inclusions provide a conservative
Jacobian for the flow. This allows to propose a nonsmooth version of the
adjoint method, which can be applied to integral costs under an ODE constraint.
This result constitutes a theoretical ground to the application of small step
first order methods to solve a broad class of nonsmooth optimization problems
with parametrized ODE constraints. This is illustrated with the convergence of
small step first order methods based on the proposed nonsmooth adjoint.</span>

                    <span>Imaging, scattering, and spectroscopy are fundamental in understanding and
discovering new functional materials. Contemporary innovations in automation
and experimental techniques have led to these measurements being performed much
faster and with higher resolution, thus producing vast amounts of data for
analysis. These innovations are particularly pronounced at user facilities and
synchrotron light sources. Machine learning (ML) methods are regularly
developed to process and interpret large datasets in real-time with
measurements. However, there remain conceptual barriers to entry for the
facility general user community, whom often lack expertise in ML, and technical
barriers for deploying ML models. Herein, we demonstrate a variety of
archetypal ML models for on-the-fly analysis at multiple beamlines at the
National Synchrotron Light Source II (NSLS-II). We describe these examples
instructively, with a focus on integrating the models into existing
experimental workflows, such that the reader can easily include their own ML
techniques into experiments at NSLS-II or facilities with a common
infrastructure. The framework presented here shows how with little effort,
diverse ML models operate in conjunction with feedback loops via integration
into the existing Bluesky Suite for experimental orchestration and data
management.</span>

                    <span>Analyzing large-scale data from simulations of turbulent flows is memory
intensive, requiring significant resources. This major challenge highlights the
need for data compression techniques. In this study, we apply a
physics-informed Deep Learning technique based on vector quantization to
generate a discrete, low-dimensional representation of data from simulations of
three-dimensional turbulent flows. The deep learning framework is composed of
convolutional layers and incorporates physical constraints on the flow, such as
preserving incompressibility and global statistical characteristics of the
velocity gradients. The accuracy of the model is assessed using statistical,
comparison-based similarity and physics-based metrics. The training data set is
produced from Direct Numerical Simulation of an incompressible, statistically
stationary, isotropic turbulent flow. The performance of this lossy data
compression scheme is evaluated not only with unseen data from the stationary,
isotropic turbulent flow, but also with data from decaying isotropic
turbulence, and a Taylor-Green vortex flow. Defining the compression ratio (CR)
as the ratio of original data size to the compressed one, the results show that
our model based on vector quantization can offer CR $&#x3D;85$ with a mean square
error (MSE) of $O(10^{-3})$, and predictions that faithfully reproduce the
statistics of the flow, except at the very smallest scales where there is some
loss. Compared to the recent study based on a conventional autoencoder where
compression is performed in a continuous space, our model improves the CR by
more than $30$ percent, and reduces the MSE by an order of magnitude. Our
compression model is an attractive solution for situations where fast, high
quality and low-overhead encoding and decoding of large data are required.</span>

                    <span>In classic graph signal processing, given a real-valued graph signal, its
graph Fourier transform is typically defined as the series of inner products
between the signal and each eigenvector of the graph Laplacian. Unfortunately,
this definition is not mathematically valid in the cases of vector-valued graph
signals which however are typical operands in the state-of-the-art graph
learning modeling and analyses. Seeking a generalized transformation decoding
the magnitudes of eigencomponents from vector-valued signals is thus the main
objective of this paper. Several attempts are explored, and also it is found
that performing the transformation at hierarchical levels of adjacency help
profile the spectral characteristics of signals more insightfully. The proposed
methods are introduced as a new tool assisting on diagnosing and profiling
behaviors of graph learning models.</span>

                    <span>The use of deep learning for water extraction requires precise pixel-level
labels. However, it is very difficult to label high-resolution remote sensing
images at the pixel level. Therefore, we study how to utilize point labels to
extract water bodies and propose a novel method called the neighbor feature
aggregation network (NFANet). Compared with pixellevel labels, point labels are
much easier to obtain, but they will lose much information. In this paper, we
take advantage of the similarity between the adjacent pixels of a local
water-body, and propose a neighbor sampler to resample remote sensing images.
Then, the sampled images are sent to the network for feature aggregation. In
addition, we use an improved recursive training algorithm to further improve
the extraction accuracy, making the water boundary more natural. Furthermore,
our method utilizes neighboring features instead of global or local features to
learn more representative features. The experimental results show that the
proposed NFANet method not only outperforms other studied weakly supervised
approaches, but also obtains similar results as the state-of-the-art ones.</span>

                    <span>Rule-based classifier, that extract a subset of induced rules to efficiently
learn/mine while preserving the discernibility information, plays a crucial
role in human-explainable artificial intelligence. However, in this era of big
data, rule induction on the whole datasets is computationally intensive. So
far, to the best of our knowledge, no known method focusing on accelerating
rule induction has been reported. This is first study to consider the
acceleration technique to reduce the scale of computation in rule induction. We
propose an accelerator for rule induction based on fuzzy rough theory; the
accelerator can avoid redundant computation and accelerate the building of a
rule classifier. First, a rule induction method based on consistence degree,
called Consistence-based Value Reduction (CVR), is proposed and used as basis
to accelerate. Second, we introduce a compacted search space termed Key Set,
which only contains the key instances required to update the induced rule, to
conduct value reduction. The monotonicity of Key Set ensures the feasibility of
our accelerator. Third, a rule-induction accelerator is designed based on Key
Set, and it is theoretically guaranteed to display the same results as the
unaccelerated version. Specifically, the rank preservation property of Key Set
ensures consistency between the rule induction achieved by the accelerator and
the unaccelerated method. Finally, extensive experiments demonstrate that the
proposed accelerator can perform remarkably faster than the unaccelerated
rule-based classifier methods, especially on datasets with numerous instances.</span>

                    <span>The recent trend of integrating multi-source Chest X-Ray datasets to improve
automated diagnostics raises concerns that models learn to exploit
source-specific correlations to improve performance by recognizing the source
domain of an image rather than the medical pathology. We hypothesize that this
effect is enforced by and leverages label-imbalance across the source domains,
i.e, prevalence of a disease corresponding to a source. Therefore, in this
work, we perform a thorough study of the effect of label-imbalance in
multi-source training for the task of pneumonia detection on the widely used
ChestX-ray14 and CheXpert datasets. The results highlight and stress the
importance of using more faithful and transparent self-explaining models for
automated diagnosis, thus enabling the inherent detection of spurious learning.
They further illustrate that this undesirable effect of learning spurious
correlations can be reduced considerably when ensuring label-balanced source
domain datasets.</span>

                    <span>In this paper, we contribute a multi-faceted study into Pavlovian signalling
-- a process by which learned, temporally extended predictions made by one
agent inform decision-making by another agent. Signalling is intimately
connected to time and timing. In service of generating and receiving signals,
humans and other animals are known to represent time, determine time since past
events, predict the time until a future stimulus, and both recognize and
generate patterns that unfold in time. We investigate how different temporal
processes impact coordination and signalling between learning agents by
introducing a partially observable decision-making domain we call the Frost
Hollow. In this domain, a prediction learning agent and a reinforcement
learning agent are coupled into a two-part decision-making system that works to
acquire sparse reward while avoiding time-conditional hazards. We evaluate two
domain variations: machine agents interacting in a seven-state linear walk, and
human-machine interaction in a virtual-reality environment. Our results
showcase the speed of learning for Pavlovian signalling, the impact that
different temporal representations do (and do not) have on agent-agent
coordination, and how temporal aliasing impacts agent-agent and human-agent
interactions differently. As a main contribution, we establish Pavlovian
signalling as a natural bridge between fixed signalling paradigms and fully
adaptive communication learning between two agents. We further show how to
computationally build this adaptive signalling process out of a fixed
signalling process, characterized by fast continual prediction learning and
minimal constraints on the nature of the agent receiving signals. Our results
therefore suggest an actionable, constructivist path towards communication
learning between reinforcement learning agents.</span>

                    <span>When data are scarce meta-learning can improve a learner&#x27;s accuracy by
harnessing previous experience from related learning tasks. However, existing
methods have unreliable uncertainty estimates which are often overconfident.
Addressing these shortcomings, we introduce a novel meta-learning framework,
called F-PACOH, that treats meta-learned priors as stochastic processes and
performs meta-level regularization directly in the function space. This allows
us to directly steer the probabilistic predictions of the meta-learner towards
high epistemic uncertainty in regions of insufficient meta-training data and,
thus, obtain well-calibrated uncertainty estimates. Finally, we showcase how
our approach can be integrated with sequential decision making, where reliable
uncertainty quantification is imperative. In our benchmark study on
meta-learning for Bayesian Optimization (BO), F-PACOH significantly outperforms
all other meta-learners and standard baselines.</span>

                    <span>Effectively predicting molecular interactions has the potential to accelerate
molecular dynamics by multiple orders of magnitude and thus revolutionize
chemical simulations. Graph neural networks (GNNs) have recently shown great
successes for this task, overtaking classical methods based on fixed molecular
kernels. However, they still appear very limited from a theoretical
perspective, since regular GNNs cannot distinguish certain types of graphs. In
this work we close this gap between theory and practice. We show that GNNs with
directed edge embeddings and two-hop message passing are indeed universal
approximators for predictions that are invariant to translation, and
equivariant to permutation and rotation. We then leverage these insights and
multiple structural improvements to propose the geometric message passing
neural network (GemNet). We demonstrate the benefits of the proposed changes in
multiple ablation studies. GemNet outperforms previous models on the COLL,
MD17, and OC20 datasets by 34%, 41%, and 20%, respectively, and performs
especially well on the most challenging molecules. Our implementation is
available online.</span>

                    <span>Generalised Bayesian inference updates prior beliefs using a loss function,
rather than a likelihood, and can therefore be used to confer robustness
against possible mis-specification of the likelihood. Here we consider
generalised Bayesian inference with a Stein discrepancy as a loss function,
motivated by applications in which the likelihood contains an intractable
normalisation constant. In this context, the Stein discrepancy circumvents
evaluation of the normalisation constant and produces generalised posteriors
that are either closed form or accessible using standard Markov chain Monte
Carlo. On a theoretical level, we show consistency, asymptotic normality, and
bias-robustness of the generalised posterior, highlighting how these properties
are impacted by the choice of Stein discrepancy. Then, we provide numerical
experiments on a range of intractable distributions, including applications to
kernel-based exponential family models and non-Gaussian graphical models.</span>

                    <span>Since the seminal work of Venkatakrishnan et al. (2013), Plug &amp; Play (PnP)
methods have become ubiquitous in Bayesian imaging. These methods derive
Minimum Mean Square Error (MMSE) or Maximum A Posteriori (MAP) estimators for
inverse problems in imaging by combining an explicit likelihood function with a
prior that is implicitly defined by an image denoising algorithm. The PnP
algorithms proposed in the literature mainly differ in the iterative schemes
they use for optimisation or for sampling. In the case of optimisation schemes,
some recent works guarantee the convergence to a fixed point, albeit not
necessarily a MAP estimate. In the case of sampling schemes, to the best of our
knowledge, there is no known proof of convergence. There also remain important
open questions regarding whether the underlying Bayesian models and estimators
are well defined, well-posed, and have the basic regularity properties required
to support these numerical schemes. To address these limitations, this paper
develops theory, methods, and provably convergent algorithms for performing
Bayesian inference with PnP priors. We introduce two algorithms: 1) PnP-ULA
(Unadjusted Langevin Algorithm) for Monte Carlo sampling and MMSE inference;
and 2) PnP-SGD (Stochastic Gradient Descent) for MAP inference. Using recent
results on the quantitative convergence of Markov chains, we establish detailed
convergence guarantees for these two algorithms under realistic assumptions on
the denoising operators used, with special attention to denoisers based on deep
neural networks. We also show that these algorithms approximately target a
decision-theoretically optimal Bayesian model that is well-posed. The proposed
algorithms are demonstrated on several canonical problems such as image
deblurring, inpainting, and denoising, where they are used for point estimation
as well as for uncertainty visualisation and quantification.</span>

                    <span>The use of heuristics to assess the convergence and compress the output of
Markov chain Monte Carlo can be sub-optimal in terms of the empirical
approximations that are produced. Typically a number of the initial states are
attributed to &quot;burn in&quot; and removed, whilst the remainder of the chain is
&quot;thinned&quot; if compression is also required. In this paper we consider the
problem of retrospectively selecting a subset of states, of fixed cardinality,
from the sample path such that the approximation provided by their empirical
distribution is close to optimal. A novel method is proposed, based on greedy
minimisation of a kernel Stein discrepancy, that is suitable for problems where
heavy compression is required. Theoretical results guarantee consistency of the
method and its effectiveness is demonstrated in the challenging context of
parameter inference for ordinary differential equations. Software is available
in the Stein Thinning package in Python, R and MATLAB.</span>

                    <span>In biological learning, data are used to improve performance not only on the
current task, but also on previously encountered, and as yet unencountered
tasks. In contrast, classical machine learning starts from a blank slate, or
tabula rasa, using data only for the single task at hand. While typical
transfer learning algorithms can improve performance on future tasks, their
performance on prior tasks degrades upon learning new tasks (called
catastrophic forgetting). Many recent approaches for continual or lifelong
learning have attempted to maintain performance given new tasks. But striving
to avoid forgetting sets the goal unnecessarily low: the goal of lifelong
learning, whether biological or artificial, should be to improve performance on
both past and future tasks with any new data. Our key insight is that we can
ensemble representations learned independently across tasks to transfer
omnidirectionally, that is, jointly improve performance on both future
unforeseen tasks (forward transfer) and past tasks (backward transfer).
Specifically, we propose two lifelong learners: one ensembling trees and the
other ensembling networks. In both cases, the algorithms are able to learn
synergistically, improving performance on both past and future tasks in a
variety of simulated and real data scenarios, including tabular data, image
data, spoken data, and adversarial tasks. Moreover, they can do so with
quasilinear space and time complexity, a requirement for any bona fide lifelong
learning system.</span>

neverending and arbitrary stream of facts and has to decide which ones to
retain in its limited memory. We introduce a mathematical model based on the
online learning framework, in which the learner measures itself against a
collection of experts that are also memory-constrained and that reflect
different policies for what to remember. Interspersed with the stream of facts
are occasional questions, and on each of these the learner incurs a loss if it
has not remembered the corresponding fact. Its goal is to do almost as well as
the best expert in hindsight, while using roughly the same amount of memory. We
identify difficulties with using the multiplicative weights update algorithm in
this memory-constrained scenario, and design an alternative scheme whose regret
guarantees are close to the best possible.</span>

                    <span>Optimal pricing, i.e., determining the price level that maximizes profit or
revenue of a given product, is a vital task for the retail industry. To select
such a quantity, one needs first to estimate the price elasticity from the
product demand. Regression methods usually fail to recover such elasticities
due to confounding effects and price endogeneity. Therefore, randomized
experiments are typically required. However, elasticities can be highly
heterogeneous depending on the location of stores, for example. As the
randomization frequently occurs at the municipal level, standard
difference-in-differences methods may also fail. Possible solutions are based
on methodologies to measure the effects of treatments on a single (or just a
few) treated unit(s) based on counterfactuals constructed from artificial
controls. For example, for each city in the treatment group, a counterfactual
may be constructed from the untreated locations. In this paper, we apply a
novel high-dimensional statistical method to measure the effects of price
changes on daily sales from a major retailer in Brazil. The proposed
methodology combines principal components (factors) and sparse regressions,
resulting in a method called Factor-Adjusted Regularized Method for Treatment
evaluation (\texttt{FarmTreat}). The data consist of daily sales and prices of
five different products over more than 400 municipalities. The products
considered belong to the \emph{sweet and candies} category and experiments have
been conducted over the years of 2016 and 2017. Our results confirm the
hypothesis of a high degree of heterogeneity yielding very different pricing
strategies over distinct municipalities.</span>

                    <span>Bayesian neural networks attempt to combine the strong predictive performance
of neural networks with formal quantification of uncertainty associated with
the predictive output in the Bayesian framework. However, it remains unclear
how to endow the parameters of the network with a prior distribution that is
meaningful when lifted into the output space of the network. A possible
solution is proposed that enables the user to posit an appropriate Gaussian
process covariance function for the task at hand. Our approach constructs a
prior distribution for the parameters of the network, called a ridgelet prior,
that approximates the posited Gaussian process in the output space of the
network. In contrast to existing work on the connection between neural networks
and Gaussian processes, our analysis is non-asymptotic, with finite sample-size
error bounds provided. This establishes the universality property that a
Bayesian neural network can approximate any Gaussian process whose covariance
function is sufficiently regular. Our experimental assessment is limited to a
proof-of-concept, where we demonstrate that the ridgelet prior can out-perform
an unstructured prior on regression problems for which a suitable Gaussian
process prior can be provided.</span>

                    <span>Next-basket recommendation considers the problem of recommending a set of
items into the next basket that users will purchase as a whole. In this paper,
we develop a novel mixed model with preferences, popularities and transitions
(M2) for the next-basket recommendation. This method models three important
factors in next-basket generation process: 1) users&#x27; general preferences, 2)
items&#x27; global popularities and 3) transition patterns among items. Unlike
existing recurrent neural network-based approaches, M2 does not use the
complicated networks to model the transitions among items, or generate
embeddings for users. Instead, it has a simple encoder-decoder based approach
(ed-Trans) to better model the transition patterns among items. We compared M2
with different combinations of the factors with 5 state-of-the-art next-basket
recommendation methods on 4 public benchmark datasets in recommending the
first, second and third next basket. Our experimental results demonstrate that
M2 significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on all the datasets
in all the tasks, with an improvement of up to 22.1%. In addition, our ablation
study demonstrates that the ed-Trans is more effective than recurrent neural
networks in terms of the recommendation performance. We also have a thorough
discussion on various experimental protocols and evaluation metrics for
next-basket recommendation evaluation.</span>

                    <span>Common policy gradient methods rely on the maximization of a sequence of
surrogate functions. In recent years, many such surrogate functions have been
proposed, most without strong theoretical guarantees, leading to algorithms
such as TRPO, PPO or MPO. Rather than design yet another surrogate function, we
instead propose a general framework (FMA-PG) based on functional mirror ascent
that gives rise to an entire family of surrogate functions. We construct
surrogate functions that enable policy improvement guarantees, a property not
shared by most existing surrogate functions. Crucially, these guarantees hold
regardless of the choice of policy parameterization. Moreover, a particular
instantiation of FMA-PG recovers important implementation heuristics (e.g.,
using forward vs reverse KL divergence) resulting in a variant of TRPO with
additional desirable properties. Via experiments on simple bandit problems, we
evaluate the algorithms instantiated by FMA-PG. The proposed framework also
suggests an improved variant of PPO, whose robustness and efficiency we
empirically demonstrate on the MuJoCo suite.</span>

                    <span>This work aims to address the long-established problem of learning
diversified representations. To this end, we combine information-theoretic
arguments with stochastic competition-based activations, namely Stochastic
Local Winner-Takes-All (LWTA) units. In this context, we ditch the conventional
deep architectures commonly used in Representation Learning, that rely on
non-linear activations; instead, we replace them with sets of locally and
stochastically competing linear units. In this setting, each network layer
yields sparse outputs, determined by the outcome of the competition between
units that are organized into blocks of competitors. We adopt stochastic
arguments for the competition mechanism, which perform posterior sampling to
determine the winner of each block. We further endow the considered networks
with the ability to infer the sub-part of the network that is essential for
modeling the data at hand; we impose appropriate stick-breaking priors to this
end. To further enrich the information of the emerging representations, we
resort to information-theoretic principles, namely the Information Competing
Process (ICP). Then, all the components are tied together under the stochastic
Variational Bayes framework for inference. We perform a thorough experimental
investigation for our approach using benchmark datasets on image
classification. As we experimentally show, the resulting networks yield
significant discriminative representation learning abilities. In addition, the
introduced paradigm allows for a principled investigation mechanism of the
emerging intermediate network representations.</span>

                    <span>Learning invariant representations is an important requirement when training
machine learning models that are driven by spurious correlations in the
datasets. These spurious correlations, between input samples and the target
labels, wrongly direct the neural network predictions resulting in poor
performance on certain groups, especially the minority groups. Robust training
against these spurious correlations requires the knowledge of group membership
for every sample. Such a requirement is impractical in situations where the
data labeling efforts for minority or rare groups are significantly laborious
or where the individuals comprising the dataset choose to conceal sensitive
information. On the other hand, the presence of such data collection efforts
results in datasets that contain partially labeled group information. Recent
works have tackled the fully unsupervised scenario where no labels for groups
are available. Thus, we aim to fill the missing gap in the literature by
tackling a more realistic setting that can leverage partially available
sensitive or group information during training. First, we construct a
constraint set and derive a high probability bound for the group assignment to
belong to the set. Second, we propose an algorithm that optimizes for the
worst-off group assignments from the constraint set. Through experiments on
image and tabular datasets, we show improvements in the minority group&#x27;s
performance while preserving overall aggregate accuracy across groups.</span>

between (groups of) nodes. In latent space random graphs, nodes are associated
to unknown latent variables. One may then seek to compute distances directly in
the latent space, using only the graph structure. In this paper, we show that
it is possible to consistently estimate entropic-regularized Optimal Transport
(OT) distances between groups of nodes in the latent space. We provide a
general stability result for entropic OT with respect to perturbations of the
cost matrix. We then apply it to several examples of random graphs, such as
graphons or $\epsilon$-graphs on manifolds. Along the way, we prove new
concentration results for the so-called Universal Singular Value Thresholding

                    <span>Local Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) with periodic model averaging
(FedAvg) is a foundational algorithm in Federated Learning. The algorithm
independently runs SGD on multiple workers and periodically averages the model
across all the workers. When local SGD runs with many workers, however, the
periodic averaging causes a significant model discrepancy across the workers
making the global loss converge slowly. While recent advanced optimization
methods tackle the issue focused on non-IID settings, there still exists the
model discrepancy issue due to the underlying periodic model averaging. We
propose a partial model averaging framework that mitigates the model
discrepancy issue in Federated Learning. The partial averaging encourages the
local models to stay close to each other on parameter space, and it enables to
more effectively minimize the global loss. Given a fixed number of iterations
and a large number of workers (128), the partial averaging achieves up to 2.2%
higher validation accuracy than the periodic full averaging.</span>

predictions (e.g.\ rankings) as a point in $\mathbb{R}^d$, assigns the original
loss values to these points, and &quot;convexifies&quot; the loss in some way to obtain a
surrogate. We establish a strong connection between this approach and
polyhedral (piecewise-linear convex) surrogate losses. Given any polyhedral
loss $L$, we give a construction of a link function through which $L$ is a
consistent surrogate for the loss it embeds. Conversely, we show how to
construct a consistent polyhedral surrogate for any given discrete loss. Our
framework yields succinct proofs of consistency or inconsistency of various
polyhedral surrogates in the literature, and for inconsistent surrogates, it
further reveals the discrete losses for which these surrogates are consistent.
We show some additional structure of embeddings, such as the equivalence of
embedding and matching Bayes risks, and the equivalence of various notions of
non-redudancy. Using these results, we establish that indirect elicitation, a
necessary condition for consistency, is also sufficient when working with
polyhedral surrogates.</span>

Advances in deep learning over the last few decades have been driven by a few key elements. With a small number of simple but flexible mechanisms (i.e., inductive biases such as convolutions or sequence attention), increasingly large datasets, and more specialized hardware, neural networks can now achieve impressive results on a wide range of tasks, such as image classification, machine translation, and protein folding prediction. 
However, the use of large models and datasets comes at the expense of significant computational requirements. Yet, recent works suggest that large model sizes might be necessary for strong generalization and robustness, so training large models whil…</span>

                    <span>There&#x27;s plenty of software out there that can clone another person&#x27;s voice. And there&#x27;s even some software that acts as a voice changer, mapping another person&#x27;s voice to your performance.
 What I would like is voice changing software that allows you to edit and save a fully custom voice.
 It could be used for personal animation and video game projects.
 ​
 There is the concern of how this might effect the careers of people in the voice acting business. . . 
 But I figure that making a professional acting performance would still be a valuable service.
 And either way, I find it might be equally questionable to restrict the advancement of technology to preserve anyone&#x27;s monopoly.

                    <span>I am running some evaluation metrics using the YOLOv5 object detection algorithm, and wish to calculate my true positives and false positives. For instance, the evaluation metric outputs are as follows: 
  Class Images Labels Prec Recall mAP@.5 mAP@.5:.95: all 100 36 0.444 0.702 0.481 0.223 Class 1 50 29 0.588 0.689 0.668 0.333 Class 2 50 7 0.301 0.714 0.293 0.113 
 Looking at this source (https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5/issues/5713), I found that you could calculate the true positives and false positives with the following equations:
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 Computed for Class 1
 TP &#x3D; Recall * Labels &#x3D; 34.45 ≈ 34 FP &#x3D; (TP / Precision) - TP &#x3D; 23.82 ≈ 24 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 I am new to evaluation metrics, so at first glance, I&#x27;m thinking that the false positive number is fairly high. Is this the correct formula to compute the true positives and false positives? I&#x27;m just looking for some verification and some explanation as to why this works, if it does.

 Title: The Turing Trap: The Promise &amp; Peril of Human-Like Artificial Intelligence
 Authors: Erik Brynjolfsson
 Categories: econ.GN cs.AI cs.CY cs.LG q-fin.EC 
 Comments: Forthcoming in Daedalus, April 2022. Posted with permission MSC-class: 91 ACM-class: K.4.0; K.4.2 \\ 
 In 1950, Alan Turing proposed an imitation game as the ultimate test of whether a machine was intelligent: could a machine imitate a human so well that its answers to questions indistinguishable from a human. Ever since, creating intelligence that matches human intelligence has implicitly or explicitly been the goal of thousands of researchers, engineers, and entrepreneurs. The benefits of human-like artificial intelligence (HLAI) include soaring productivity, increased leisure, and perhaps most profoundly, a better understanding of our own minds. But not all types of AI are human-like. In fact, many of the most powerful systems are very different from humans. So an excessive focus on developing and deploying HLAI can lead us into a trap. As machines become better substitutes for human labor, workers lose economic and political bargaining power and become increasingly dependent on those who control the technology. In contrast, when AI is focused on augmenting humans rather than mimicking them, then humans retain the power to insist on a share of the value created. Furthermore, augmentation creates new capabilities and new products and services, ultimately generating far more value than merely human-like AI. While both types of AI can be enormously beneficial, there are currently excess incentives for automation rather than augmentation among technologists, business executives, and policymakers. \\

                    <span>Hi, I&#x27;m the maker of SpeechPro, a niche job board for Speech AI tech professionals. I&#x27;ve just added a page listing all the Speech/NLU SaaS companies.
 SpeechPro company list screenshot
 It&#x27;s a growing list and I&#x27;ll keep updating it. Right now there are 50 and most of them are ASR/TTS/NLU/CAI related. Considering that ASR and TTS are essential parts for the Human-Machine interface, Speech SaaS companies might gain more popularity in this #Metaverse trend.
 Hope this company list can be helpful. Thanks.

                    <span>Hi r/machinelearning,
 For the past 1.5 years I have been organizing an online journal club on the topic of Graph Representation Learning. We meet either weekly or fortnightly via Zoom to discuss a relevant paper.
 We are a small and friendly group and we would like to invite others who have similar interests to join us.
 We meet on Thursdays, 6:00pm-7:30pm, Canada/Pacific timezone, and out next meeting is on January 20, 2022.
 You are welcome to join us here.
 Cheers!

 Last month I did an experiment with AI-Generated Pokémon on a fine trained ruDALL-E that went unexpectedly viral. Today, I&#x27;ve open-sourced the finetuned model and released a Colab Notebook that lets you generate Pokemon with just two clicks. Also, I added an infinite generation feature which works surprisingly well!

                    <span>I&#x27;m currently working a problem where I&#x27;m attempting to reconstruct 1x600 long Fourier vectors using an Autoencoder, where each element in the vector is a frequency (increasing sequentially). I have a set of 17,000 spectra which I apply Numpy&#x27;s rfft to obtain the corresponding Fourier vector. After transforming all of my data, I use an sklearn StandardScaler() to Standardize each column (frequency). From here, I am training my NN on this Standardized data. I have created plots of two samples from my data for illustration purposes.

                    <span>I work at a start-up as the sole machine learning engineer, and I have been tasked to develop a state-of-the-art model on a domain specific problem.
 Some information on the task:
  
Computer vision problem - complex keypoint localisation / 3D mesh prediction
 No training data - I&#x27;m proposing that I build a synthetic data pipeline supplemented with real-world data.
  
I feel like there is too much for me to be doing at once: reading papers, writing plans and documentation, implementing code and training models, reporting to management, etc.
 My boss understands that research takes a long time. Nevertheless, I feel like management does not fully grasp that results on this are not certain or even likely.
 Even though the work environment is good, I am not handling the uncertainty around results well mentally.
 I wanted to ask, in your experience, what is a typical team size for this kind of job? And do you have any advice?
 Thanks

                    <span>I am currently working on building a machine learning model, which will be used to automatically label tweets with regards to some prespecified labels (a total of four).
 Together with a team we are looking for an online tool which we could use to outsource preliminary labeling for later training of the model. So far we have been using a program built specifically for this task by one of the co-researchers, but now we want to switch to something more mainstream.
 The task we want to outsource goes as follows: participants will be given the text of the tweet and they will have to label it according to prespecified labels. Simple as that.
 Since the tweets are in Polish we are not interested in any additional features, which would be specific to the English population.
 We are currently considering the two following platforms:
 https://prodi.gy/demo
 https://universaldatatool.com/app/
 Did any of you take part in a similar study and/or have some other experience with using the above tools?
 Are there any other tools that could work for the task above that you could recommend?

                    <span>As the title says, I am curious to learn more about what this sub’s experience has been working with/as management. 
 As context, the company I work for (series b startup) is asking me to take over as the machine learning team manager. While I’m flattered that they see me as a “rising star”, I am a bit concerned about moving away from the actual building, testing, and deployment of machine learning models. I have been an ML engineer for about a year and prior to that I worked as a DS at large tech firm for 2 years and have managed multiple teams prior to that as well. My questions for the sub are as follows:
  
Does moving into a management role take me out of contention for more IC roles in the broader job market? Or do recruiters not care as much about that?
  
I recognize that I will be doing less code development as manager, but just how much of a drop off should I expect?
 ML Managers of Reddit, how do you keep pace with the technical developments in the field without actually writing and submitting code?
 
  
Thanks to everyone in advance!

                    <span>Hello Community!
 We needed a user-friendly image dataset creation tool for Machine Learning and Computer Vision purposes, but since all we could find were advanced simulators, we decided to create an open source one in case anybody else found it useful.
 EasySynth is an easy-to-use UnrealEngine plugin which enables simple generation of ground truth depth images, normal images, optical flow images and semantic images.
 EasySynth does not require knowledge of either C++ or Blueprints. It utilizes a LevelSequence (checkout the video using the link below) to define the movement of the camera and provides a simple interface for semantic labeling of actors present in the scene. It supports exporting camera positions and rotations at each frame, as well as the following output formats:
  
Color images rendered by default
 Depth grayscale images
 Pixel normal images
 Optical flow between frames
 Images with actor semantic labels
  
As an example, the following output can be created in 20 minutes, from the project setup to the output rendering (using a third-party level). Check out the workflow timelapse.
 Provides GT data for training depth estimation, normal estimation, semantic or optical flow models
 For more details check out the GitHub repo. We are working on making this plugin available for free in the Unreal Engine plugin marketplace. The current version works with UE 4.27.
 We hope somebody will find it useful!

 I want to gain research experience in Deep Learning (preferably NLP). 
 How should I go about doing self-research? Working as an RA is one way but most of the professors I&#x27;ve contacted are either not accepting people outside their universities or want to me do full-time which I cannot. 
 I want to build my research profile which will be a valuable asset my grad school application also. 
 Please help me figuring out ways to do research and build top notch projects.

                    <span>Audio data augmentation is a great solution to make your audio AI models more robust. 
 In my new video in the &quot;Audio Data Augmentation&quot; series, you can learn about augmentation techniques both in the raw audio and spectrogram domains.
 Specifically, you’ll learn about:
 📌 Time shifting
 📌 Time stretching
 📌 Pitch scaling
 📌 Noise addition
 📌 Impulse response addition
 📌 Filters
 📌 Polarity Inversion
 📌 Random gain
 📌 Time masking 
 📌 Frequency masking

                    <span>I’m doing my PhD and tempted to publish my latest work there due to the faster review process when compared to other journals. My supervisor is encouraging me to publish there and get started on the next piece of work as soon as possible. He likes to get his PhD students finished quickly via article based phds and says that Access counts as much as any of the other mainstream journals (towards achieving the goal of article based phd). 
 I want to get involved in industry research as soon as possible once graduating and am wondering if publishing in access will diminish my prospects vs publishing in the likes of NN or something like that.

                    <span>Hi all,
 I am studying the most popular DRL algorithms (NFQ, DQN, DDQN, Dueling DDQN, Reinforce, VPG, A3C, A2C, DDPG, TD3, SAC, PPO) and I was wondering a couple of things.
 A) What is the level of detail that you need to remember in order to use those algs efficiently? In other words, do you need to remember every bit of them?
 B) Do you have tricks and tips to remember them more easily, maybe by pointing me at some maps that highlight connections between them 
 Thanks!

                    <span>For a school project I need to create an agent that learns how to navigate a environment using reinforcement learning (DQN, policy gradient). To do this I need to be able to create a neural network which I will need to train. 
 My question now is if there are any Neural Network libraries that I can use for creating and training neural networks. I know unity has the ML-agents toolkit but this does not seem to fit my need. 
 Thanks!

                    <span>Hello, I have some questions about the POMDP environment. 
 First, I thought that in a POMDP environment, a policy-based method would be better than a value-based method. For example, Alice Grid World. Is it generally correct?
 Second, when training a limited view agent in a tabular environment, I expected the rppo agent to perform better than cnn-based ppo. But it didn&#x27;t. I used this repository that was already implemented and saw slow learning based on this. 
 When I trained a Starcraft II agent, there are really huge differences between those architecture. So I just wonder your opinions. Very Thanks!

                    <span>Hi everyone I just started reading &#x27;Reinforcement Learning&#x27; by Richard S. Sutton and Andrew G. Barto and I hit a point where I&#x27;m not really sure why they describe it this way. (And it&#x27;s not just this book, I see this expression everywhere)
 In chapter 3.6 they compute the optimal state value function by the following equation.
 Bellman optimality equation for state value
 It says afterwards how to choose the best policy with the optimal state value function
  
If you have the optimal value function, v* then the actions that appear best after a one-step search will be optimal actions. Another way of saying this is that any policy that is greedy with respect to the optimal evaluation function v\* is an optimal policy.
  
In chapter 4.2 where they describe policy improvement, they give us the following equation for updating the policy based on v_pi.
 Policy update based on v_pi
  
The greedy policy takes the action that looks best in the short term—after one step of lookahead—according to v_pi ... The process of making a new policy that improves on an original policy, by making it greedy with respect to the value function of the original policy, is called policy improvement.
  
To me, when you say &quot;policy that is greedy with respect to v&quot;, it sounds like you just simply choose the action that moves the agent to the next state with the highest state value. But this cannot be true because you have to choose the action that maximizes the following function of v, not simply v itself.
 Function of v you wanna maximize
 And the equation above is q_pi(s, a). So shouldn&#x27;t the correct phrase be &quot;greedy with respect to q&quot; and not v?
 I am wondering if I&#x27;m just overthinking things at this point...

                    <span>As self-driving systems become better, simulating scenarios where the
autonomy stack may fail becomes more important. Traditionally, those scenarios
are generated for a few scenes with respect to the planning module that takes
ground-truth actor states as input. This does not scale and cannot identify all
possible autonomy failures, such as perception failures due to occlusion. In
this paper, we propose AdvSim, an adversarial framework to generate
safety-critical scenarios for any LiDAR-based autonomy system. Given an initial
traffic scenario, AdvSim modifies the actors&#x27; trajectories in a physically
plausible manner and updates the LiDAR sensor data to match the perturbed
world. Importantly, by simulating directly from sensor data, we obtain
adversarial scenarios that are safety-critical for the full autonomy stack. Our
experiments show that our approach is general and can identify thousands of
semantically meaningful safety-critical scenarios for a wide range of modern
self-driving systems. Furthermore, we show that the robustness and safety of
these systems can be further improved by training them with scenarios generated
by AdvSim.</span>

                    <span>We investigate the issues of achieving sufficient rigor in the arguments for
the safety of machine learning functions. By considering the known weaknesses
of DNN-based 2D bounding box detection algorithms, we sharpen the metric of
imprecise pedestrian localization by associating it with the safety goal. The
sharpening leads to introducing a conservative post-processor after the
standard non-max-suppression as a counter-measure. We then propose a
semi-formal assurance case for arguing the effectiveness of the post-processor,
which is further translated into formal proof obligations for demonstrating the
soundness of the arguments. Applying theorem proving not only discovers the
need to introduce missing claims and mathematical concepts but also reveals the
limitation of Dempster-Shafer&#x27;s rules used in semi-formal argumentation.</span>

                    <span>Heterogeneous graph neural networks can represent information of
heterogeneous graphs with excellent ability. Recently, self-supervised learning
manner is researched which learns the unique expression of a graph through a
contrastive learning method. In the absence of labels, this learning methods
show great potential. However, contrastive learning relies heavily on positive
and negative pairs, and generating high-quality pairs from heterogeneous graphs
is difficult. In this paper, in line with recent innovations in self-supervised
learning, we introduce a that can generate good representations without
generating large number of pairs. In addition, paying attention to the fact
that heterogeneous graphs can be viewed from two perspectives in this process,
high-level expressions in the graphs are captured and expressed. The proposed
model showed state-of-the-art performance than other methods in various real
world datasets.</span>

                    <span>Due to their increasing spread, confidence in neural network predictions
became more and more important. However, basic neural networks do not deliver
certainty estimates or suffer from over or under confidence. Many researchers
have been working on understanding and quantifying uncertainty in a neural
network&#x27;s prediction. As a result, different types and sources of uncertainty
have been identified and a variety of approaches to measure and quantify
uncertainty in neural networks have been proposed. This work gives a
comprehensive overview of uncertainty estimation in neural networks, reviews
recent advances in the field, highlights current challenges, and identifies
potential research opportunities. It is intended to give anyone interested in
uncertainty estimation in neural networks a broad overview and introduction,
without presupposing prior knowledge in this field. A comprehensive
introduction to the most crucial sources of uncertainty is given and their
separation into reducible model uncertainty and not reducible data uncertainty
is presented. The modeling of these uncertainties based on deterministic neural
networks, Bayesian neural networks, ensemble of neural networks, and test-time
data augmentation approaches is introduced and different branches of these
fields as well as the latest developments are discussed. For a practical
application, we discuss different measures of uncertainty, approaches for the
calibration of neural networks and give an overview of existing baselines and
implementations. Different examples from the wide spectrum of challenges in
different fields give an idea of the needs and challenges regarding
uncertainties in practical applications. Additionally, the practical
limitations of current methods for mission- and safety-critical real world
applications are discussed and an outlook on the next steps towards a broader
usage of such methods is given.</span>

                    <span>A Bayesian network is a graphical model that encodes probabilistic
relationships among variables of interest. When used in conjunction with
statistical techniques, the graphical model has several advantages for data
analysis. One, because the model encodes dependencies among all variables, it
readily handles situations where some data entries are missing. Two, a Bayesian
network can be used to learn causal relationships, and hence can be used to
gain understanding about a problem domain and to predict the consequences of
intervention. Three, because the model has both a causal and probabilistic
semantics, it is an ideal representation for combining prior knowledge (which
often comes in causal form) and data. Four, Bayesian statistical methods in
conjunction with Bayesian networks offer an efficient and principled approach
for avoiding the overfitting of data. In this paper, we discuss methods for
constructing Bayesian networks from prior knowledge and summarize Bayesian
statistical methods for using data to improve these models. With regard to the
latter task, we describe methods for learning both the parameters and structure
of a Bayesian network, including techniques for learning with incomplete data.
In addition, we relate Bayesian-network methods for learning to techniques for
supervised and unsupervised learning. We illustrate the graphical-modeling
approach using a real-world case study.</span>

                    <span>In this paper we present AIDA, which is an active inference-based agent that
iteratively designs a personalized audio processing algorithm through situated
interactions with a human client. The target application of AIDA is to propose
on-the-spot the most interesting alternative values for the tuning parameters
of a hearing aid (HA) algorithm, whenever a HA client is not satisfied with
their HA performance. AIDA interprets searching for the &quot;most interesting
alternative&quot; as an issue of optimal (acoustic) context-aware Bayesian trial
design. In computational terms, AIDA is realized as an active inference-based
agent with an Expected Free Energy criterion for trial design. This type of
architecture is inspired by neuro-economic models on efficient (Bayesian) trial
design in brains and implies that AIDA comprises generative probabilistic
models for acoustic signals and user responses. We propose a novel generative
model for acoustic signals as a sum of time-varying auto-regressive filters and
a user response model based on a Gaussian Process Classifier. The full AIDA
agent has been implemented in a factor graph for the generative model and all
tasks (parameter learning, acoustic context classification, trial design, etc.)
are realized by variational message passing on the factor graph. All
verification and validation experiments and demonstrations are freely
accessible at our GitHub repository.</span>

                    <span>Self-Driven Particles (SDP) describe a category of multi-agent systems common
in everyday life, such as flocking birds and traffic flows. In a SDP system,
each agent pursues its own goal and constantly changes its cooperative or
competitive behaviors with its nearby agents. Manually designing the
controllers for such SDP system is time-consuming, while the resulting emergent
behaviors are often not realistic nor generalizable. Thus the realistic
simulation of SDP systems remains challenging. Reinforcement learning provides
an appealing alternative for automating the development of the controller for
SDP. However, previous multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) methods define
the agents to be teammates or enemies before hand, which fail to capture the
essence of SDP where the role of each agent varies to be cooperative or
competitive even within one episode. To simulate SDP with MARL, a key challenge
is to coordinate agents&#x27; behaviors while still maximizing individual
objectives. Taking traffic simulation as the testing bed, in this work we
develop a novel MARL method called Coordinated Policy Optimization (CoPO),
which incorporates social psychology principle to learn neural controller for
SDP. Experiments show that the proposed method can achieve superior performance
compared to MARL baselines in various metrics. Noticeably the trained vehicles
exhibit complex and diverse social behaviors that improve performance and
safety of the population as a whole. Demo video and source code are available
at: https://decisionforce.github.io/CoPO/</span>

                    <span>Federated learning can enable remote workers to collaboratively train a
shared machine learning model while allowing training data to be kept locally.
In the use case of wireless mobile devices, the communication overhead is a
critical bottleneck due to limited power and bandwidth. Prior work has utilized
various data compression tools such as quantization and sparsification to
reduce the overhead. In this paper, we propose a predictive coding based
compression scheme for federated learning. The scheme has shared prediction
functions among all devices and allows each worker to transmit a compressed
residual vector derived from the reference. In each communication round, we
select the predictor and quantizer based on the rate-distortion cost, and
further reduce the redundancy with entropy coding. Extensive simulations reveal
that the communication cost can be reduced up to 99% with even better learning
performance when compared with other baseline methods.</span>

                    <span>With the fast development of modern deep learning techniques, the study of
dynamic systems and neural networks is increasingly benefiting each other in a
lot of different ways. Since uncertainties often arise in real world
observations, SDEs (stochastic differential equations) come to play an
important role. To be more specific, in this paper, we use a collection of SDEs
equipped with neural networks to predict long-term trend of noisy time series
which has big jump properties and high probability distribution shift. Our
contributions are, first, we explored SDEs driven by $\alpha$-stable L\&#x27;evy
motion to model the time series data and solved the problem through neural
network approximation. Second, we theoretically proved the convergence of the
model and obtained the convergence rate. Finally, we illustrated our method by
applying it to stock marketing time series prediction and found the convergence
order of error.</span>

                    <span>Partial differential equations (PDEs) play a crucial role in studying a vast
number of problems in science and engineering. Numerically solving nonlinear
and/or high-dimensional PDEs is often a challenging task. Inspired by the
traditional finite difference and finite elements methods and emerging
advancements in machine learning, we propose a sequence deep learning framework
called Neural-PDE, which allows to automatically learn governing rules of any
time-dependent PDE system from existing data by using a bidirectional LSTM
encoder, and predict the next n time steps data. One critical feature of our
proposed framework is that the Neural-PDE is able to simultaneously learn and
simulate the multiscale variables.We test the Neural-PDE by a range of examples
from one-dimensional PDEs to a high-dimensional and nonlinear complex fluids
model. The results show that the Neural-PDE is capable of learning the initial
conditions, boundary conditions and differential operators without the
knowledge of the specific form of a PDE system.In our experiments the
Neural-PDE can efficiently extract the dynamics within 20 epochs training, and
produces accurate predictions. Furthermore, unlike the traditional machine
learning approaches in learning PDE such as CNN and MLP which require vast
parameters for model precision, Neural-PDE shares parameters across all time
steps, thus considerably reduces the computational complexity and leads to a
fast learning algorithm.</span>

                    <span>In this paper, we propose a semigroup method for solving high-dimensional
elliptic partial differential equations (PDEs) and the associated eigenvalue
problems based on neural networks. For the PDE problems, we reformulate the
original equations as variational problems with the help of semigroup operators
and then solve the variational problems with neural network (NN)
parameterization. The main advantages are that no mixed second-order derivative
computation is needed during the stochastic gradient descent training and that
the boundary conditions are taken into account automatically by the semigroup
operator. Unlike popular methods like PINN \cite{raissi2019physics} and Deep
Ritz \cite{weinan2018deep} where the Dirichlet boundary condition is enforced
solely through penalty functions and thus changes the true solution, the
proposed method is able to address the boundary conditions without penalty
functions and it gives the correct true solution even when penalty functions
are added, thanks to the semigroup operator. For eigenvalue problems, a
primal-dual method is proposed, efficiently resolving the constraint with a
simple scalar dual variable and resulting in a faster algorithm compared with
the BSDE solver \cite{han2020solving} in certain problems such as the
eigenvalue problem associated with the linear Schr\&quot;odinger operator. Numerical
results are provided to demonstrate the performance of the proposed methods.</span>

                    <span>We develop and analyze MARINA: a new communication efficient method for
non-convex distributed learning over heterogeneous datasets. MARINA employs a
novel communication compression strategy based on the compression of gradient
differences that is reminiscent of but different from the strategy employed in
the DIANA method of Mishchenko et al. (2019). Unlike virtually all competing
distributed first-order methods, including DIANA, ours is based on a carefully
designed biased gradient estimator, which is the key to its superior
theoretical and practical performance. The communication complexity bounds we
prove for MARINA are evidently better than those of all previous first-order
methods. Further, we develop and analyze two variants of MARINA: VR-MARINA and
PP-MARINA. The first method is designed for the case when the local loss
functions owned by clients are either of a finite sum or of an expectation
form, and the second method allows for a partial participation of clients -- a
feature important in federated learning. All our methods are superior to
previous state-of-the-art methods in terms of oracle/communication complexity.
Finally, we provide a convergence analysis of all methods for problems
satisfying the Polyak-Lojasiewicz condition.</span>

                    <span>Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is an important non-invasive clinical tool
that can produce high-resolution and reproducible images. However, a long
scanning time is required for high-quality MR images, which leads to exhaustion
and discomfort of patients, inducing more artefacts due to voluntary movements
of the patients and involuntary physiological movements. To accelerate the
scanning process, methods by k-space undersampling and deep learning based
reconstruction have been popularised. This work introduced SwinMR, a novel Swin
transformer based method for fast MRI reconstruction. The whole network
consisted of an input module (IM), a feature extraction module (FEM) and an
output module (OM). The IM and OM were 2D convolutional layers and the FEM was
composed of a cascaded of residual Swin transformer blocks (RSTBs) and 2D
convolutional layers. The RSTB consisted of a series of Swin transformer layers
(STLs). The shifted windows multi-head self-attention (W-MSA/SW-MSA) of STL was
performed in shifted windows rather than the multi-head self-attention (MSA) of
the original transformer in the whole image space. A novel multi-channel loss
was proposed by using the sensitivity maps, which was proved to reserve more
textures and details. We performed a series of comparative studies and ablation
studies in the Calgary-Campinas public brain MR dataset and conducted a
downstream segmentation experiment in the Multi-modal Brain Tumour Segmentation
Challenge 2017 dataset. The results demonstrate our SwinMR achieved
high-quality reconstruction compared with other benchmark methods, and it shows
great robustness with different undersampling masks, under noise interruption
and on different datasets. The code is publicly available at
https://github.com/ayanglab/SwinMR.</span>

                    <span>With the proliferation of IoT devices, researchers have developed a variety
of IoT device identification methods with the assistance of machine learning.
Nevertheless, the security of these identification methods mostly depends on
collected training data. In this research, we propose a novel attack strategy
named IoTGAN to manipulate an IoT device&#x27;s traffic such that it can evade
machine learning based IoT device identification. In the development of IoTGAN,
we have two major technical challenges: (i) How to obtain the discriminative
model in a black-box setting, and (ii) How to add perturbations to IoT traffic
through the manipulative model, so as to evade the identification while not
influencing the functionality of IoT devices. To address these challenges, a
neural network based substitute model is used to fit the target model in
black-box settings, it works as a discriminative model in IoTGAN. A
manipulative model is trained to add adversarial perturbations into the IoT
device&#x27;s traffic to evade the substitute model. Experimental results show that
IoTGAN can successfully achieve the attack goals. We also develop efficient
countermeasures to protect machine learning based IoT device identification
from been undermined by IoTGAN.</span>

                    <span>Health literacy has emerged as a crucial factor in making appropriate health
decisions and ensuring treatment outcomes. However, medical jargon and the
complex structure of professional language in this domain make health
information especially hard to interpret. Thus, there is an urgent unmet need
for automated methods to enhance the accessibility of the biomedical literature
to the general population. This problem can be framed as a type of translation
problem between the language of healthcare professionals, and that of the
general public. In this paper, we introduce the novel task of automated
generation of lay language summaries of biomedical scientific reviews, and
construct a dataset to support the development and evaluation of automated
methods through which to enhance the accessibility of the biomedical
literature. We conduct analyses of the various challenges in solving this task,
including not only summarization of the key points but also explanation of
background knowledge and simplification of professional language. We experiment
with state-of-the-art summarization models as well as several data augmentation
techniques, and evaluate their performance using both automated metrics and
human assessment. Results indicate that automatically generated summaries
produced using contemporary neural architectures can achieve promising quality
and readability as compared with reference summaries developed for the lay
public by experts (best ROUGE-L of 50.24 and Flesch-Kincaid readability score
of 13.30). We also discuss the limitations of the current attempt, providing
insights and directions for future work.</span>

                    <span>Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) experiments are commonly performed in
simulated environments due to the tremendous training sample demands from deep
neural networks. In contrast, model-based Bayesian Learning allows a robot to
learn good policies within a few trials in the real world. Although it takes
fewer iterations, Bayesian methods pay a relatively higher computational cost
per trial, and the advantage of such methods is strongly tied to dimensionality
and noise. In here, we compare a Deep Bayesian Learning algorithm with a
model-free DRL algorithm while analyzing our results collected from both
simulations and real-world experiments. While considering Sim and Real
learning, our experiments show that the sample-efficient Deep Bayesian RL
performance is better than DRL even when computation time (as opposed to number
of iterations) is taken in consideration. Additionally, the difference in
computation time between Deep Bayesian RL performed in simulation and in
experiments point to a viable path to traverse the reality gap. We also show
that a mix between Sim and Real does not outperform a purely Real approach,
pointing to the possibility that reality can provide the best prior knowledge
to a Bayesian Learning. Roboticists design and build robots every day, and our
results show that a higher learning efficiency in the real-world will shorten
the time between design and deployment by skipping simulations.</span>

                    <span>Scoring systems, as a type of predictive model, have significant advantages
in interpretability and transparency and facilitate quick decision-making. As
such, scoring systems have been extensively used in a wide variety of
industries such as healthcare and criminal justice. However, the fairness
issues in these models have long been criticized, and the use of big data and
machine learning algorithms in the construction of scoring systems heightens
this concern. In this paper, we propose a general framework to create
fairness-aware, data-driven scoring systems. First, we develop a social welfare
function that incorporates both efficiency and group fairness. Then, we
transform the social welfare maximization problem into the risk minimization
task in machine learning, and derive a fairness-aware scoring system with the
help of mixed integer programming. Lastly, several theoretical bounds are
derived for providing parameter selection suggestions. Our proposed framework
provides a suitable solution to address group fairness concerns in the
development of scoring systems. It enables policymakers to set and customize
their desired fairness requirements as well as other application-specific
constraints. We test the proposed algorithm with several empirical data sets.
Experimental evidence supports the effectiveness of the proposed scoring system
in achieving the optimal welfare of stakeholders and in balancing the needs for
interpretability, fairness, and efficiency.</span>

systems (NIDS) uses well-established datasets such as KDD-CUP99, NSL-KDD,
UNSW-NB15, and CICIDS-2017. In this context, the possibilities of machine
learning techniques are explored, aiming for metrics improvements compared to
the published baselines (model-centric approach). However, those datasets
present some limitations as aging that make it unfeasible to transpose those
ML-based solutions to real-world applications. This paper presents a systematic
data-centric approach to address the current limitations of NIDS research,
specifically the datasets. This approach generates NIDS datasets composed of
the most recent network traffic and attacks, with the labeling process
integrated by design.</span>

                    <span>Pawlak rough set and neighborhood rough set are the two most common rough set
theoretical models. Pawlawk can use equivalence classes to represent knowledge,
but it cannot process continuous data; neighborhood rough sets can process
continuous data, but it loses the ability of using equivalence classes to
represent knowledge. To this end, this paper presents a granular-ball rough set
based on the granlar-ball computing. The granular-ball rough set can
simultaneously represent Pawlak rough sets, and the neighborhood rough set, so
as to realize the unified representation of the two. This makes the
granular-ball rough set not only can deal with continuous data, but also can
use equivalence classes for knowledge representation. In addition, we propose
an implementation algorithms of granular-ball rough sets. The experimental
resuts on benchmark datasets demonstrate that, due to the combination of the
robustness and adaptability of the granular-ball computing, the learning
accuracy of the granular-ball rough set has been greatly improved compared with
the Pawlak rough set and the traditional neighborhood rough set. The
granular-ball rough set also outperforms nine popular or the state-of-the-art
feature selection methods.</span>

                    <span>Differentiable physics is a powerful tool in computer vision and robotics for
scene understanding and reasoning about interactions. Existing approaches have
frequently been limited to objects with simple shape or shapes that are known
in advance. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to differentiable
physics with frictional contacts which represents object shapes implicitly
using signed distance fields (SDFs). Our simulation supports contact point
calculation even when the involved shapes are nonconvex. Moreover, we propose
ways for differentiating the dynamics for the object shape to facilitate shape
optimization using gradient-based methods. In our experiments, we demonstrate
that our approach allows for model-based inference of physical parameters such
as friction coefficients, mass, forces or shape parameters from trajectory and
depth image observations in several challenging synthetic scenarios and a real
image sequence.</span>

                    <span>The input of almost every machine learning algorithm targeting the properties
of matter at the atomic scale involves a transformation of the list of
Cartesian atomic coordinates into a more symmetric representation. Many of the
most popular representations can be seen as an expansion of the symmetrized
correlations of the atom density, and differ mainly by the choice of basis.
Considerable effort has been dedicated to the optimization of the basis set,
typically driven by heuristic considerations on the behavior of the regression
target. Here we take a different, unsupervised viewpoint, aiming to determine
the basis that encodes in the most compact way possible the structural
information that is relevant for the dataset at hand. For each training dataset
and number of basis functions, one can determine a unique basis that is optimal
in this sense, and can be computed at no additional cost with respect to the
primitive basis by approximating it with splines. We demonstrate that this
construction yields representations that are accurate and computationally
efficient, particularly when constructing representations that correspond to
high-body order correlations. We present examples that involve both molecular
and condensed-phase machine-learning models.</span>

                    <span>This paper presents a way of doing large scale audio understanding without
traditional state of the art neural architectures. Ever since the introduction
of deep learning for understanding audio signals in the past decade,
convolutional architectures have been able to achieve state of the art results
surpassing traditional hand-crafted features. In the recent past, there has
been a similar shift away from traditional convolutional and recurrent neural
networks towards purely end-to-end Transformer architectures. We, in this work,
explore an approach, based on Bag-of-Words model. Our approach does not have
any convolutions, recurrence, attention, transformers or other approaches such
as BERT. We utilize micro and macro level clustered vanilla embeddings, and use
a MLP head for classification. We only use feed-forward encoder-decoder models
to get the bottlenecks of spectral envelops, spectral patches and slices as
well as multi-resolution spectra. A classification head (a feed-forward layer),
similar to the approach in SimCLR is trained on a learned representation. Using
simple codes learned on latent representations, we show how we surpass
traditional convolutional neural network architectures, and come strikingly
close to outperforming powerful Transformer architectures. This work hopefully
would pave way for exciting advancements in the field of representation
learning without massive, end-to-end neural architectures.</span>

                    <span>The ability to decompose scenes into their object components is a desired
property for autonomous agents, allowing them to reason and act in their
surroundings. Recently, different methods have been proposed to learn
object-centric representations from data in an unsupervised manner. These
methods often rely on latent representations learned by deep neural networks,
hence requiring high computational costs and large amounts of curated data.
Such models are also difficult to interpret. To address these challenges, we
propose the Phase-Correlation Decomposition Network (PCDNet), a novel model
that decomposes a scene into its object components, which are represented as
transformed versions of a set of learned object prototypes. The core building
block in PCDNet is the Phase-Correlation Cell (PC Cell), which exploits the
frequency-domain representation of the images in order to estimate the
transformation between an object prototype and its transformed version in the
image. In our experiments, we show how PCDNet outperforms state-of-the-art
methods for unsupervised object discovery and segmentation on simple benchmark
datasets and on more challenging data, while using a small number of learnable
parameters and being fully interpretable.</span>

                    <span>Continual learning tackles the setting of learning different tasks
sequentially. Despite the lots of previous solutions, most of them still suffer
significant forgetting or expensive memory cost. In this work, targeted at
these problems, we first study the continual learning process through the lens
of information theory and observe that forgetting of a model stems from the
loss of \emph{information gain} on its parameters from the previous tasks when
learning a new task. From this viewpoint, we then propose a novel continual
learning approach called Bit-Level Information Preserving (BLIP) that preserves
the information gain on model parameters through updating the parameters at the
bit level, which can be conveniently implemented with parameter quantization.
More specifically, BLIP first trains a neural network with weight quantization
on the new incoming task and then estimates information gain on each parameter
provided by the task data to determine the bits to be frozen to prevent
forgetting. We conduct extensive experiments ranging from classification tasks
to reinforcement learning tasks, and the results show that our method produces
better or on par results comparing to previous state-of-the-arts. Indeed, BLIP
achieves close to zero forgetting while only requiring constant memory
overheads throughout continual learning.</span>

idiosyncrasies of the UCI Adult dataset that limit its external validity. Our
primary contribution is a suite of new datasets derived from US Census surveys

We create prediction tasks relating to income, employment, health,

propose Grounded Relational Inference (GRI). It models an interactive system&#x27;s
underlying dynamics by inferring an interaction graph representing the agents&#x27;
relations. We ensure a semantically meaningful interaction graph by grounding
the relational latent space into semantic interactive behaviors defined with

                    <span>Fast assimilation of monitoring data to update forecasts of pressure buildup
and carbon dioxide (CO2) plume migration under geologic uncertainties is a
challenging problem in geologic carbon storage. The high computational cost of
data assimilation with a high-dimensional parameter space impedes fast
decision-making for commercial-scale reservoir management. We propose to
leverage physical understandings of porous medium flow behavior with deep
learning techniques to develop a fast history matching-reservoir response
forecasting workflow. Applying an Ensemble Smoother Multiple Data Assimilation
framework, the workflow updates geologic properties and predicts reservoir
performance with quantified uncertainty from pressure history and CO2 plumes
interpreted through seismic inversion. As the most computationally expensive
component in such a workflow is reservoir simulation, we developed surrogate
models to predict dynamic pressure and CO2 plume extents under multi-well
injection. The surrogate models employ deep convolutional neural networks,
specifically, a wide residual network and a residual U-Net. The workflow is
validated against a flat three-dimensional reservoir model representative of a
clastic shelf depositional environment. Intelligent treatments are applied to
bridge between quantities in a true-3D reservoir model and those in a
single-layer reservoir model. The workflow can complete history matching and
reservoir forecasting with uncertainty quantification in less than one hour on

                    <span>3D ultrasound (3DUS) becomes more interesting for target tracking in
radiation therapy due to its capability to provide volumetric images in
real-time without using ionizing radiation. It is potentially usable for
tracking without using fiducials. For this, a method for learning meaningful
representations would be useful to recognize anatomical structures in different
time frames in representation space (r-space). In this study, 3DUS patches are
reduced into a 128-dimensional r-space using conventional autoencoder,
variational autoencoder and sliced-wasserstein autoencoder. In the r-space, the
capability of separating different ultrasound patches as well as recognizing
similar patches is investigated and compared based on a dataset of liver
images. Two metrics to evaluate the tracking capability in the r-space are
proposed. It is shown that ultrasound patches with different anatomical
structures can be distinguished and sets of similar patches can be clustered in
r-space. The results indicate that the investigated autoencoders have different
levels of usability for target tracking in 3DUS.</span>

used to perform adaptively-chosen analyses, while ensuring that the
differential privacy loss of each participant does not exceed a pre-specified
privacy budget. The standard approach to this problem relies on bounding a
worst-case estimate of the privacy loss over all individuals and all possible
values of their data, for every single analysis. Yet, in many scenarios this
approach is overly conservative, especially for &quot;typical&quot; data points which
incur little privacy loss by participation in most of the analyses. In this
work, we give a method for tighter privacy loss accounting based on the value
of a personalized privacy loss estimate for each individual in each analysis.
To implement the accounting method we design a filter for R\&#x27;enyi differential
privacy. A filter is a tool that ensures that the privacy parameter of a
composed sequence of algorithms with adaptively-chosen privacy parameters does
not exceed a pre-specified budget. Our filter is simpler and tighter than the
known filter for $(\epsilon,\delta)$-differential privacy by Rogers et al. We
apply our results to the analysis of noisy gradient descent and show that
personalized accounting can be practical, easy to implement, and can only make
the privacy-utility tradeoff tighter.</span>

expected behavior or cooperation to operate appropriately. Instead, such
systems should be aware of malicious procedures for unauthorized access
attempts. Some works available in the literature suggest addressing the problem
through gait recognition approaches. Such methods aim at identifying human
beings through intrinsic perceptible features, despite dressed clothes or

                    <span>In information retrieval (IR) systems, trends and users&#x27; interests may change
over time, altering either the distribution of requests or contents to be
recommended. Since neural ranking approaches heavily depend on the training
data, it is crucial to understand the transfer capacity of recent IR approaches
to address new domains in the long term. In this paper, we first propose a
dataset based upon the MSMarco corpus aiming at modeling a long stream of
topics as well as IR property-driven controlled settings. We then in-depth
analyze the ability of recent neural IR models while continually learning those
streams. Our empirical study highlights in which particular cases catastrophic
forgetting occurs (e.g., level of similarity between tasks, peculiarities on
text length, and ways of learning models) to provide future directions in terms
of model design.</span>

                    <span>Adaptive gradient methods have shown excellent performances for solving many
machine learning problems. Although multiple adaptive gradient methods were
recently studied, they mainly focus on either empirical or theoretical aspects
and also only work for specific problems by using some specific adaptive
learning rates. Thus, it is desired to design a universal framework for
practical algorithms of adaptive gradients with theoretical guarantee to solve
general problems. To fill this gap, we propose a faster and universal framework
of adaptive gradients (i.e., SUPER-ADAM) by introducing a universal adaptive
matrix that includes most existing adaptive gradient forms. Moreover, our
framework can flexibly integrate the momentum and variance reduced techniques.
In particular, our novel framework provides the convergence analysis support
for adaptive gradient methods under the nonconvex setting. In theoretical
analysis, we prove that our SUPER-ADAM algorithm can achieve the best known
gradient (i.e., stochastic first-order oracle (SFO)) complexity of
$\tilde{O}(\epsilon^{-3})$ for finding an $\epsilon$-stationary point of
nonconvex optimization, which matches the lower bound for stochastic smooth
nonconvex optimization. In numerical experiments, we employ various deep
learning tasks to validate that our algorithm consistently outperforms the
existing adaptive algorithms. Code is available at

                    <span>Factorization machine (FM) is a prevalent approach to modeling pairwise
(second-order) feature interactions when dealing with high-dimensional sparse
data. However, on the one hand, FM fails to capture higher-order feature
interactions suffering from combinatorial expansion, on the other hand, taking
into account interaction between every pair of features may introduce noise and
degrade prediction accuracy. To solve the problems, we propose a novel approach
Graph Factorization Machine (GraphFM) by naturally representing features in the
graph structure. In particular, a novel mechanism is designed to select the
beneficial feature interactions and formulate them as edges between features.
Then our proposed model which integrates the interaction function of FM into
the feature aggregation strategy of Graph Neural Network (GNN), can model
arbitrary-order feature interactions on the graph-structured features by
stacking layers. Experimental results on several real-world datasets has
demonstrated the rationality and effectiveness of our proposed approach.</span>

                    <span>Deep Q Network (DQN) firstly kicked the door of deep reinforcement learning
(DRL) via combining deep learning (DL) with reinforcement learning (RL), which
has noticed that the distribution of the acquired data would change during the
training process. DQN found this property might cause instability for training,
so it proposed effective methods to handle the downside of the property.
Instead of focusing on the unfavourable aspects, we find it critical for RL to
ease the gap between the estimated data distribution and the ground truth data
distribution while supervised learning (SL) fails to do so. From this new
perspective, we extend the basic paradigm of RL called the Generalized Policy
Iteration (GPI) into a more generalized version, which is called the
Generalized Data Distribution Iteration (GDI). We see massive RL algorithms and
techniques can be unified into the GDI paradigm, which can be considered as one
of the special cases of GDI. We provide theoretical proof of why GDI is better
than GPI and how it works. Several practical algorithms based on GDI have been
proposed to verify the effectiveness and extensiveness of it. Empirical
experiments prove our state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on Arcade Learning
Environment (ALE), wherein our algorithm has achieved 9620.98% mean human
normalized score (HNS), 1146.39% median HNS and 22 human world record
breakthroughs (HWRB) using only 200M training frames. Our work aims to lead the
RL research to step into the journey of conquering the human world records and
seek real superhuman agents on both performance and efficiency.</span>

                    <span>Hottopixx, proposed by Bittorf et al. at NIPS 2012, is an algorithm for
solving nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) problems under the separability
assumption. Separable NMFs have important applications, such as topic
extraction from documents and unmixing of hyperspectral images. In such
applications, the robustness of the algorithm to noise is the key to the
success. Hottopixx has been shown to be robust to noise, and its robustness can
be further enhanced through postprocessing. However, there is a drawback.
Hottopixx and its postprocessing require us to estimate the noise level
involved in the matrix we want to factorize before running, since they use it
as part of the input data. The noise-level estimation is not an easy task. In
this paper, we overcome this drawback. We present a refinement of Hottopixx and
its postprocessing that runs without prior knowledge of the noise level. We
show that the refinement has almost the same robustness to noise as the
original algorithm.</span>

                    <span>This paper deals with a network of computing agents aiming to solve an online
optimization problem in a distributed fashion, i.e., by means of local
computation and communication, without any central coordinator. We propose the
gradient tracking with adaptive momentum estimation (GTAdam) distributed
algorithm, which combines a gradient tracking mechanism with first and second
order momentum estimates of the gradient. The algorithm is analyzed in the
online setting for strongly convex cost functions with Lipschitz continuous
gradients. We provide an upper bound for the dynamic regret given by a term
related to the initial conditions, and another term related to the temporal
variations of the objective functions. Moreover, a linear convergence rate is
guaranteed in the static set-up. The algorithm is tested on a time-varying
classification problem, on a (moving) target localization problem and in a
stochastic optimization setup from image classification. In these numerical
experiments from multi-agent learning, GTAdam outperforms state-of-the-art
distributed optimization methods.</span>

                    <span>Power allocation is one of the fundamental problems in wireless networks and
a wide variety of algorithms address this problem from different perspectives.
A common element among these algorithms is that they rely on an estimation of
the channel state, which may be inaccurate on account of hardware defects,
noisy feedback systems, and environmental and adversarial disturbances.
Therefore, it is essential that the output power allocation of these algorithms
is stable with respect to input perturbations, to the extent that the
variations in the output are bounded for bounded variations in the input. In
this paper, we focus on UWMMSE -- a modern algorithm leveraging graph neural
networks --, and illustrate its stability to additive input perturbations of
bounded energy through both theoretical analysis and empirical validation.</span>

                    <span>In order to meet the extremely heterogeneous requirements of the next
generation wireless communication networks, research community is increasingly
dependent on using machine learning solutions for real-time decision-making and
radio resource management. Traditional machine learning employs fully
centralized architecture in which the entire training data is collected at one
node e.g., cloud server, that significantly increases the communication
overheads and also raises severe privacy concerns. Towards this end, a
distributed machine learning paradigm termed as Federated learning (FL) has
been proposed recently. In FL, each participating edge device trains its local
model by using its own training data. Then, via the wireless channels the
weights or parameters of the locally trained models are sent to the central PS,
that aggregates them and updates the global model. On one hand, FL plays an
important role for optimizing the resources of wireless communication networks,
on the other hand, wireless communications is crucial for FL. Thus, a
&#x60;bidirectional&#x27; relationship exists between FL and wireless communications.
Although FL is an emerging concept, many publications have already been
published in the domain of FL and its applications for next generation wireless
networks. Nevertheless, we noticed that none of the works have highlighted the
bidirectional relationship between FL and wireless communications. Therefore,
the purpose of this survey paper is to bridge this gap in literature by
providing a timely and comprehensive discussion on the interdependency between
FL and wireless communications.</span>

                    <span>Energy harvesting (EH) IoT devices that operate intermittently without
batteries, coupled with advances in deep neural networks (DNNs), have opened up
new opportunities for enabling sustainable smart applications. Nevertheless,
implementing those computation and memory-intensive intelligent algorithms on
EH devices is extremely difficult due to the challenges of limited resources
and intermittent power supply that causes frequent failures. To address those
challenges, this paper proposes a methodology that enables fast deep learning
with low-energy accelerators for tiny energy harvesting devices. We first
propose $RAD$, a resource-aware structured DNN training framework, which
employs block circulant matrix and structured pruning to achieve high
compression for leveraging the advantage of various vector operation
accelerators. A DNN implementation method, $ACE$, is then proposed that employs
low-energy accelerators to profit maximum performance with small energy
consumption. Finally, we further design $FLEX$, the system support for
intermittent computation in energy harvesting situations. Experimental results
from three different DNN models demonstrate that $RAD$, $ACE$, and $FLEX$ can
enable fast and correct inference on energy harvesting devices with up to 4.26X
runtime reduction, up to 7.7X energy reduction with higher accuracy over the
state-of-the-art.</span>

                    <span>Due to limited computational cost and energy consumption, most neural network
models deployed in mobile devices are tiny. However, tiny neural networks are
commonly very vulnerable to attacks. Current research has proved that larger
model size can improve robustness, but little research focuses on how to
enhance the robustness of tiny neural networks. Our work focuses on how to
improve the robustness of tiny neural networks without seriously deteriorating
of clean accuracy under mobile-level resources. To this end, we propose a
multi-objective oneshot network architecture search (NAS) algorithm to obtain
the best trade-off networks in terms of the adversarial accuracy, the clean
accuracy and the model size. Specifically, we design a novel search space based
on new tiny blocks and channels to balance model size and adversarial
performance. Moreover, since the supernet significantly affects the performance
of subnets in our NAS algorithm, we reveal the insights into how the supernet
helps to obtain the best subnet under white-box adversarial attacks.
Concretely, we explore a new adversarial training paradigm by analyzing the
adversarial transferability, the width of the supernet and the difference
between training the subnets from scratch and fine-tuning. Finally, we make a
statistical analysis for the layer-wise combination of certain blocks and
channels on the first non-dominated front, which can serve as a guideline to
design tiny neural network architectures for the resilience of adversarial
perturbations.</span>

                    <span>In supervised learning, training and test datasets are often sampled from
distinct distributions. Domain adaptation techniques are thus required.
Covariate shift adaptation yields good generalization performance when domains
differ only by the marginal distribution of features. Covariate shift
adaptation is usually implemented using importance weighting, which may fail,
according to common wisdom, due to small effective sample sizes (ESS). Previous
research argues this scenario is more common in high-dimensional settings.
However, how effective sample size, dimensionality, and model
performance/generalization are formally related in supervised learning,
considering the context of covariate shift adaptation, is still somewhat
obscure in the literature. Thus, a main challenge is presenting a unified
theory connecting those points. Hence, in this paper, we focus on building a
unified view connecting the ESS, data dimensionality, and generalization in the
context of covariate shift adaptation. Moreover, we also demonstrate how
dimensionality reduction or feature selection can increase the ESS, and argue
that our results support dimensionality reduction before covariate shift
adaptation as a good practice.</span>

                    <span>Due to the significant advancement of Natural Language Processing and
Computer Vision-based models, Visual Question Answering (VQA) systems are
becoming more intelligent and advanced. However, they are still error-prone
when dealing with relatively complex questions. Therefore, it is important to
understand the behaviour of the VQA models before adopting their results. In
this paper, we introduce an interpretability approach for VQA models by
generating counterfactual images. Specifically, the generated image is supposed
to have the minimal possible change to the original image and leads the VQA
model to give a different answer. In addition, our approach ensures that the
generated image is realistic. Since quantitative metrics cannot be employed to
evaluate the interpretability of the model, we carried out a user study to
assess different aspects of our approach. In addition to interpreting the
result of VQA models on single images, the obtained results and the discussion
provides an extensive explanation of VQA models&#x27; behaviour.</span>

                    <span>Although ubiquitous in modern vehicles, Controller Area Networks (CANs) lack
basic security properties and are easily exploitable. A rapidly growing field
of CAN security research has emerged that seeks to detect intrusions on CANs.
Producing vehicular CAN data with a variety of intrusions is out of reach for
most researchers as it requires expensive assets and expertise. To assist
researchers, we present the first comprehensive guide to the existing open CAN
intrusion datasets, including a quality analysis of each dataset and an
enumeration of each&#x27;s benefits, drawbacks, and suggested use case. Current
public CAN IDS datasets are limited to real fabrication (simple message
injection) attacks and simulated attacks often in synthetic data, which lack
fidelity. In general, the physical effects of attacks on the vehicle are not
verified in the available datasets. Only one dataset provides signal-translated
data but not a corresponding raw binary version. Overall, the available data
pigeon-holes CAN IDS works into testing on limited, often inappropriate data
(usually with attacks that are too easily detectable to truly test the method),
and this lack data has stymied comparability and reproducibility of results. As
our primary contribution, we present the ROAD (Real ORNL Automotive
Dynamometer) CAN Intrusion Dataset, consisting of over 3.5 hours of one
vehicle&#x27;s CAN data. ROAD contains ambient data recorded during a diverse set of
activities, and attacks of increasing stealth with multiple variants and
instances of real fuzzing, fabrication, and unique advanced attacks, as well as
simulated masquerade attacks. To facilitate benchmarking CAN IDS methods that
require signal-translated inputs, we also provide the signal time series format
for many of the CAN captures. Our contributions aim to facilitate appropriate
benchmarking and needed comparability in the CAN IDS field.</span>

The approach combines signal processing methods with fine-tuned deep learning

                    <span>Classic image-restoration algorithms use a variety of priors, either
implicitly or explicitly. Their priors are hand-designed and their
corresponding weights are heuristically assigned. Hence, deep learning methods
often produce superior image restoration quality. Deep networks are, however,
capable of inducing strong and hardly predictable hallucinations. Networks
implicitly learn to be jointly faithful to the observed data while learning an
image prior; and the separation of original data and hallucinated data
downstream is then not possible. This limits their wide-spread adoption in
image restoration. Furthermore, it is often the hallucinated part that is
victim to degradation-model overfitting.

We present an approach with decoupled network-prior based hallucination and
data fidelity terms. We refer to our framework as the Bayesian Integration of a
Generative Prior (BIGPrior). Our method is rooted in a Bayesian framework and
tightly connected to classic restoration methods. In fact, it can be viewed as
a generalization of a large family of classic restoration algorithms. We use
network inversion to extract image prior information from a generative network.
We show that, on image colorization, inpainting and denoising, our framework
consistently improves the inversion results. Our method, though partly reliant
on the quality of the generative network inversion, is competitive with
state-of-the-art supervised and task-specific restoration methods. It also
provides an additional metric that sets forth the degree of prior reliance per
pixel relative to data fidelity.</span>

                    <span>Deep learning is a group of exciting new technologies for neural networks.
Through a combination of advanced training techniques and neural network
architectural components, it is now possible to create neural networks that can
handle tabular data, images, text, and audio as both input and output. Deep
learning allows a neural network to learn hierarchies of information in a way
that is like the function of the human brain. This course will introduce the
student to classic neural network structures, Convolution Neural Networks
(CNN), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Gated Recurrent Neural Networks (GRU),
General Adversarial Networks (GAN), and reinforcement learning. Application of
these architectures to computer vision, time series, security, natural language
processing (NLP), and data generation will be covered. High-Performance
Computing (HPC) aspects will demonstrate how deep learning can be leveraged
both on graphical processing units (GPUs), as well as grids. Focus is primarily
upon the application of deep learning to problems, with some introduction to
mathematical foundations. Readers will use the Python programming language to
implement deep learning using Google TensorFlow and Keras. It is not necessary
to know Python prior to this book; however, familiarity with at least one
programming language is assumed.</span>

drones. Study in hand proposes an improved and efficient Deep Learning based

                    <span>Modeling the burning processes of biomass such as wood, grass, and crops is
crucial for the modeling and prediction of wildland and urban fire behavior.
Despite its importance, the burning of solid fuels remains poorly understood,
which can be partly attributed to the unknown chemical kinetics of most solid
fuels. Most available kinetic models were built upon expert knowledge, which
requires chemical insights and years of experience. This work presents a
framework for autonomously discovering biomass pyrolysis kinetic models from
thermogravimetric analyzer (TGA) experimental data using the recently developed
chemical reaction neural networks (CRNN). The approach incorporated the CRNN
model into the framework of neural ordinary differential equations to predict
the residual mass in TGA data. In addition to the flexibility of
neural-network-based models, the learned CRNN model is interpretable, by
incorporating the fundamental physics laws, such as the law of mass action and
Arrhenius law, into the neural network structure. The learned CRNN model can
then be translated into the classical forms of biomass chemical kinetic models,
which facilitates the extraction of chemical insights and the integration of
the kinetic model into large-scale fire simulations. We demonstrated the
effectiveness of the framework in predicting the pyrolysis and oxidation of
cellulose. This successful demonstration opens the possibility of rapid and
autonomous chemical kinetic modeling of solid fuels, such as wildfire fuels and
industrial polymers.</span>

                    <span>Deep learning based models have significantly improved the performance of
speech separation with input mixtures like the cocktail party. Prominent
methods (e.g., frequency-domain and time-domain speech separation) usually
build regression models to predict the ground-truth speech from the mixture,
using the masking-based design and the signal-level loss criterion (e.g., MSE
or SI-SNR). This study demonstrates, for the first time, that the
synthesis-based approach can also perform well on this problem, with great
flexibility and strong potential. Specifically, we propose a novel speech
separation/enhancement model based on the recognition of discrete symbols, and
convert the paradigm of the speech separation/enhancement related tasks from
regression to classification. By utilizing the synthesis model with the input
of discrete symbols, after the prediction of discrete symbol sequence, each
target speech could be re-synthesized. Evaluation results based on the
WSJ0-2mix and VCTK-noisy corpora in various settings show that our proposed
method can steadily synthesize the separated speech with high speech quality
and without any interference, which is difficult to avoid in regression-based
methods. In addition, with negligible loss of listening quality, the speaker
conversion of enhanced/separated speech could be easily realized through our
method.</span>

                    <span>With the increased penetration of wind energy into the power grid, it has
become increasingly important to be able to predict the expected power
production for larger wind farms. Deep learning (DL) models can learn complex
patterns in the data and have found wide success in predicting wake losses and
expected power production. This paper proposes a modular framework for
attention-based graph neural networks (GNN), where attention can be applied to
any desired component of a graph block. The results show that the model
significantly outperforms a multilayer perceptron (MLP) and a bidirectional
LSTM (BLSTM) model, while delivering performance on-par with a vanilla GNN
model. Moreover, we argue that the proposed graph attention architecture can
easily adapt to different applications by offering flexibility into the desired
attention operations to be used, which might depend on the specific
application. Through analysis of the attention weights, it was showed that
employing attention-based GNNs can provide insights into what the models learn.
In particular, the attention networks seemed to realise turbine dependencies
that aligned with some physical intuition about wake losses.</span>

                    <span>Large-scale data analysis is growing at an exponential rate as data
proliferates in our societies. This abundance of data has the advantage of
allowing the decision-maker to implement complex models in scenarios that were
prohibitive before. At the same time, such an amount of data requires a
distributed thinking approach. In fact, Deep Learning models require plenty of
resources, and distributed training is needed. This paper presents a
Multicriteria approach for distributed learning. Our approach uses the Weighted
Goal Programming approach in its Chebyshev formulation to build an ensemble of
decision rules that optimize aprioristically defined performance metrics. Such
a formulation is beneficial because it is both model and metric agnostic and
provides an interpretable output for the decision-maker. We test our approach
by showing a practical application in electricity demand forecasting. Our
results suggest that when we allow for dataset split overlapping, the
performances of our methodology are consistently above the baseline model
trained on the whole dataset.</span>

                    <span>Reinforcement learning (RL) and brain-computer interfaces (BCI) are two
fields that have been growing over the past decade. Until recently, these
fields have operated independently of one another. With the rising interest in
human-in-the-loop (HITL) applications, RL algorithms have been adapted to
account for human guidance giving rise to the sub-field of interactive
reinforcement learning (IRL). Adjacently, BCI applications have been long
interested in extracting intrinsic feedback from neural activity during
human-computer interactions. These two ideas have set RL and BCI on a collision
course for one another through the integration of BCI into the IRL framework
where intrinsic feedback can be utilized to help train an agent. This
intersection has created a new and emerging paradigm denoted as intrinsic IRL.
To further help facilitate deeper ingratiation of BCI and IRL, we provide a
tutorial and review of intrinsic IRL so far with an emphasis on its parent
field of feedback-driven IRL along with discussions concerning validity,
challenges, and open problems.</span>

                    <span>Deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are broadly considered to be
state-of-the-art generic end-to-end image classification systems. However, they
are known to underperform when training data are limited and thus require data
augmentation strategies that render the method computationally expensive and
not always effective. Rather than using a data augmentation strategy to encode
invariances as typically done in machine learning, here we propose to
mathematically augment a nearest subspace classification model in
sliced-Wasserstein space by exploiting certain mathematical properties of the
Radon Cumulative Distribution Transform (R-CDT), a recently introduced image
transform. We demonstrate that for a particular type of learning problem, our
mathematical solution has advantages over data augmentation with deep CNNs in
terms of classification accuracy and computational complexity, and is
particularly effective under a limited training data setting. The method is
simple, effective, computationally efficient, non-iterative, and requires no
parameters to be tuned. Python code implementing our method is available at
https://github.com/rohdelab/mathematical_augmentation. Our method is integrated
as a part of the software package PyTransKit, which is available at

                    <span>Solar shading design should be done for the desired Indoor Environmental
Quality (IEQ) in the early design stages. This field can be very challenging
and time-consuming also requires experts, sophisticated software, and a large
amount of money. The primary purpose of this research is to design a simple
tool to study various models of solar shadings and make decisions easier and
faster in the early stages. Database generation methods, artificial
intelligence, and optimization have been used to achieve this goal. This tool
includes two main parts of 1. predicting the performance of the user-selected
model along with proposing effective parameters and 2. proposing optimal
pre-prepared models to the user. In this regard, initially, a side-lit shoebox
model with variable parameters was modeled parametrically, and five common
solar shading models with their variables were applied to the space. For each
solar shadings and the state without shading, metrics related to daylight and
glare, view, and initial costs were simulated. The database generated in this
research includes 87912 alternatives and six calculated metrics introduced to
optimized machine learning models, including neural network, random Forrest,
support vector regression, and k nearest neighbor. According to the results,
the most accurate and fastest estimation model was Random Forrest, with an
r2_score of 0.967 to 1. Then, sensitivity analysis was performed to identify
the most influential parameters for each shading model and the state without
it. This analysis distinguished the most effective parameters, including window
orientation, WWR, room width, length, and shading depth. Finally, by optimizing
the estimation function of machine learning models with the NSGA II algorithm,
about 7300 optimal models were identified. The developed tool can evaluate
various design alternatives in less than a few seconds for each.</span>

from very different domains. In using such synthetic data for pre-training, we
find that downstream performance on different tasks are favored by different
configurations of simulation parameters (e.g. lighting, object pose,
backgrounds, etc.), and that there is no one-size-fits-all solution. It is thus
better to tailor synthetic pre-training data to a specific downstream task, for
best performance. We introduce Task2Sim, a unified model mapping downstream
task representations to optimal simulation parameters to generate synthetic
pre-training data for them. Task2Sim learns this mapping by training to find
the set of best parameters on a set of &quot;seen&quot; tasks. Once trained, it can then
be used to predict best simulation parameters for novel &quot;unseen&quot; tasks in one
shot, without requiring additional training. Given a budget in number of images
per class, our extensive experiments with 20 diverse downstream tasks show
Task2Sim&#x27;s task-adaptive pre-training data results in significantly better
downstream performance than non-adaptively choosing simulation parameters on
both seen and unseen tasks. It is even competitive with pre-training on real
images from Imagenet.</span>

                    <span>This paper proposes an automated segmentation method of infection and normal
regions in the lung from CT volumes of COVID-19 patients. From December 2019,
novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) spreads over the world and giving
significant impacts to our economic activities and daily lives. To diagnose the
large number of infected patients, diagnosis assistance by computers is needed.
Chest CT is effective for diagnosis of viral pneumonia including COVID-19. A
quantitative analysis method of condition of the lung from CT volumes by
computers is required for diagnosis assistance of COVID-19. This paper proposes
an automated segmentation method of infection and normal regions in the lung
from CT volumes using a COVID-19 segmentation fully convolutional network
(FCN). In diagnosis of lung diseases including COVID-19, analysis of conditions
of normal and infection regions in the lung is important. Our method recognizes
and segments lung normal and infection regions in CT volumes. To segment
infection regions that have various shapes and sizes, we introduced dense
pooling connections and dilated convolutions in our FCN. We applied the
proposed method to CT volumes of COVID-19 cases. From mild to severe cases of
COVID-19, the proposed method correctly segmented normal and infection regions
in the lung. Dice scores of normal and infection regions were 0.911 and 0.753,
respectively.</span>

                    <span>Graph neural networks (GNNs) are deep learning architectures for machine
learning problems on graphs. It has recently been shown that the expressiveness
of GNNs can be characterised precisely by the combinatorial Weisfeiler-Leman
algorithms and by finite variable counting logics. The correspondence has even
led to new, higher-order GNNs corresponding to the WL algorithm in higher
dimensions.

The purpose of this paper is to explain these descriptive characterisations
of GNNs.</span>

                    <span>Data imputation has been extensively explored to solve the missing data
problem. The dramatically increasing volume of incomplete data makes the
imputation models computationally infeasible in many real-life applications. In
this paper, we propose an effective scalable imputation system named SCIS to
significantly speed up the training of the differentiable generative
adversarial imputation models under accuracy-guarantees for large-scale
incomplete data. SCIS consists of two modules, differentiable imputation
modeling (DIM) and sample size estimation (SSE). DIM leverages a new masking
Sinkhorn divergence function to make an arbitrary generative adversarial
imputation model differentiable, while for such a differentiable imputation
model, SSE can estimate an appropriate sample size to ensure the user-specified
imputation accuracy of the final model. Extensive experiments upon several
real-life large-scale datasets demonstrate that, our proposed system can
accelerate the generative adversarial model training by 7.1x. Using around 7.6%
samples, SCIS yields competitive accuracy with the state-of-the-art imputation
methods in a much shorter computation time.</span>

                    <span>Outcomes of data-driven AI models cannot be assumed to be always correct. To
estimate the uncertainty in these outcomes, the uncertainty wrapper framework
has been proposed, which considers uncertainties related to model fit, input
quality, and scope compliance. Uncertainty wrappers use a decision tree
approach to cluster input quality related uncertainties, assigning inputs
strictly to distinct uncertainty clusters. Hence, a slight variation in only
one feature may lead to a cluster assignment with a significantly different
uncertainty. Our objective is to replace this with an approach that mitigates
hard decision boundaries of these assignments while preserving
interpretability, runtime complexity, and prediction performance. Five
approaches were selected as candidates and integrated into the uncertainty
wrapper framework. For the evaluation based on the Brier score, datasets for a
pedestrian detection use case were generated using the CARLA simulator and
YOLOv3. All integrated approaches achieved a softening, i.e., smoothing, of
uncertainty estimation. Yet, compared to decision trees, they are not so easy
to interpret and have higher runtime complexity. Moreover, some components of
the Brier score impaired while others improved. Most promising regarding the
Brier score were random forests. In conclusion, softening hard decision tree
boundaries appears to be a trade-off decision.</span>

                    <span>Deep neural networks are powerful predictors for a variety of tasks. However,
they do not capture uncertainty directly. Using neural network ensembles to
quantify uncertainty is competitive with approaches based on Bayesian neural
networks while benefiting from better computational scalability. However,
building ensembles of neural networks is a challenging task because, in
addition to choosing the right neural architecture or hyperparameters for each
member of the ensemble, there is an added cost of training each model. We
propose AutoDEUQ, an automated approach for generating an ensemble of deep
neural networks. Our approach leverages joint neural architecture and
hyperparameter search to generate ensembles. We use the law of total variance
to decompose the predictive variance of deep ensembles into aleatoric (data)
and epistemic (model) uncertainties. We show that AutoDEUQ outperforms
probabilistic backpropagation, Monte Carlo dropout, deep ensemble,
distribution-free ensembles, and hyper ensemble methods on a number of
regression benchmarks.</span>

with heavy-tailed data in statistics and machine learning. This paper proposes
a log-truncated M-estimator for a large family of statistical regressions and
establishes its excess risk bound under the condition that the data have
$(1+\varepsilon)$-th moment with $\varepsilon \in (0,1]$. With an additional
assumption on the associated risk function, we obtain an $\ell_2$-error bound
for the estimation. Our theorems are applied to establish robust M-estimators
for concrete regressions. Besides convex regressions such as quantile
regression and generalized linear models, many non-convex regressions can also
be fit into our theorems, we focus on robust deep neural network regressions,
which can be solved by the stochastic gradient descent algorithms. Simulations
and real data analysis demonstrate the superiority of log-truncated estimations

                    <span>Approximate Bayesian inference methods provide a powerful suite of tools for
finding approximations to intractable posterior distributions. However, machine
learning applications typically involve selecting actions, which -- in a
Bayesian setting -- depend on the posterior distribution only via its
contribution to expected utility. A growing body of work on loss-calibrated
approximate inference methods has therefore sought to develop posterior
approximations sensitive to the influence of the utility function. Here we
introduce loss-calibrated expectation propagation (Loss-EP), a loss-calibrated
variant of expectation propagation. This method resembles standard EP with an
additional factor that &quot;tilts&quot; the posterior towards higher-utility decisions.
We show applications to Gaussian process classification under binary utility
functions with asymmetric penalties on False Negative and False Positive
errors, and show how this asymmetry can have dramatic consequences on what
information is &quot;useful&quot; to capture in an approximation.</span>

                    <span>Large-scale pre-trained language models have achieved tremendous success
across a wide range of natural language understanding (NLU) tasks, even
surpassing human performance. However, recent studies reveal that the
robustness of these models can be challenged by carefully crafted textual
adversarial examples. While several individual datasets have been proposed to
evaluate model robustness, a principled and comprehensive benchmark is still
missing. In this paper, we present Adversarial GLUE (AdvGLUE), a new multi-task
benchmark to quantitatively and thoroughly explore and evaluate the
vulnerabilities of modern large-scale language models under various types of
adversarial attacks. In particular, we systematically apply 14 textual
adversarial attack methods to GLUE tasks to construct AdvGLUE, which is further
validated by humans for reliable annotations. Our findings are summarized as
follows. (i) Most existing adversarial attack algorithms are prone to
generating invalid or ambiguous adversarial examples, with around 90% of them
either changing the original semantic meanings or misleading human annotators
as well. Therefore, we perform a careful filtering process to curate a
high-quality benchmark. (ii) All the language models and robust training
methods we tested perform poorly on AdvGLUE, with scores lagging far behind the
benign accuracy. We hope our work will motivate the development of new
adversarial attacks that are more stealthy and semantic-preserving, as well as
new robust language models against sophisticated adversarial attacks. AdvGLUE
is available at https://adversarialglue.github.io.</span>

                    <span>Deep neural networks based purely on attention have been successful across
several domains, relying on minimal architectural priors from the designer. In
Human Action Recognition (HAR), attention mechanisms have been primarily
adopted on top of standard convolutional or recurrent layers, improving the
overall generalization capability. In this work, we introduce Action
Transformer (AcT), a simple, fully self-attentional architecture that
consistently outperforms more elaborated networks that mix convolutional,
recurrent and attentive layers. In order to limit computational and energy
requests, building on previous human action recognition research, the proposed
approach exploits 2D pose representations over small temporal windows,
providing a low latency solution for accurate and effective real-time
performance. Moreover, we open-source MPOSE2021, a new large-scale dataset, as
an attempt to build a formal training and evaluation benchmark for real-time,
short-time HAR. The proposed methodology was extensively tested on MPOSE2021
and compared to several state-of-the-art architectures, proving the
effectiveness of the AcT model and laying the foundations for future work on
HAR.</span>

                    <span>Federated learning is an emerging decentralized machine learning scheme that
allows multiple data owners to work collaboratively while ensuring data
privacy. The success of federated learning depends largely on the participation
of data owners. To sustain and encourage data owners&#x27; participation, it is
crucial to fairly evaluate the quality of the data provided by the data owners
and reward them correspondingly. Federated Shapley value, recently proposed by
Wang et al. [Federated Learning, 2020], is a measure for data value under the
framework of federated learning that satisfies many desired properties for data
valuation. However, there are still factors of potential unfairness in the
design of federated Shapley value because two data owners with the same local
data may not receive the same evaluation. We propose a new measure called
completed federated Shapley value to improve the fairness of federated Shapley
value. The design depends on completing a matrix consisting of all the possible
contributions by different subsets of the data owners. It is shown under mild
conditions that this matrix is approximately low-rank by leveraging concepts
and tools from optimization. Both theoretical analysis and empirical evaluation
verify that the proposed measure does improve fairness in many circumstances.</span>

                    <span>The goal of this study was to develop new reliable open surgery suturing
simulation system for training medical students in situation where resources
are limited or in the domestic setup. Namely, we developed an algorithm for
tools and hands localization as well as identifying the interactions between
them based on simple webcam video data, calculating motion metrics for
assessment of surgical skill. Twenty-five participants performed multiple
suturing tasks using our simulator. The YOLO network has been modified to a
multi-task network, for the purpose of tool localization and tool-hand
interaction detection. This was accomplished by splitting the YOLO detection
heads so that they supported both tasks with minimal addition to computer
run-time. Furthermore, based on the outcome of the system, motion metrics were
calculated. These metrics included traditional metrics such as time and path
length as well as new metrics assessing the technique participants use for
holding the tools. The dual-task network performance was similar to that of two
networks, while computational load was only slightly bigger than one network.
In addition, the motion metrics showed significant differences between experts
and novices. While video capture is an essential part of minimally invasive
surgery, it is not an integral component of open surgery. Thus, new algorithms,
focusing on the unique challenges open surgery videos present, are required. In
this study, a dual-task network was developed to solve both a localization task
and a hand-tool interaction task. The dual network may be easily expanded to a
multi-task network, which may be useful for images with multiple layers and for
evaluating the interaction between these different layers.</span>

                    <span>Recent advances in unsupervised domain adaptation have shown that mitigating
the domain divergence by extracting the domain-invariant representation could
significantly improve the generalization of a model to an unlabeled data
domain. Nevertheless, the existing methods fail to effectively preserve the
representation that is private to the label-missing domain, which could
adversely affect the generalization. In this paper, we propose an approach to
preserve such representation so that the latent distribution of the unlabeled
domain could represent both the domain-invariant features and the individual
characteristics that are private to the unlabeled domain. In particular, we
demonstrate that maximizing the mutual information between the unlabeled domain
and its latent space while mitigating the domain divergence can achieve such
preservation. We also theoretically and empirically validate that preserving
the representation that is private to the unlabeled domain is important and of
necessity for the cross-domain generalization. Our approach outperforms
state-of-the-art methods on several public datasets.</span>

                    <span>Early detection of COVID-19 is an ongoing area of research that can help with
triage, monitoring and general health assessment of potential patients and may
reduce operational strain on hospitals that cope with the coronavirus pandemic.
Different machine learning techniques have been used in the literature to
detect coronavirus using routine clinical data (blood tests, and vital signs).
Data breaches and information leakage when using these models can bring
reputational damage and cause legal issues for hospitals. In spite of this,
protecting healthcare models against leakage of potentially sensitive
information is an understudied research area. In this work, we examine two
machine learning approaches, intended to predict a patient&#x27;s COVID-19 status
using routinely collected and readily available clinical data. We employ
adversarial training to explore robust deep learning architectures that protect
attributes related to demographic information about the patients. The two
models we examine in this work are intended to preserve sensitive information
against adversarial attacks and information leakage. In a series of experiments
using datasets from the Oxford University Hospitals, Bedfordshire Hospitals NHS
Foundation Trust, University Hospitals Birmingham NHS Foundation Trust, and
Portsmouth Hospitals University NHS Trust we train and test two neural networks
that predict PCR test results using information from basic laboratory blood
tests, and vital signs performed on a patients&#x27; arrival to hospital. We assess
the level of privacy each one of the models can provide and show the efficacy
and robustness of our proposed architectures against a comparable baseline. One
of our main contributions is that we specifically target the development of
effective COVID-19 detection models with built-in mechanisms in order to
selectively protect sensitive attributes against adversarial attacks.</span>

                    <span>In comparison to classical shallow representation learning techniques, deep
neural networks have achieved superior performance in nearly every application
benchmark. But despite their clear empirical advantages, it is still not well
understood what makes them so effective. To approach this question, we
introduce deep frame approximation: a unifying framework for constrained
representation learning with structured overcomplete frames. While exact
inference requires iterative optimization, it may be approximated by the
operations of a feed-forward deep neural network. We indirectly analyze how
model capacity relates to frame structures induced by architectural
hyperparameters such as depth, width, and skip connections. We quantify these
structural differences with the deep frame potential, a data-independent
measure of coherence linked to representation uniqueness and stability. As a
criterion for model selection, we show correlation with generalization error on
a variety of common deep network architectures and datasets. We also
demonstrate how recurrent networks implementing iterative optimization
algorithms can achieve performance comparable to their feed-forward
approximations while improving adversarial robustness. This connection to the
established theory of overcomplete representations suggests promising new
directions for principled deep network architecture design with less reliance
on ad-hoc engineering.</span>

                    <span>In multi-agent reinforcement learning, the behaviors that agents learn in a
single Markov Game (MG) are typically confined to the given agent number (i.e.,
population size). Every single MG induced by varying population sizes may
possess distinct optimal joint strategies and game-specific knowledge, which
are modeled independently in modern multi-agent algorithms. In this work, we
focus on creating agents that generalize across population-varying MGs. Instead
of learning a unimodal policy, each agent learns a policy set that is formed by
effective strategies across a variety of games. We propose Meta Representations
for Agents (MRA) that explicitly models the game-common and game-specific
strategic knowledge. By representing the policy sets with multi-modal latent
policies, the common strategic knowledge and diverse strategic modes are
discovered with an iterative optimization procedure. We prove that as an
approximation to a constrained mutual information maximization objective, the
learned policies can reach Nash Equilibrium in every evaluation MG under the
assumption of Lipschitz game on a sufficiently large latent space. When
deploying it at practical latent models with limited size, fast adaptation can
be achieved by leveraging the first-order gradient information. Extensive
experiments show the effectiveness of MRA on both training performance and
generalization ability in hard and unseen games.</span>

life and property in the era of anthropogenic global warming. An early
prediction of landslide susceptibility using a data-driven approach is a demand
of time. In this study, we explored the eloquent features that best describe
landslide susceptibility with state-of-the-art machine learning methods. In our
study, we employed state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms including
XgBoost, LR, KNN, SVM, Adaboost for landslide susceptibility prediction. To
find the best hyperparameters of each individual classifier for optimized
performance, we have incorporated the Grid Search method, with 10 Fold
Cross-Validation. In this context, the optimized version of XgBoost
outperformed all other classifiers with a Cross-validation Weighted F1 score of
94.62%. Followed by this empirical evidence, we explored the XgBoost classifier
by incorporating TreeSHAP and identified eloquent features such as SLOPE,
ELEVATION, TWI that complement the performance of the XGBoost classifier mostly
and features such as LANDUSE, NDVI, SPI which has less effect on models
performance. According to the TreeSHAP explanation of features, we selected the
9 most significant landslide causal factors out of 15. Evidently, an optimized

                    <span>Data-Free Knowledge Distillation (KD) allows knowledge transfer from a
trained neural network (teacher) to a more compact one (student) in the absence
of original training data. Existing works use a validation set to monitor the
accuracy of the student over real data and report the highest performance
throughout the entire process. However, validation data may not be available at
distillation time either, making it infeasible to record the student snapshot
that achieved the peak accuracy. Therefore, a practical data-free KD method
should be robust and ideally provide monotonically increasing student accuracy
during distillation. This is challenging because the student experiences
knowledge degradation due to the distribution shift of the synthetic data. A
straightforward approach to overcome this issue is to store and rehearse the
generated samples periodically, which increases the memory footprint and
creates privacy concerns. We propose to model the distribution of the
previously observed synthetic samples with a generative network. In particular,
we design a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) with a training objective that is
customized to learn the synthetic data representations optimally. The student
is rehearsed by the generative pseudo replay technique, with samples produced
by the VAE. Hence knowledge degradation can be prevented without storing any
samples. Experiments on image classification benchmarks show that our method
optimizes the expected value of the distilled model accuracy while eliminating
the large memory overhead incurred by the sample-storing methods.</span>

                    <span>Comprehensive benchmarking of clustering algorithms is rendered difficult by
two key factors: (i)~the elusiveness of a unique mathematical definition of
this unsupervised learning approach and (ii)~dependencies between the
generating models or clustering criteria adopted by some clustering algorithms
and indices for internal cluster validation. Consequently, there is no
consensus regarding the best practice for rigorous benchmarking, and whether
this is possible at all outside the context of a given application. Here, we
argue that synthetic datasets must continue to play an important role in the
evaluation of clustering algorithms, but that this necessitates constructing
benchmarks that appropriately cover the diverse set of properties that impact
clustering algorithm performance. Through our framework, HAWKS, we demonstrate
the important role evolutionary algorithms play to support flexible generation
of such benchmarks, allowing simple modification and extension. We illustrate
two possible uses of our framework: (i)~the evolution of benchmark data
consistent with a set of hand-derived properties and (ii)~the generation of
datasets that tease out performance differences between a given pair of
algorithms. Our work has implications for the design of clustering benchmarks
that sufficiently challenge a broad range of algorithms, and for furthering
insight into the strengths and weaknesses of specific approaches.</span>

                    <span>Stethoscope-recorded chest sounds provide the opportunity for remote
cardio-respiratory health monitoring of neonates. However, reliable monitoring
requires high-quality heart and lung sounds. This paper presents novel
Non-negative Matrix Factorisation (NMF) and Non-negative Matrix
Co-Factorisation (NMCF) methods for neonatal chest sound separation. To assess
these methods and compare with existing single-source separation methods, an
artificial mixture dataset was generated comprising of heart, lung and noise
sounds. Signal-to-noise ratios were then calculated for these artificial
mixtures. These methods were also tested on real-world noisy neonatal chest
sounds and assessed based on vital sign estimation error and a signal quality
score of 1-5 developed in our previous works. Additionally, the computational
cost of all methods was assessed to determine the applicability for real-time
processing. Overall, both the proposed NMF and NMCF methods outperform the next
best existing method by 2.7dB to 11.6dB for the artificial dataset and 0.40 to
1.12 signal quality improvement for the real-world dataset. The median
processing time for the sound separation of a 10s recording was found to be
28.3s for NMCF and 342ms for NMF. Because of stable and robust performance, we
believe that our proposed methods are useful to denoise neonatal heart and lung
sound in a real-world environment. Codes for proposed and existing methods can
be found at: https://github.com/egrooby-monash/Heart-and-Lung-Sound-Separation.</span>

                    <span>Inherent in virtually every iterative machine learning algorithm is the
problem of hyper-parameter tuning, which includes three major design
parameters: (a) the complexity of the model, e.g., the number of neurons in a
neural network, (b) the initial conditions, which heavily affect the behavior
of the algorithm, and (c) the dissimilarity measure used to quantify its
performance. We introduce an online prototype-based learning algorithm that can
be viewed as a progressively growing competitive-learning neural network
architecture for classification and clustering. The learning rule of the
proposed approach is formulated as an online gradient-free stochastic
approximation algorithm that solves a sequence of appropriately defined
optimization problems, simulating an annealing process. The annealing nature of
the algorithm contributes to avoiding poor local minima, offers robustness with
respect to the initial conditions, and provides a means to progressively
increase the complexity of the learning model, through an intuitive bifurcation
phenomenon. The proposed approach is interpretable, requires minimal
hyper-parameter tuning, and allows online control over the
performance-complexity trade-off. Finally, we show that Bregman divergences
appear naturally as a family of dissimilarity measures that play a central role
in both the performance and the computational complexity of the learning
algorithm.</span>

the feature-level algorithmic bias by taking advantage of conditional mutual
information. Although several bias measurement methods have been proposed and
widely investigated to achieve algorithmic fairness in various tasks such as
face recognition, their accuracy- or logit-based metrics are susceptible to
leading to trivial prediction score adjustment rather than fundamental bias
reduction. Hence, we design a novel debiasing framework against the algorithmic
bias, which incorporates a bias regularization loss derived by the proposed
information-theoretic bias measurement approach. In addition, we present a
simple yet effective unsupervised debiasing technique based on stochastic label
noise, which does not require the explicit supervision of bias information. The
proposed bias measurement and debiasing approaches are validated in diverse
realistic scenarios through extensive experiments on multiple standard
benchmarks.</span>

                    <span>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have become the state-of-the-art method for many
applications on graph structured data. GNNs are a framework for graph
representation learning, where a model learns to generate low dimensional node
embeddings that encapsulate structural and feature-related information. GNNs
are usually trained in an end-to-end fashion, leading to highly specialized
node embeddings. While this approach achieves great results in the single-task
setting, generating node embeddings that can be used to perform multiple tasks
(with performance comparable to single-task models) is still an open problem.
We propose a novel training strategy for graph representation learning, based
on meta-learning, which allows the training of a GNN model capable of producing
multi-task node embeddings. Our method avoids the difficulties arising when
learning to perform multiple tasks concurrently by, instead, learning to
quickly (i.e. with a few steps of gradient descent) adapt to multiple tasks
singularly. We show that the embeddings produced by a model trained with our
method can be used to perform multiple tasks with comparable or, surprisingly,
even higher performance than both single-task and multi-task end-to-end models.</span>

the lack of large datasets in the haptics domain often limits the applicability
of such techniques. This paper presents a general framework for the analysis of

                    <span>In this work we seek to bridge the concepts of topographic organization and
equivariance in neural networks. To accomplish this, we introduce the
Topographic VAE: a novel method for efficiently training deep generative models
with topographically organized latent variables. We show that such a model
indeed learns to organize its activations according to salient characteristics
such as digit class, width, and style on MNIST. Furthermore, through
topographic organization over time (i.e. temporal coherence), we demonstrate
how predefined latent space transformation operators can be encouraged for
observed transformed input sequences -- a primitive form of unsupervised
learned equivariance. We demonstrate that this model successfully learns sets
of approximately equivariant features (i.e. &quot;capsules&quot;) directly from sequences
and achieves higher likelihood on correspondingly transforming test sequences.
Equivariance is verified quantitatively by measuring the approximate
commutativity of the inference network and the sequence transformations.
Finally, we demonstrate approximate equivariance to complex transformations,
expanding upon the capabilities of existing group equivariant neural networks.</span>

parts. In machine learning, Mercer&#x27;s theorem generalizes this idea, providing
for any kernel and input distribution a natural basis of functions of
increasing frequency. More recently, several works have extended this analysis
to deep neural networks through the framework of Neural Tangent Kernel. In this
work, we analyze the layer-wise spectral bias of Deep Neural Networks and
relate it to the contributions of different layers in the reduction of
generalization error for a given target function. We utilize the properties of
Hermite polynomials and Spherical Harmonics to prove that initial layers
exhibit a larger bias towards high-frequency functions defined on the unit

                    <span>The prosperity of artificial intelligence has aroused intensive interests in
intelligent/autonomous navigation, in which path prediction is a key
functionality for decision supports, e.g. route planning, collision warning,
and traffic regulation. For maritime intelligence, Automatic Identification
System (AIS) plays an important role because it recently has been made
compulsory for large international commercial vessels and is able to provide
nearly real-time information of the vessel. Therefore AIS data based vessel
path prediction is a promising way in future maritime intelligence. However,
real-world AIS data collected online are just highly irregular trajectory
segments (AIS message sequences) from different types of vessels and
geographical regions, with possibly very low data quality. So even there are
some works studying how to build a path prediction model using historical AIS
data, but still, it is a very challenging problem. In this paper, we propose a
comprehensive framework to model massive historical AIS trajectory segments for
accurate vessel path prediction. Experimental comparisons with existing popular
methods are made to validate the proposed approach and results show that our
approach could outperform the baseline methods by a wide margin.</span>

                    <span>The quasiparticle effective mass $m^\ast$ of interacting electrons is a
fundamental quantity in the Fermi liquid theory. However, the precise value of
the effective mass of uniform electron gas is still elusive after decades of
research. The newly developed neural canonical transformation approach
arXiv:2105.08644 offers a principled way to extract the effective mass of
electron gas by directly calculating the thermal entropy at low temperature.
The approach models a variational many-electron density matrix using two
generative neural networks: an autoregressive model for momentum occupation and
a normalizing flow for electron coordinates. Our calculation reveals a
suppression of effective mass in the two-dimensional spin-polarized electron
gas, which is more pronounced than previous reports in the low-density
strong-coupling region. This prediction calls for verification in
two-dimensional electron gas experiments.</span>

                    <span>With the development of traffic prediction technology, spatiotemporal
prediction models have attracted more and more attention from academia
communities and industry. However, most existing researches focus on reducing
model&#x27;s prediction error but ignore the error caused by the uneven distribution
of spatial events within a region. In this paper, we study a region
partitioning problem, namely optimal grid size selection problem (OGSS), which
aims to minimize the real error of spatiotemporal prediction models by
selecting the optimal grid size. In order to solve OGSS, we analyze the upper
bound of real error of spatiotemporal prediction models and minimize the real
error by minimizing its upper bound. Through in-depth analysis, we find that
the upper bound of real error will decrease then increase when the number of
model grids increase from 1 to the maximum allowed value. Then, we propose two
algorithms, namely Ternary Search and Iterative Method, to automatically find
the optimal grid size. Finally, the experiments verify that the error of
prediction has the same trend as its upper bound, and the change trend of the
upper bound of real error with respect to the increase of the number of model
grids will decrease then increase. Meanwhile, in a case study, by selecting the
optimal grid size, the order dispatching results of a state-of-the-art
prediction-based algorithm can be improved up to 13.6%, which shows the
effectiveness of our methods on tuning the region partition for spatiotemporal
prediction models.</span>

                    <span>Developing scalable solutions for training Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for
link prediction tasks is challenging due to the high data dependencies which
entail high computational cost and huge memory footprint. We propose a new
method for scaling training of knowledge graph embedding models for link
prediction to address these challenges. Towards this end, we propose the
following algorithmic strategies: self-sufficient partitions, constraint-based
negative sampling, and edge mini-batch training. Both, partitioning strategy
and constraint-based negative sampling, avoid cross partition data transfer
during training. In our experimental evaluation, we show that our scaling
solution for GNN-based knowledge graph embedding models achieves a 16x speed up
on benchmark datasets while maintaining a comparable model performance as
non-distributed methods on standard metrics.</span>

                    <span>Recent success of deep neural networks (DNNs) hinges on the availability of
large-scale dataset; however, training on such dataset often poses privacy
risks for sensitive training information. In this paper, we aim to explore the
power of generative models and gradient sparsity, and propose a scalable
privacy-preserving generative model DATALENS. Comparing with the standard PATE
privacy-preserving framework which allows teachers to vote on one-dimensional
predictions, voting on the high dimensional gradient vectors is challenging in
terms of privacy preservation. As dimension reduction techniques are required,
we need to navigate a delicate tradeoff space between (1) the improvement of
privacy preservation and (2) the slowdown of SGD convergence. To tackle this,
we take advantage of communication efficient learning and propose a novel noise
compression and aggregation approach TOPAGG by combining top-k compression for
dimension reduction with a corresponding noise injection mechanism. We
theoretically prove that the DATALENS framework guarantees differential privacy
for its generated data, and provide analysis on its convergence. To demonstrate
the practical usage of DATALENS, we conduct extensive experiments on diverse
datasets including MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, and high dimensional CelebA, and we
show that, DATALENS significantly outperforms other baseline DP generative
models. In addition, we adapt the proposed TOPAGG approach, which is one of the
key building blocks in DATALENS, to DP SGD training, and show that it is able
to achieve higher utility than the state-of-the-art DP SGD approach in most
cases. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/AI-secure/DataLens.</span>

                    <span>Automated audio captioning (AAC) aims to describe audio data with captions
using natural language. Most existing AAC methods adopt an encoder-decoder
structure, where the attention based mechanism is a popular choice in the
decoder (e.g., Transformer decoder) for predicting captions from audio
features. Such attention based decoders can capture the global information from
the audio features, however, their ability in extracting local information can
be limited, which may lead to degraded quality in the generated captions. In
this paper, we present an AAC method with an attention-free decoder, where an
encoder based on PANNs is employed for audio feature extraction, and the
attention-free decoder is designed to introduce local information. The proposed
method enables the effective use of both global and local information from
audio signals. Experiments show that our method outperforms the
state-of-the-art methods with the standard attention based decoder in Task 6 of
the DCASE 2021 Challenge.</span>

                    <span>Driven by the key challenges of cell therapy manufacturing, including high
complexity, high uncertainty, and very limited process data, we propose a
stochastic optimization framework named &quot;hybrid-RL&quot; to efficiently guide
process development and control. We first create the bioprocess probabilistic
knowledge graph that is a hybrid model characterizing the understanding of
biomanufacturing process mechanisms and quantifying inherent stochasticity,
such as batch-to-batch variation and bioprocess noise. It can capture the key
features, including nonlinear reactions, time-varying kinetics, and partially
observed bioprocess state. This hybrid model can leverage on existing
mechanistic models and facilitate the learning from process data. Given limited
process data, a computational sampling approach is used to generate posterior
samples quantifying the model estimation uncertainty. Then, we introduce hybrid
model-based Bayesian reinforcement learning (RL), accounting for both inherent
stochasticity and model uncertainty, to guide optimal, robust, and
interpretable decision making, which can overcome the key challenges of cell
therapy manufacturing. In the empirical study, cell therapy manufacturing
examples are used to demonstrate that the proposed hybrid-RL framework can
outperform the classical deterministic mechanistic model assisted process
optimization.</span>

metrics often assume that both representations and ground-truth factors are
flat, continuous, and factorized, whereas many real-world generative processes

                    <span>As the deep learning techniques have expanded to real-world recommendation
tasks, many deep neural network based Collaborative Filtering (CF) models have
been developed to project user-item interactions into latent feature space,
based on various neural architectures, such as multi-layer perceptron,
auto-encoder and graph neural networks. However, the majority of existing
collaborative filtering systems are not well designed to handle missing data.
Particularly, in order to inject the negative signals in the training phase,
these solutions largely rely on negative sampling from unobserved user-item
interactions and simply treating them as negative instances, which brings the
recommendation performance degradation. To address the issues, we develop a
Collaborative Reflection-Augmented Autoencoder Network (CRANet), that is
capable of exploring transferable knowledge from observed and unobserved
user-item interactions. The network architecture of CRANet is formed of an
integrative structure with a reflective receptor network and an information
fusion autoencoder module, which endows our recommendation framework with the
ability of encoding implicit user&#x27;s pairwise preference on both interacted and
non-interacted items. Additionally, a parametric regularization-based
tied-weight scheme is designed to perform robust joint training of the
two-stage CRANet model. We finally experimentally validate CRANet on four
diverse benchmark datasets corresponding to two recommendation tasks, to show
that debiasing the negative signals of user-item interactions improves the
performance as compared to various state-of-the-art recommendation techniques.

                    <span>In the theory of Partially Observed Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs),
existence of optimal policies have in general been established via converting
the original partially observed stochastic control problem to a fully observed
one on the belief space, leading to a belief-MDP. However, computing an optimal
policy for this fully observed model, and so for the original POMDP, using
classical dynamic or linear programming methods is challenging even if the
original system has finite state and action spaces, since the state space of
the fully observed belief-MDP model is always uncountable. Furthermore, there
exist very few rigorous value function approximation and optimal policy
approximation results, as regularity conditions needed often require a tedious
study involving the spaces of probability measures leading to properties such
as Feller continuity. In this paper, we study a planning problem for POMDPs
where the system dynamics and measurement channel model are assumed to be
known. We construct an approximate belief model by discretizing the belief
space using only finite window information variables. We then find optimal
policies for the approximate model and we rigorously establish near optimality
of the constructed finite window control policies in POMDPs under mild
non-linear filter stability conditions and the assumption that the measurement
and action sets are finite (and the state space is real vector valued). We also
establish a rate of convergence result which relates the finite window memory
size and the approximation error bound, where the rate of convergence is
exponential under explicit and testable exponential filter stability
conditions. While there exist many experimental results and few rigorous
asymptotic convergence results, an explicit rate of convergence result is new
in the literature, to our knowledge.</span>

computer-generated ones either addresses natural images versus computer
graphics or natural images versus GAN images, at a time. But in a real-world
image forensic scenario, it is highly essential to consider all categories of
image generation, since in most cases image generation is unknown. We, for the
first time, to our best knowledge, approach the problem of distinguishing
natural images from photo-realistic computer-generated images as a three-class
classification task classifying natural, computer graphics, and GAN images. For
the task, we propose a Multi-Colorspace fused EfficientNet model by parallelly
fusing three EfficientNet networks that follow transfer learning methodology
where each network operates in different colorspaces, RGB, LCH, and HSV, chosen
after analyzing the efficacy of various colorspace transformations in this
image forensics problem. Our model outperforms the baselines in terms of
accuracy, robustness towards post-processing, and generalizability towards
other datasets. We conduct psychophysics experiments to understand how
accurately humans can distinguish natural, computer graphics, and GAN images
where we could observe that humans find difficulty in classifying these images,
particularly the computer-generated images, indicating the necessity of
computational algorithms for the task. We also analyze the behavior of our
model through visual explanations to understand salient regions that contribute
to the model&#x27;s decision making and compare with manual explanations provided by
human participants in the form of region markings, where we could observe
similarities in both the explanations indicating the powerful nature of our
model to take the decisions meaningfully.</span>

edit, and efficiently transmit videos. Prior work has independently looked at
these problems (and sub-problems) and proposed different formulations. In this
work, we train a simple autoencoder (from scratch) on multiple frames of a
specific video. We observe: (1) latent codes learned by a video-specific
autoencoder capture spatial and temporal properties of that video; and (2)
autoencoders can project out-of-sample inputs onto the video-specific manifold.
These two properties allow us to explore, edit, and efficiently transmit a
video using one learned representation. For e.g., linear operations on latent
codes allow users to visualize the contents of a video. Associating latent
codes of a video and manifold projection enables users to make desired edits.
Interpolating latent codes and manifold projection allows the transmission of
sparse low-res frames over a network.</span>

                    <span>Historically, machine learning methods have not been designed with security
in mind. In turn, this has given rise to adversarial examples, carefully
perturbed input samples aimed to mislead detection at test time, which have
been applied to attack spam and malware classification, and more recently to
attack image classification. Consequently, an abundance of research has been
devoted to designing machine learning methods that are robust to adversarial
examples. Unfortunately, there are desiderata besides robustness that a secure
and safe machine learning model must satisfy, such as fairness and privacy.
Recent work by Song et al. (2019) has shown, empirically, that there exists a
trade-off between robust and private machine learning models. Models designed
to be robust to adversarial examples often overfit on training data to a larger
extent than standard (non-robust) models. If a dataset contains private
information, then any statistical test that separates training and test data by
observing a model&#x27;s outputs can represent a privacy breach, and if a model
overfits on training data, these statistical tests become easier.

In this work, we identify settings where standard models will overfit to a
larger extent in comparison to robust models, and as empirically observed in
previous works, settings where the opposite behavior occurs. Thus, it is not
necessarily the case that privacy must be sacrificed to achieve robustness. The
degree of overfitting naturally depends on the amount of data available for
training. We go on to characterize how the training set size factors into the
privacy risks exposed by training a robust model on a simple Gaussian data
task, and show empirically that our findings hold on image classification
benchmark datasets, such as CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100.</span>

regularization methods developed in the last few years, showing significant
improvements for different CNN models. The works are classified into three main
areas: the first one is called &quot;data augmentation&quot;, where all the techniques
focus on performing changes in the input data. The second, named &quot;internal
changes&quot;, which aims to describe procedures to modify the feature maps
generated by the neural network or the kernels. The last one, called &quot;label&quot;,
concerns transforming the labels of a given input. This work presents two main
differences comparing to other available surveys about regularization: (i) the
first concerns the papers gathered in the manuscript, which are not older than
five years, and (ii) the second distinction is about reproducibility, i.e., all
works refered here have their code available in public repositories or they
have been directly implemented in some framework, such as TensorFlow or Torch.</span>

                    <span>The precise age estimation of child sexual abuse and exploitation (CSAE)
victims is one of the most significant digital forensic challenges.
Investigators often need to determine the age of victims by looking at images
and interpreting the sexual development stages and other human characteristics.
The main priority - safeguarding children -- is often negatively impacted by a
huge forensic backlog, cognitive bias and the immense psychological stress that
this work can entail. This paper evaluates existing facial image datasets and
proposes a new dataset tailored to the needs of similar digital forensic
research contributions. This small, diverse dataset of 0 to 20-year-old
individuals contains 245 images and is merged with 82 unique images from the
FG-NET dataset, thus achieving a total of 327 images with high image diversity
and low age range density. The new dataset is tested on the Deep EXpectation
(DEX) algorithm pre-trained on the IMDB-WIKI dataset. The overall results for
young adolescents aged 10 to 15 and older adolescents/adults aged 16 to 20 are
very encouraging -- achieving MAEs as low as 1.79, but also suggest that the
accuracy for children aged 0 to 10 needs further work. In order to determine
the efficacy of the prototype, valuable input of four digital forensic experts,
including two forensic investigators, has been taken into account to improve
age estimation results. Further research is required to extend datasets both
concerning image density and the equal distribution of factors such as gender
and racial diversity.</span>

                    <span>Most physical processes posses structural properties such as constant
energies, volumes, and other invariants over time. When learning models of such
dynamical systems, it is critical to respect these invariants to ensure
accurate predictions and physically meaningful behavior. Strikingly,
state-of-the-art methods in Gaussian process (GP) dynamics model learning are
not addressing this issue. On the other hand, classical numerical integrators
are specifically designed to preserve these crucial properties through time. We
propose to combine the advantages of GPs as function approximators with
structure preserving numerical integrators for dynamical systems, such as
Runge-Kutta methods. These integrators assume access to the ground truth
dynamics and require evaluations of intermediate and future time steps that are
unknown in a learning-based scenario. This makes direct inference of the GP
dynamics, with embedded numerical scheme, intractable. Our key technical
contribution is the evaluation of the implicitly defined Runge-Kutta transition
probability. In a nutshell, we introduce an implicit layer for GP regression,
which is embedded into a variational inference-based model learning scheme.</span>

                    <span>Post-click conversion, as a strong signal indicating the user preference, is
salutary for building recommender systems. However, accurately estimating the
post-click conversion rate (CVR) is challenging due to the selection bias,
i.e., the observed clicked events usually happen on users&#x27; preferred items.
Currently, most existing methods utilize counterfactual learning to debias
recommender systems. Among them, the doubly robust (DR) estimator has achieved
competitive performance by combining the error imputation based (EIB) estimator
and the inverse propensity score (IPS) estimator in a doubly robust way.
However, inaccurate error imputation may result in its higher variance than the
IPS estimator. Worse still, existing methods typically use simple
model-agnostic methods to estimate the imputation error, which are not
sufficient to approximate the dynamically changing model-correlated target
(i.e., the gradient direction of the prediction model). To solve these
problems, we first derive the bias and variance of the DR estimator. Based on
it, a more robust doubly robust (MRDR) estimator has been proposed to further
reduce its variance while retaining its double robustness. Moreover, we propose
a novel double learning approach for the MRDR estimator, which can convert the
error imputation into the general CVR estimation. Besides, we empirically
verify that the proposed learning scheme can further eliminate the high
variance problem of the imputation learning. To evaluate its effectiveness,
extensive experiments are conducted on a semi-synthetic dataset and two
real-world datasets. The results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed
approach over the state-of-the-art methods. The code is available at
https://github.com/guosyjlu/MRDR-DL.</span>

                    <span>We propose improving the cross-target and cross-scene generalization of
visual navigation through learning an agent that is guided by conceiving the
next observations it expects to see. This is achieved by learning a variational
Bayesian model, called NeoNav, which generates the next expected observations
(NEO) conditioned on the current observations of the agent and the target view.
Our generative model is learned through optimizing a variational objective
encompassing two key designs. First, the latent distribution is conditioned on
current observations and the target view, leading to a model-based,
target-driven navigation. Second, the latent space is modeled with a Mixture of
Gaussians conditioned on the current observation and the next best action. Our
use of mixture-of-posteriors prior effectively alleviates the issue of
over-regularized latent space, thus significantly boosting the model
generalization for new targets and in novel scenes. Moreover, the NEO
generation models the forward dynamics of agent-environment interaction, which
improves the quality of approximate inference and hence benefits data
efficiency. We have conducted extensive evaluations on both real-world and
synthetic benchmarks, and show that our model consistently outperforms the
state-of-the-art models in terms of success rate, data efficiency, and
generalization.</span>

                    <span>This study proposes a method to develop neural models of the morphological
analyzer for Japanese Hiragana sentences using the Bi-LSTM CRF model.
Morphological analysis is a technique that divides text data into words and
assigns information such as parts of speech. This technique plays an essential
role in downstream applications in Japanese natural language processing systems
because the Japanese language does not have word delimiters between words.
Hiragana is a type of Japanese phonogramic characters, which is used for texts
for children or people who cannot read Chinese characters. Morphological
analysis of Hiragana sentences is more difficult than that of ordinary Japanese
sentences because there is less information for dividing. For morphological
analysis of Hiragana sentences, we demonstrated the effectiveness of
fine-tuning using a model based on ordinary Japanese text and examined the
influence of training data on texts of various genres.</span>

                    <span>As humans, we navigate the world through all our senses, using perceptual
input from each one to correct the others. We introduce MERLOT Reserve, a model
that represents videos jointly over time -- through a new training objective
that learns from audio, subtitles, and video frames. Given a video, we replace
snippets of text and audio with a MASK token; the model learns by choosing the
correct masked-out snippet. Our objective learns faster than alternatives, and
performs well at scale: we pretrain on 20 million YouTube videos.

Empirical results show that MERLOT Reserve learns strong representations
about videos through all constituent modalities. When finetuned, it sets a new
state-of-the-art on both VCR and TVQA, outperforming prior work by 5% and 7%
respectively. Ablations show that both tasks benefit from audio pretraining --
even VCR, a QA task centered around images (without sound). Moreover, our
objective enables out-of-the-box prediction, revealing strong multimodal
commonsense understanding. In a fully zero-shot setting, our model obtains
competitive results on four video understanding tasks, even outperforming
supervised approaches on the recently proposed Situated Reasoning (STAR)
benchmark.

We analyze why incorporating audio leads to better vision-language
representations, suggesting significant opportunities for future research. We
conclude by discussing ethical and societal implications of multimodal
pretraining.</span>

                    <span>Few-sample compression aims to compress a big redundant model into a small
compact one with only few samples. If we fine-tune models with these limited
few samples directly, models will be vulnerable to overfit and learn almost
nothing. Hence, previous methods optimize the compressed model layer-by-layer
and try to make every layer have the same outputs as the corresponding layer in
the teacher model, which is cumbersome. In this paper, we propose a new
framework named Mimicking then Replacing (MiR) for few-sample compression,
which firstly urges the pruned model to output the same features as the
teacher&#x27;s in the penultimate layer, and then replaces teacher&#x27;s layers before
penultimate with a well-tuned compact one. Unlike previous layer-wise
reconstruction methods, our MiR optimizes the entire network holistically,
which is not only simple and effective, but also unsupervised and general. MiR
outperforms previous methods with large margins. Codes will be available soon.</span>

                    <span>Deep-learning-based models are increasingly used to emulate scientific
simulations to accelerate scientific research. However, accurate, supervised
deep learning models require huge amount of labelled data, and that often
becomes the bottleneck in employing neural networks. In this work, we leveraged
an active learning approach called core-set selection to actively select data,
per a pre-defined budget, to be labelled for training. To further improve the
model performance and reduce the training costs, we also warm started the
training using a shrink-and-perturb trick. We tested on two case studies in
different fields, namely galaxy halo occupation distribution modelling in
astrophysics and x-ray emission spectroscopy in plasma physics, and the results
are promising: we achieved competitive overall performance compared to using a

absolute losses, i.e. the long tail in the loss distribution, at virtually no
overhead costs.</span>

                    <span>Risk scores are widely used for clinical decision making and commonly
generated from logistic regression models. Machine-learning-based methods may
work well for identifying important predictors, but such &#x27;black box&#x27; variable
selection limits interpretability, and variable importance evaluated from a
single model can be biased. We propose a robust and interpretable variable
selection approach using the recently developed Shapley variable importance
cloud (ShapleyVIC) that accounts for variability across models. Our approach
evaluates and visualizes overall variable contributions for in-depth inference
and transparent variable selection, and filters out non-significant
contributors to simplify model building steps. We derive an ensemble variable
ranking from variable contributions, which is easily integrated with an
automated and modularized risk score generator, AutoScore, for convenient
implementation. In a study of early death or unplanned readmission, ShapleyVIC
selected 6 of 41 candidate variables to create a well-performing model, which
had similar performance to a 16-variable model from machine-learning-based
ranking.</span>

reason for supreme results in models employing Convolutional Neural Networks
(CNNs), conflicting with early works claiming that these networks identify
objects using shape. It is believed that the cost function forces the CNN to
take a greedy approach and develop a proclivity for local information like
texture to increase accuracy, thus failing to explore any global statistics. We
propose CognitiveCNN, a new intuitive architecture, inspired from feature
integration theory in psychology to utilise human interpretable feature like
shape, texture, edges etc. to reconstruct, and classify the image. We define
novel metrics to quantify the &quot;relevance&quot; of &quot;abstract information&quot; present in
these modalities using attention maps. We further introduce a regularisation
method which ensures that each modality like shape, texture etc. gets
proportionate influence in a given task, as it does for reconstruction; and
perform experiments to show the resulting boost in accuracy and robustness,
besides imparting explainability to these CNNs for achieving superior
performance in object recognition.</span>

                    <span>Multi-view learning is a learning problem that utilizes the various
representations of an object to mine valuable knowledge and improve the
performance of learning algorithm, and one of the significant directions of
multi-view learning is sub-space learning. As we known, auto-encoder is a
method of deep learning, which can learn the latent feature of raw data by
reconstructing the input, and based on this, we propose a novel algorithm
called Auto-encoder based Co-training Multi-View Learning (ACMVL), which
utilizes both complementarity and consistency and finds a joint latent feature
representation of multiple views. The algorithm has two stages, the first is to
train auto-encoder of each view, and the second stage is to train a supervised
network. Interestingly, the two stages share the weights partly and assist each
other by co-training process. According to the experimental result, we can
learn a well performed latent feature representation, and auto-encoder of each
view has more powerful reconstruction ability than traditional auto-encoder.</span>

significant success by exploring essential properties of videos, e.g. speed,
temporal order, etc. This work exploits an essential yet under-explored
property of videos, the video continuity, to obtain supervision signals for
self-supervised representation learning. Specifically, we formulate three novel
continuity-related pretext tasks, i.e. continuity justification, discontinuity
localization, and missing section approximation, that jointly supervise a
shared backbone for video representation learning. This self-supervision
approach, termed as Continuity Perception Network (CPNet), solves the three
tasks altogether and encourages the backbone network to learn local and
long-ranged motion and context representations. It outperforms prior arts on
multiple downstream tasks, such as action recognition, video retrieval, and
action localization. Additionally, the video continuity can be complementary to
other coarse-grained video properties for representation learning, and
integrating the proposed pretext task to prior arts can yield much performance
gains.</span>

                    <span>This paper presents an experiment of automatically scoring handwritten
descriptive answers in the trial tests for the new Japanese university entrance
examination, which were made for about 120,000 examinees in 2017 and 2018.
There are about 400,000 answers with more than 20 million characters. Although
all answers have been scored by human examiners, handwritten characters are not
labelled. We present our attempt to adapt deep neural network-based handwriting
recognizers trained on a labelled handwriting dataset into this unlabeled
answer set. Our proposed method combines different training strategies,
ensembles multiple recognizers, and uses a language model built from a large
general corpus to avoid overfitting into specific data. In our experiment, the
proposed method records character accuracy of over 97% using about 2,000
verified labelled answers that account for less than 0.5% of the dataset. Then,
the recognized answers are fed into a pre-trained automatic scoring system
based on the BERT model without correcting misrecognized characters and
providing rubric annotations. The automatic scoring system achieves from 0.84
to 0.98 of Quadratic Weighted Kappa (QWK). As QWK is over 0.8, it represents
acceptable similarity of scoring between the automatic scoring system and the
human examiners. These results are promising for further research on end-to-end
automatic scoring of descriptive answers.</span>

                    <span>Federated learning (FL) is a promising distributed learning technique
particularly suitable for wireless learning scenarios since it can accomplish a
learning task without raw data transportation so as to preserve data privacy
and lower network resource consumption. However, current works on FL over
wireless networks do not profoundly study the fundamental performance of FL
over wireless networks that suffers from communication outage due to channel
impairment and network interference. To accurately exploit the performance of
FL over wireless networks, this paper proposes a novel intermittent FL model
over a cellular-connected unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) network, which
characterizes communication outage from UAV (clients) to their server and data
heterogeneity among the datasets at UAVs. We propose an analytically tractable
framework to derive the uplink outage probability and use it to devise a
simulation-based approach so as to evaluate the performance of the proposed
intermittent FL model. Our findings reveal how the intermittent FL model is
impacted by uplink communication outage and UAV deployment. Extensive numerical
simulations are provided to show the consistency between the simulated and
analytical performances of the proposed intermittent FL model.</span>

                    <span>Identifying anomaly multimedia traffic in cyberspace is a big challenge in
distributed service systems, multiple generation networks and future internet
of everything. This letter explores meta-generalization for a multiparty
privacy learning model in graynet to improve the performance of anomaly
multimedia traffic identification. The multiparty privacy learning model in
graynet is a globally shared model that is partitioned, distributed and trained
by exchanging multiparty parameters updates with preserving private data. The
meta-generalization refers to discovering the inherent attributes of a learning
model to reduce its generalization error. In experiments, three
meta-generalization principles are tested as follows. The generalization error
of the multiparty privacy learning model in graynet is reduced by changing the
dimension of byte-level imbedding. Following that, the error is reduced by
adapting the depth for extracting packet-level features. Finally, the error is
reduced by adjusting the size of support set for preprocessing traffic-level
data. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposal outperforms the
state-of-the-art learning models for identifying anomaly multimedia traffic.</span>

                    <span>Learning-based Network Intrusion Detection Systems (NIDSs) are widely
deployed for defending various cyberattacks. Existing learning-based NIDS
mainly uses Neural Network (NN) as a classifier that relies on the quality and
quantity of cyberattack data. Such NN-based approaches are also hard to
interpret for improving efficiency and scalability. In this paper, we design a
new local-global computation paradigm, FEDFOREST, a novel learning-based NIDS
by combining the interpretable Gradient Boosting Decision Tree (GBDT) and
Federated Learning (FL) framework. Specifically, FEDFOREST is composed of
multiple clients that extract local cyberattack data features for the server to
train models and detect intrusions. A privacy-enhanced technology is also
proposed in FEDFOREST to further defeat the privacy of the FL systems.
Extensive experiments on 4 cyberattack datasets of different tasks demonstrate
that FEDFOREST is effective, efficient, interpretable, and extendable.
FEDFOREST ranks first in the collaborative learning and cybersecurity
competition 2021 for Chinese college students.</span>

                    <span>We develop a structural econometric model to capture the decision dynamics of
human evaluators on an online micro-lending platform, and estimate the model
parameters using a real-world dataset. We find two types of biases in gender,
preference-based bias and belief-based bias, are present in human evaluators&#x27;
decisions. Both types of biases are in favor of female applicants. Through
counterfactual simulations, we quantify the effect of gender bias on loan
granting outcomes and the welfare of the company and the borrowers. Our results
imply that both the existence of the preference-based bias and that of the
belief-based bias reduce the company&#x27;s profits. When the preference-based bias
is removed, the company earns more profits. When the belief-based bias is
removed, the company&#x27;s profits also increase. Both increases result from
raising the approval probability for borrowers, especially male borrowers, who
eventually pay back loans. For borrowers, the elimination of either bias
decreases the gender gap of the true positive rates in the credit risk
evaluation. We also train machine learning algorithms on both the real-world
data and the data from the counterfactual simulations. We compare the decisions
made by those algorithms to see how evaluators&#x27; biases are inherited by the
algorithms and reflected in machine-based decisions. We find that machine
learning algorithms can mitigate both the preference-based bias and the
belief-based bias.</span>

                    <span>Federated learning often suffers from unstable and slow convergence due to
heterogeneous characteristics of participating clients. Such tendency is
aggravated when the client participation ratio is low since the information
collected from the clients at each round is prone to be more inconsistent. To
tackle the challenge, we propose a novel federated learning framework, which
improves the stability of the server-side aggregation step, which is achieved
by sending the clients an accelerated model estimated with the global gradient
to guide the local gradient updates. Our algorithm naturally aggregates and
conveys the global update information to participants with no additional
communication cost and does not require to store the past models in the
clients. We also regularize local update to further reduce the bias and improve
the stability of local updates. We perform comprehensive empirical studies on
real data under various settings and demonstrate the remarkable performance of
the proposed method in terms of accuracy and communication-efficiency compared
to the state-of-the-art methods, especially with low client participation
rates. Our code is available at https://github.com/ ninigapa0/FedAGM</span>

(DP-SCO) with heavy-tailed data. Specifically, we focus on the $\ell_1$-norm
linear regression in the $\epsilon$-DP model. While most of the previous work
focuses on the case where the loss function is Lipschitz, here we only need to
assume the variates has bounded moments. Firstly, we study the case where the
$\ell_2$ norm of data has bounded second order moment. We propose an algorithm
which is based on the exponential mechanism and show that it is possible to
achieve an upper bound of $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{\frac{d}{n\epsilon}})$ (with high
probability). Next, we relax the assumption to bounded $\theta$-th order moment
with some $\theta\in (1, 2)$ and show that it is possible to achieve an upper
bound of $\tilde{O}(({\frac{d}{n\epsilon}})^\frac{\theta-1}{\theta})$. Our
algorithms can also be extended to more relaxed cases where only each
coordinate of the data has bounded moments, and we can get an upper bound of
$\tilde{O}({\frac{d}{\sqrt{n\epsilon}}})$ and
$\tilde{O}({\frac{d}{({n\epsilon})^\frac{\theta-1}{\theta}}})$ in the second
and $\theta$-th moment case respectively.</span>

                    <span>Trajectory Prediction (TP) is an important research topic in computer vision
and robotics fields. Recently, many stochastic TP models have been proposed to
deal with this problem and have achieved better performance than the
traditional models with deterministic trajectory outputs. However, these
stochastic models can generate a number of future trajectories with different
qualities. They are lack of self-evaluation ability, that is, to examine the
rationality of their prediction results, thus failing to guide users to
identify high-quality ones from their candidate results. This hinders them from
playing their best in real applications. In this paper, we make up for this
defect and propose TPAD, a novel TP evaluation method based on the trajectory
Anomaly Detection (AD) technique. In TPAD, we firstly combine the Automated
Machine Learning (AutoML) technique and the experience in the AD and TP field
to automatically design an effective trajectory AD model. Then, we utilize the
learned trajectory AD model to examine the rationality of the predicted
trajectories, and screen out good TP results for users. Extensive experimental
results demonstrate that TPAD can effectively identify near-optimal prediction
results, improving stochastic TP models&#x27; practical application effect.</span>

                    <span>Consider two or more forecasters, each making a sequence of predictions for
different events over time. We ask a relatively basic question: how might we
compare these forecasters, either online or post-hoc, while avoiding
unverifiable assumptions on how the forecasts or outcomes were generated? This
work presents a novel and rigorous answer to this question. We design a
sequential inference procedure for estimating the time-varying difference in
forecast quality as measured by any scoring rule. The resulting confidence
intervals are nonasymptotically valid and can be continuously monitored to
yield statistically valid comparisons at arbitrary data-dependent stopping
times (&quot;anytime-valid&quot;); this is enabled by adapting variance-adaptive
supermartingales, confidence sequences, and e-processes to our setting.
Motivated by Shafer and Vovk&#x27;s game-theoretic probability, our coverage
guarantees are also distribution-free, in the sense that they make no
distributional assumptions on the forecasts or outcomes. In contrast to a
recent work by Henzi and Ziegel, our tools can sequentially test a weak null
hypothesis about whether one forecaster outperforms another on average over
time. We demonstrate their effectiveness by comparing probability forecasts on
Major League Baseball (MLB) games and statistical postprocessing methods for
ensemble weather forecasts.</span>

                    <span>This paper studies the problem of learning causal structures from
observational data. We reformulate the Structural Equation Model (SEM) with
additive noises in a form parameterized by binary graph adjacency matrix and
show that, if the original SEM is identifiable, then the binary adjacency
matrix can be identified up to super-graphs of the true causal graph under mild
conditions. We then utilize the reformulated SEM to develop a causal structure
learning method that can be efficiently trained using gradient-based
optimization, by leveraging a smooth characterization on acyclicity and the
Gumbel-Softmax approach to approximate the binary adjacency matrix. It is found
that the obtained entries are typically near zero or one and can be easily
thresholded to identify the edges. We conduct experiments on synthetic and real
datasets to validate the effectiveness of the proposed method, and show that it
readily includes different smooth model functions and achieves a much improved
performance on most datasets considered.</span>

                    <span>We study generalization bounds for noisy stochastic mini-batch iterative
algorithms based on the notion of stability. Recent years have seen key
advances in data-dependent generalization bounds for noisy iterative learning
algorithms such as stochastic gradient Langevin dynamics (SGLD) based on
stability (Mou et al., 2018; Li et al., 2020) and information theoretic
approaches (Xu and Raginsky, 2017; Negrea et al., 2019; Steinke and
Zakynthinou, 2020; Haghifam et al., 2020). In this paper, we unify and
substantially generalize stability based generalization bounds and make three
technical advances. First, we bound the generalization error of general noisy
stochastic iterative algorithms (not necessarily gradient descent) in terms of
expected (not uniform) stability. The expected stability can in turn be bounded
by a Le Cam Style Divergence. Such bounds have a O(1/n) sample dependence
unlike many existing bounds with O(1/\sqrt{n}) dependence. Second, we introduce
Exponential Family Langevin Dynamics(EFLD) which is a substantial
generalization of SGLD and which allows exponential family noise to be used
with stochastic gradient descent (SGD). We establish data-dependent expected
stability based generalization bounds for general EFLD algorithms. Third, we
consider an important special case of EFLD: noisy sign-SGD, which extends
sign-SGD using Bernoulli noise over {-1,+1}. Generalization bounds for noisy
sign-SGD are implied by that of EFLD and we also establish optimization
guarantees for the algorithm. Further, we present empirical results on
benchmark datasets to illustrate that our bounds are non-vacuous and
quantitatively much sharper than existing bounds.</span>

                    <span>This paper presents a novel and fast solver for the J2-perturbed Lambert
problem. The solver consists of an intelligent initial guess generator combined
with a differential correction procedure. The intelligent initial guess
generator is a deep neural network that is trained to correct the initial
velocity vector coming from the solution of the unperturbed Lambert problem.
The differential correction module takes the initial guess and uses a forward
shooting procedure to further update the initial velocity and exactly meet the
terminal conditions. Eight sample forms are analyzed and compared to find the
optimum form to train the neural network on the J2-perturbed Lambert problem.
The accuracy and performance of this novel approach will be demonstrated on a
representative test case: the solution of a multi-revolution J2-perturbed
Lambert problem in the Jupiter system. We will compare the performance of the
proposed approach against a classical standard shooting method and a
homotopy-based perturbed Lambert algorithm. It will be shown that, for a
comparable level of accuracy, the proposed method is significantly faster than
the other two.</span>

                    <span>Models of human motion commonly focus either on trajectory prediction or
action classification but rarely both. The marked heterogeneity and intricate
compositionality of human motion render each task vulnerable to the data
degradation and distributional shift common to real-world scenarios. A
sufficiently expressive generative model of action could in theory enable data
conditioning and distributional resilience within a unified framework
applicable to both tasks. Here we propose a novel architecture based on
hierarchical variational autoencoders and deep graph convolutional neural
networks for generating a holistic model of action over multiple time-scales.
We show this Hierarchical Graph-convolutional Variational Autoencoder (HG-VAE)
to be capable of generating coherent actions, detecting out-of-distribution
data, and imputing missing data by gradient ascent on the model&#x27;s posterior.
Trained and evaluated on H3.6M and the largest collection of open source human
motion data, AMASS, we show HG-VAE can facilitate downstream discriminative
learning better than baseline models.</span>

                    <span>Deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) have become the most common
solution for automatic image annotation due to their non-parametric nature,
good performance, and their accessibility through libraries such as TensorFlow.
Among other fields, DCNNs are also a common approach to the annotation of large
astronomical image databases acquired by digital sky surveys. One of the main
downsides of DCNNs is the complex non-intuitive rules that make DCNNs act as a
&#x60;&#x60;black box&quot;, providing annotations in a manner that is unclear to the user.
Therefore, the user is often not able to know what information is used by the
DCNNs for the classification. Here we demonstrate that the training of a DCNN
is sensitive to the context of the training data such as the location of the
objects in the sky. We show that for basic classification of elliptical and
spiral galaxies, the sky location of the galaxies used for training affects the
behavior of the algorithm, and leads to a small but consistent and
statistically significant bias. That bias exhibits itself in the form of
cosmological-scale anisotropy in the distribution of basic galaxy morphology.
Therefore, while DCNNs are powerful tools for annotating images of extended
sources, the construction of training sets for galaxy morphology should take
into consideration more aspects than the visual appearance of the object. In
any case, catalogs created with deep neural networks that exhibit signs of
cosmological anisotropy should be interpreted with the possibility of
consistent bias.</span>

                    <span>This paper proposes a segmentation method of infection regions in the lung
from CT volumes of COVID-19 patients. COVID-19 spread worldwide, causing many
infected patients and deaths. CT image-based diagnosis of COVID-19 can provide
quick and accurate diagnosis results. An automated segmentation method of
infection regions in the lung provides a quantitative criterion for diagnosis.
Previous methods employ whole 2D image or 3D volume-based processes. Infection
regions have a considerable variation in their sizes. Such processes easily
miss small infection regions. Patch-based process is effective for segmenting
small targets. However, selecting the appropriate patch size is difficult in
infection region segmentation. We utilize the scale uncertainty among various
receptive field sizes of a segmentation FCN to obtain infection regions. The
receptive field sizes can be defined as the patch size and the resolution of
volumes where patches are clipped from. This paper proposes an infection
segmentation network (ISNet) that performs patch-based segmentation and a scale
uncertainty-aware prediction aggregation method that refines the segmentation
result. We design ISNet to segment infection regions that have various
intensity values. ISNet has multiple encoding paths to process patch volumes
normalized by multiple intensity ranges. We collect prediction results
generated by ISNets having various receptive field sizes. Scale uncertainty
among the prediction results is extracted by the prediction aggregation method.
We use an aggregation FCN to generate a refined segmentation result considering
scale uncertainty among the predictions. In our experiments using 199 chest CT
volumes of COVID-19 cases, the prediction aggregation method improved the dice
similarity score from 47.6% to 62.1%.</span>

                    <span>To protect sensitive data in training a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN),
the standard approach is to use differentially private (DP) stochastic gradient
descent method in which controlled noise is added to the gradients. The quality
of the output synthetic samples can be adversely affected and the training of
the network may not even converge in the presence of these noises. We propose
Differentially Private Model Inversion (DPMI) method where the private data is
first mapped to the latent space via a public generator, followed by a
lower-dimensional DP-GAN with better convergent properties. Experimental
results on standard datasets CIFAR10 and SVHN as well as on a facial landmark
dataset for Autism screening show that our approach outperforms the standard
DP-GAN method based on Inception Score, Fr\&#x27;echet Inception Distance, and
classification accuracy under the same privacy guarantee.</span>

                    <span>Vehicular Controller Area Networks (CANs) are susceptible to cyber attacks of
different levels of sophistication. Fabrication attacks are the easiest to
administer -- an adversary simply sends (extra) frames on a CAN -- but also the
easiest to detect because they disrupt frame frequency. To overcome time-based
detection methods, adversaries must administer masquerade attacks by sending
frames in lieu of (and therefore at the expected time of) benign frames but
with malicious payloads. Research efforts have proven that CAN attacks, and
masquerade attacks in particular, can affect vehicle functionality. Examples
include causing unintended acceleration, deactivation of vehicle&#x27;s brakes, as
well as steering the vehicle. We hypothesize that masquerade attacks modify the
nuanced correlations of CAN signal time series and how they cluster together.
Therefore, changes in cluster assignments should indicate anomalous behavior.
We confirm this hypothesis by leveraging our previously developed capability
for reverse engineering CAN signals (i.e., CAN-D [Controller Area Network
Decoder]) and focus on advancing the state of the art for detecting masquerade
attacks by analyzing time series extracted from raw CAN frames. Specifically,
we demonstrate that masquerade attacks can be detected by computing time series
clustering similarity using hierarchical clustering on the vehicle&#x27;s CAN
signals (time series) and comparing the clustering similarity across CAN
captures with and without attacks. We test our approach in a previously
collected CAN dataset with masquerade attacks (i.e., the ROAD dataset) and
develop a forensic tool as a proof of concept to demonstrate the potential of
the proposed approach for detecting CAN masquerade attacks.</span>

                    <span>Various work has suggested that the memorability of an image is consistent
across people, and thus can be treated as an intrinsic property of an image.
Using computer vision models, we can make specific predictions about what
people will remember or forget. While older work has used now-outdated deep
learning architectures to predict image memorability, innovations in the field
have given us new techniques to apply to this problem. Here, we propose and
evaluate five alternative deep learning models which exploit developments in
the field from the last five years, largely the introduction of residual neural
networks, which are intended to allow the model to use semantic information in
the memorability estimation process. These new models were tested against the
prior state of the art with a combined dataset built to optimize both
within-category and across-category predictions. Our findings suggest that the
key prior memorability network had overstated its generalizability and was
overfit on its training set. Our new models outperform this prior model,
leading us to conclude that Residual Networks outperform simpler convolutional
neural networks in memorability regression. We make our new state-of-the-art
model readily available to the research community, allowing memory researchers
to make predictions about memorability on a wider range of images.</span>

                    <span>Linear and Quadratic Discriminant Analysis are well-known classical methods
but can heavily suffer from non-Gaussian distributions and/or contaminated
datasets, mainly because of the underlying Gaussian assumption that is not
robust. To fill this gap, this paper presents a new robust discriminant
analysis where each data point is drawn by its own arbitrary Elliptically
Symmetrical (ES) distribution and its own arbitrary scale parameter. Such a
model allows for possibly very heterogeneous, independent but non-identically
distributed samples. After deriving a new decision rule, it is shown that
maximum-likelihood parameter estimation and classification are very simple,
fast and robust compared to state-of-the-art methods.</span>

ReLU activation function. Evaluation of the LS functional is done by using
numerical integration and conservative finite volume scheme. Numerical results
of some test problems show that the method is capable of approximating the

                    <span>Achieving universal translation between all human language pairs is the
holy-grail of machine translation (MT) research. While recent progress in
massively multilingual MT is one step closer to reaching this goal, it is
becoming evident that extending a multilingual MT system simply by training on
more parallel data is unscalable, since the availability of labeled data for
low-resource and non-English-centric language pairs is forbiddingly limited. To
this end, we present a pragmatic approach towards building a multilingual MT
model that covers hundreds of languages, using a mixture of supervised and
self-supervised objectives, depending on the data availability for different
language pairs. We demonstrate that the synergy between these two training
paradigms enables the model to produce high-quality translations in the
zero-resource setting, even surpassing supervised translation quality for low-
and mid-resource languages. We conduct a wide array of experiments to
understand the effect of the degree of multilingual supervision, domain
mismatches and amounts of parallel and monolingual data on the quality of our
self-supervised multilingual models. To demonstrate the scalability of the
approach, we train models with over 200 languages and demonstrate high
performance on zero-resource translation on several previously under-studied
languages. We hope our findings will serve as a stepping stone towards enabling
translation for the next thousand languages.</span>

Pathology (DP) domain is the high annotation cost by medical experts. One way
to tackle this issue is via transfer learning from the natural image domain
(NI), where the annotation cost is considerably cheaper. Cross-domain transfer
learning from NI to DP is shown to be successful via class
labels~\cite{teh2020learning}. One potential weakness of relying on class
labels is the lack of spatial information, which can be obtained from spatial
labels such as full pixel-wise segmentation labels and scribble labels. We
demonstrate that scribble labels from NI domain can boost the performance of DP
models on two cancer classification datasets (Patch Camelyon Breast Cancer and
Colorectal Cancer dataset). Furthermore, we show that models trained with
scribble labels yield the same performance boost as full pixel-wise
segmentation labels despite being significantly easier and faster to collect.</span>

success in a wide range of applications, their adoption in risk-sensitive
settings has been limited by the concerns on robustness and interpretability.
Previous works to examine robustness and to improve interpretability partially
exploited the piecewise linear function form of ReLU NNs. In this paper, we
explore the unique topological structure that ReLU NNs create in the input
space, identifying the adjacency among the partitioned local polytopes and
developing a traversing algorithm based on this adjacency. Our polytope
traversing algorithm can be adapted to verify a wide range of network
properties related to robustness and interpretability, providing an unified
approach to examine the network behavior. As the traversing algorithm
explicitly visits all local polytopes, it returns a clear and full picture of
the network behavior within the traversed region. The time and space complexity
of the traversing algorithm is determined by the number of a ReLU NN&#x27;s
partitioning hyperplanes passing through the traversing region.</span>

regression in high dimensions optimized by stochastic gradient descent (SGD).
In this regime, we derive precise non-asymptotic error bounds of RF regression
under both constant and adaptive step-size SGD setting, and observe the double
descent phenomenon both theoretically and empirically. Our analysis shows how
to cope with multiple randomness sources of initialization, label noise, and
data sampling (as well as stochastic gradients) with no closed-form solution,
and also goes beyond the commonly-used Gaussian/spherical data assumption. Our
theoretical results demonstrate that, with SGD training, RF regression still
generalizes well for interpolation learning, and is able to characterize the
double descent behavior by the unimodality of variance and monotonic decrease
of bias. Besides, we also prove that the constant step-size SGD setting incurs
no loss in convergence rate when compared to the exact minimal-norm
interpolator, as a theoretical justification of using SGD in practice.</span>

                    <span>Recently, it has been shown that natural language processing (NLP) models are
vulnerable to a kind of security threat called the Backdoor Attack, which
utilizes a &#x60;backdoor trigger&#x27; paradigm to mislead the models. The most
threatening backdoor attack is the stealthy backdoor, which defines the
triggers as text style or syntactic. Although they have achieved an incredible
high attack success rate (ASR), we find that the principal factor contributing
to their ASR is not the &#x60;backdoor trigger&#x27; paradigm. Thus the capacity of these
stealthy backdoor attacks is overestimated when categorized as backdoor
attacks. Therefore, to evaluate the real attack power of backdoor attacks, we
propose a new metric called attack successful rate difference (ASRD), which
measures the ASR difference between clean state and poison state models.
Besides, since the defenses against stealthy backdoor attacks are absent, we
propose Trigger Breaker, consisting of two too simple tricks that can defend
against stealthy backdoor attacks effectively. Experiments on text
classification tasks show that our method achieves significantly better
performance than state-of-the-art defense methods against stealthy backdoor
attacks.</span>

                    <span>We present CSWin Transformer, an efficient and effective Transformer-based
backbone for general-purpose vision tasks. A challenging issue in Transformer
design is that global self-attention is very expensive to compute whereas local
self-attention often limits the field of interactions of each token. To address
this issue, we develop the Cross-Shaped Window self-attention mechanism for
computing self-attention in the horizontal and vertical stripes in parallel
that form a cross-shaped window, with each stripe obtained by splitting the
input feature into stripes of equal width. We provide a mathematical analysis
of the effect of the stripe width and vary the stripe width for different
layers of the Transformer network which achieves strong modeling capability
while limiting the computation cost. We also introduce Locally-enhanced
Positional Encoding (LePE), which handles the local positional information
better than existing encoding schemes. LePE naturally supports arbitrary input
resolutions, and is thus especially effective and friendly for downstream
tasks. Incorporated with these designs and a hierarchical structure, CSWin
Transformer demonstrates competitive performance on common vision tasks.
Specifically, it achieves 85.4\% Top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1K without any
extra training data or label, 53.9 box AP and 46.4 mask AP on the COCO
detection task, and 52.2 mIOU on the ADE20K semantic segmentation task,

                    <span>This paper proposes a novel graph-based regularized regression estimator -
the hierarchical feature regression (HFR) -, which mobilizes insights from the
domains of machine learning and graph theory to estimate robust parameters for
a linear regression. The estimator constructs a supervised feature graph that
decomposes parameters along its edges, adjusting first for common variation and
successively incorporating idiosyncratic patterns into the fitting process. The
graph structure has the effect of shrinking parameters towards group targets,
where the extent of shrinkage is governed by a hyperparamter, and group
compositions as well as shrinkage targets are determined endogenously. The
method offers rich resources for the visual exploration of the latent effect
structure in the data, and demonstrates good predictive accuracy and
versatility when compared to a panel of commonly used regularization techniques
across a range of empirical and simulated regression tasks.</span>

                    <span>A major limitation of fuzzy or neuro-fuzzy systems is their failure to deal
with high-dimensional datasets. This happens primarily due to the use of
T-norm, particularly, product or minimum (or a softer version of it). Thus,
there are hardly any work dealing with datasets with dimensions more than
hundred or so. Here, we propose a neuro-fuzzy framework that can handle
datasets with dimensions even more than 7000! In this context, we propose an
adaptive softmin (Ada-softmin) which effectively overcomes the drawbacks of
&#x60;&#x60;numeric underflow&quot; and &#x60;&#x60;fake minimum&quot; that arise for existing fuzzy systems
while dealing with high-dimensional problems. We call it an Adaptive
Takagi-Sugeno-Kang (AdaTSK) fuzzy system. We then equip the AdaTSK system to
perform feature selection and rule extraction in an integrated manner. In this
context, a novel gate function is introduced and embedded only in the
consequent parts, which can determine the useful features and rules, in two
successive phases of learning. Unlike conventional fuzzy rule bases, we design
an enhanced fuzzy rule base (En-FRB), which maintains adequate rules but does
not grow the number of rules exponentially with dimension that typically
happens for fuzzy neural networks. The integrated Feature Selection and Rule
Extraction AdaTSK (FSRE-AdaTSK) system consists of three sequential phases: (i)
feature selection, (ii) rule extraction, and (iii) fine tuning. The
effectiveness of the FSRE-AdaTSK is demonstrated on 19 datasets of which five
are in more than 2000 dimension including two with dimension greater than 7000.
This may be the first time fuzzy systems are realized for classification
involving more than 7000 input features.</span>

                    <span>Some real-world decision-making problems require making probabilistic
forecasts over multiple steps at once. However, methods for probabilistic
forecasting may fail to capture correlations in the underlying time-series that
exist over long time horizons as errors accumulate. One such application is
with resource scheduling under uncertainty in a grid environment, which
requires forecasting electricity demand that is inherently noisy, but often
cyclic. In this paper, we introduce the conditional approximate normalizing
flow (CANF) to make probabilistic multi-step time-series forecasts when
correlations are present over long time horizons. We first demonstrate our
method&#x27;s efficacy on estimating the density of a toy distribution, finding that
CANF improves the KL divergence by one-third compared to that of a Gaussian
mixture model while still being amenable to explicit conditioning. We then use
a publicly available household electricity consumption dataset to showcase the
effectiveness of CANF on joint probabilistic multi-step forecasting. Empirical
results show that conditional approximate normalizing flows outperform other
methods in terms of multi-step forecast accuracy and lead to up to 10x better
scheduling decisions. Our implementation is available at

                    <span>Applying knowledge distillation to personalized cross-silo federated learning
can well alleviate the problem of user heterogeneity. This approach, however,
requires a proxy dataset, which is difficult to obtain in the real world.
Moreover, the global model based on parameter averaging will lead to the
leakage of user privacy. We introduce a distributed three-player GAN to
implement datafree co-distillation between clients. This technique mitigates
the user heterogeneity problem and better protects user privacy. We confirmed
that thefake samples generated by GAN can make federated distillation more
efficient and robust, and the co-distillation can achieve good performance for
individual clients on the basis of obtaining global knowledge. Our extensive
experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate the superior generalization

                    <span>The gap between simulation and the real-world restrains many machine learning
breakthroughs in computer vision and reinforcement learning from being
applicable in the real world. In this work, we tackle this gap for the specific
case of camera-based navigation, formulating it as following a visual cue in
the foreground with arbitrary backgrounds. The visual cue in the foreground can
often be simulated realistically, such as a line, gate or cone. The challenge
then lies in coping with the unknown backgrounds and integrating both. As such,
the goal is to train a visual agent on data captured in an empty simulated
environment except for this foreground cue and test this model directly in a
visually diverse real world. In order to bridge this big gap, we show it&#x27;s
crucial to combine following techniques namely: Randomized augmentation of the
fore- and background, regularization with both deep supervision and triplet
loss and finally abstraction of the dynamics by using waypoints rather than
direct velocity commands. The various techniques are ablated in our
experimental results both qualitatively and quantitatively finally
demonstrating a successful transfer from simulation to the real world.</span>

                    <span>A long-cherished vision in robotics is to equip robots with skills that match
the versatility and precision of humans. For example, when playing table
tennis, a robot should be capable of returning the ball in various ways while
precisely placing it at the desired location. A common approach to model such
versatile behavior is to use a Mixture of Experts (MoE) model, where each
expert is a contextual motion primitive. However, learning such MoEs is
challenging as most objectives force the model to cover the entire context
space, which prevents specialization of the primitives resulting in rather
low-quality components. Starting from maximum entropy reinforcement learning
(RL), we decompose the objective into optimizing an individual lower bound per
mixture component. Further, we introduce a curriculum by allowing the
components to focus on a local context region, enabling the model to learn
highly accurate skill representations. To this end, we use local context
distributions that are adapted jointly with the expert primitives. Our lower
bound advocates an iterative addition of new components, where new components
will concentrate on local context regions not covered by the current MoE. This
local and incremental learning results in a modular MoE model of high accuracy
and versatility, where both properties can be scaled by adding more components
on the fly. We demonstrate this by an extensive ablation and on two challenging
simulated robot skill learning tasks. We compare our achieved performance to
LaDiPS and HiREPS, a known hierarchical policy search method for learning
diverse skills.</span>

                    <span>Probabilistic model checking has been developed for verifying systems that
have stochastic and nondeterministic behavior. Given a probabilistic system, a
probabilistic model checker takes a property and checks whether or not the
property holds in that system. For this reason, probabilistic model checking
provide rigorous guarantees. So far, however, probabilistic model checking has
focused on propositional models where a state is represented by a symbol. On
the other hand, it is commonly required to make relational abstractions in
planning and reinforcement learning. Various frameworks handle relational
domains, for instance, STRIPS planning and relational Markov Decision
Processes. Using propositional model checking in relational settings requires
one to ground the model, which leads to the well known state explosion problem
and intractability. We present pCTL-REBEL, a lifted model checking approach for
verifying pCTL properties of relational MDPs. It extends REBEL, a relational
model-based reinforcement learning technique, toward relational pCTL model
checking. PCTL-REBEL is lifted, which means that rather than grounding, the
model exploits symmetries to reason about a group of objects as a whole at the
relational level. Theoretically, we show that pCTL model checking is decidable
for relational MDPs that have a possibly infinite domain, provided that the
states have a bounded size. Practically, we contribute algorithms and an
implementation of lifted relational model checking, and we show that the lifted
approach improves the scalability of the model checking approach.</span>

                    <span>Embedded systems demand on-device processing of data using Neural Networks
(NNs) while conforming to the memory, power and computation constraints,
leading to an efficiency and accuracy tradeoff. To bring NNs to edge devices,
several optimizations such as model compression through pruning, quantization,
and off-the-shelf architectures with efficient design have been extensively
adopted. These algorithms when deployed to real world sensitive applications,
requires to resist inference attacks to protect privacy of users training data.
However, resistance against inference attacks is not accounted for designing NN
models for IoT. In this work, we analyse the three-dimensional
privacy-accuracy-efficiency tradeoff in NNs for IoT devices and propose Gecko
training methodology where we explicitly add resistance to private inferences
as a design objective. We optimize the inference-time memory, computation, and
power constraints of embedded devices as a criterion for designing NN
architecture while also preserving privacy. We choose quantization as design
choice for highly efficient and private models. This choice is driven by the
observation that compressed models leak more information compared to baseline
models while off-the-shelf efficient architectures indicate poor efficiency and
privacy tradeoff. We show that models trained using Gecko methodology are
comparable to prior defences against black-box membership attacks in terms of
accuracy and privacy while providing efficiency.</span>

                    <span>Multi-armed bandits a simple but very powerful framework for algorithms that
make decisions over time under uncertainty. An enormous body of work has
accumulated over the years, covered in several books and surveys. This book
provides a more introductory, textbook-like treatment of the subject. Each
chapter tackles a particular line of work, providing a self-contained,
teachable technical introduction and a brief review of the further
developments; many of the chapters conclude with exercises.

The book is structured as follows. The first four chapters are on IID
rewards, from the basic model to impossibility results to Bayesian priors to
Lipschitz rewards. The next three chapters cover adversarial rewards, from the
full-feedback version to adversarial bandits to extensions with linear rewards
and combinatorially structured actions. Chapter 8 is on contextual bandits, a
middle ground between IID and adversarial bandits in which the change in reward
distributions is completely explained by observable contexts. The last three
chapters cover connections to economics, from learning in repeated games to
bandits with supply/budget constraints to exploration in the presence of
incentives. The appendix provides sufficient background on concentration and
KL-divergence.

The chapters on &quot;bandits with similarity information&quot;, &quot;bandits with
knapsacks&quot; and &quot;bandits and agents&quot; can also be consumed as standalone surveys
on the respective topics.</span>

                    <span>Spatial redundancy widely exists in visual recognition tasks, i.e.,
discriminative features in an image or video frame usually correspond to only a
subset of pixels, while the remaining regions are irrelevant to the task at
hand. Therefore, static models which process all the pixels with an equal
amount of computation result in considerable redundancy in terms of time and
space consumption. In this paper, we formulate the image recognition problem as
a sequential coarse-to-fine feature learning process, mimicking the human
visual system. Specifically, the proposed Glance and Focus Network (GFNet)
first extracts a quick global representation of the input image at a low
resolution scale, and then strategically attends to a series of salient (small)
regions to learn finer features. The sequential process naturally facilitates
adaptive inference at test time, as it can be terminated once the model is
sufficiently confident about its prediction, avoiding further redundant
computation. It is worth noting that the problem of locating discriminant
regions in our model is formulated as a reinforcement learning task, thus
requiring no additional manual annotations other than classification labels.
GFNet is general and flexible as it is compatible with any off-the-shelf
backbone models (such as MobileNets, EfficientNets and TSM), which can be
conveniently deployed as the feature extractor. Extensive experiments on a
variety of image classification and video recognition tasks and with various
backbone models demonstrate the remarkable efficiency of our method. For
example, it reduces the average latency of the highly efficient MobileNet-V3 on
an iPhone XS Max by 1.3x without sacrificing accuracy. Code and pre-trained
models are available at https://github.com/blackfeather-wang/GFNet-Pytorch.</span>

                    <span>Accurate drug response prediction (DRP) is a crucial yet challenging task in
precision medicine. This paper presents a novel Attention-Guided Multi-omics
Integration (AGMI) approach for DRP, which first constructs a Multi-edge Graph
(MeG) for each cell line, and then aggregates multi-omics features to predict
drug response using a novel structure, called Graph edge-aware Network (GeNet).
For the first time, our AGMI approach explores gene constraint based
multi-omics integration for DRP with the whole-genome using GNNs. Empirical
experiments on the CCLE and GDSC datasets show that our AGMI largely
outperforms state-of-the-art DRP methods by 8.3%--34.2% on four metrics. Our

                    <span>Federated learning is a popular technology for training machine learning
models on distributed data sources without sharing data. Vertical federated
learning or feature-based federated learning applies to the cases that
different data sources share the same sample ID space but differ in feature
space. To ensure the data owners&#x27; long-term engagement, it is critical to
objectively assess the contribution from each data source and recompense them
accordingly. The Shapley value (SV) is a provably fair contribution valuation
metric originated from cooperative game theory. However, computing the SV
requires extensively retraining the model on each subset of data sources, which
causes prohibitively high communication costs in federated learning. We propose
a contribution valuation metric called vertical federated Shapley value
(VerFedSV) based on SV. We show that VerFedSV not only satisfies many desirable
properties for fairness but is also efficient to compute, and can be adapted to
both synchronous and asynchronous vertical federated learning algorithms. Both
theoretical analysis and extensive experimental results verify the fairness,
efficiency, and adaptability of VerFedSV.</span>

                    <span>Automating information extraction from form-like documents at scale is a
pressing need due to its potential impact on automating business workflows
across many industries like financial services, insurance, and healthcare. The
key challenge is that form-like documents in these business workflows can be
laid out in virtually infinitely many ways; hence, a good solution to this
problem should generalize to documents with unseen layouts and languages. A
solution to this problem requires a holistic understanding of both the textual
segments and the visual cues within a document, which is non-trivial. While the
natural language processing and computer vision communities are starting to
tackle this problem, there has not been much focus on (1) data-efficiency, and
(2) ability to generalize across different document types and languages.

In this paper, we show that when we have only a small number of labeled
documents for training (~50), a straightforward transfer learning approach from
a considerably structurally-different larger labeled corpus yields up to a 27
F1 point improvement over simply training on the small corpus in the target
domain. We improve on this with a simple multi-domain transfer learning
approach, that is currently in production use, and show that this yields up to
a further 8 F1 point improvement. We make the case that data efficiency is
critical to enable information extraction systems to scale to handle hundreds
of different document-types, and learning good representations is critical to
accomplishing this.</span>

                    <span>In this paper, we propose a novel nonconvex approach to robust principal
component analysis for HSI denoising, which focuses on simultaneously
developing more accurate approximations to both rank and column-wise sparsity
for the low-rank and sparse components, respectively. In particular, the new
method adopts the log-determinant rank approximation and a novel
$\ell_{2,\log}$ norm, to restrict the local low-rank or column-wisely sparse
properties for the component matrices, respectively. For the
$\ell_{2,\log}$-regularized shrinkage problem, we develop an efficient,
closed-form solution, which is named $\ell_{2,\log}$-shrinkage operator. The
new regularization and the corresponding operator can be generally used in
other problems that require column-wise sparsity. Moreover, we impose the
spatial-spectral total variation regularization in the log-based nonconvex RPCA
model, which enhances the global piece-wise smoothness and spectral consistency
from the spatial and spectral views in the recovered HSI. Extensive experiments
on both simulated and real HSIs demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed
method in denoising HSIs.</span>

                    <span>Analysing electrocardiograms (ECGs) is an inexpensive and non-invasive, yet
powerful way to diagnose heart disease. ECG studies using Machine Learning to
automatically detect abnormal heartbeats so far depend on large, manually
annotated datasets. While collecting vast amounts of unlabeled data can be
straightforward, the point-by-point annotation of abnormal heartbeats is
tedious and expensive. We explore the use of multiple weak supervision sources
to learn diagnostic models of abnormal heartbeats via human designed
heuristics, without using ground truth labels on individual data points. Our
work is among the first to define weak supervision sources directly on time
series data. Results show that with as few as six intuitive time series
heuristics, we are able to infer high quality probabilistic label estimates for
over 100,000 heartbeats with little human effort, and use the estimated labels
to train competitive classifiers evaluated on held out test data.</span>

                    <span>A new approach called ABRF (the attention-based random forest) and its
modifications for applying the attention mechanism to the random forest (RF)
for regression and classification are proposed. The main idea behind the
proposed ABRF models is to assign attention weights with trainable parameters
to decision trees in a specific way. The weights depend on the distance between
an instance, which falls into a corresponding leaf of a tree, and instances,
which fall in the same leaf. This idea stems from representation of the
Nadaraya-Watson kernel regression in the form of a RF. Three modifications of
the general approach are proposed. The first one is based on applying the
Huber&#x27;s contamination model and on computing the attention weights by solving
quadratic or linear optimization problems. The second and the third
modifications use the gradient-based algorithms for computing trainable
parameters. Numerical experiments with various regression and classification
datasets illustrate the proposed method.</span>

                    <span>Poor sitting habits have been identified as a risk factor to musculoskeletal
disorders and lower back pain especially on the elderly, disabled people, and
office workers. In the current computerized world, even while involved in
leisure or work activity, people tend to spend most of their days sitting at
computer desks. This can result in spinal pain and related problems. Therefore,
a means to remind people about their sitting habits and provide recommendations
to counterbalance, such as physical exercise, is important. Posture recognition
for seated postures have not received enough attention as most works focus on
standing postures. Wearable sensors, pressure or force sensors, videos and
images were used for posture recognition in the literature. The aim of this
study is to build Machine Learning models for classifying sitting posture of a
person by analyzing data collected from a chair platted with two 32 by 32
pressure sensors at its seat and backrest. Models were built using five
algorithms: Random Forest (RF), Gaussian Na\&quot;ive Bayes, Logistic Regression,
Support Vector Machine and Deep Neural Network (DNN). All the models are
evaluated using KFold cross-validation technique. This paper presents
experiments conducted using the two separate datasets, controlled and
realistic, and discusses results achieved at classifying six sitting postures.
Average classification accuracies of 98% and 97% were achieved on the
controlled and realistic datasets, respectively.</span>

                    <span>Causal discovery between collections of time-series data can help diagnose
causes of symptoms and hopefully prevent faults before they occur. However,
reliable causal discovery can be very challenging, especially when the data
acquisition rate varies (i.e., non-uniform data sampling), or in the presence
of missing data points (e.g., sparse data sampling). To address these issues,
we proposed a new system comprised of two parts, the first part fills missing
data with a Gaussian Process Regression, and the second part leverages an Echo
State Network, which is a type of reservoir computer (i.e., used for chaotic
system modeling) for Causal discovery. We evaluate the performance of our
proposed system against three other off-the-shelf causal discovery algorithms,
namely, structural expectation-maximization, sub-sampled linear auto-regression
absolute coefficients, and multivariate Granger Causality with vector
auto-regressive using the Tennessee Eastman chemical dataset; we report on
their corresponding Matthews Correlation Coefficient(MCC) and Receiver
Operating Characteristic curves (ROC) and show that the proposed system
outperforms existing algorithms, demonstrating the viability of our approach to
discover causal relationships in a complex system with missing entries.</span>

                    <span>Reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) is an emerging technology for future
wireless communication systems. In this work, we consider downlink spatial
multiplexing enabled by the RIS for weighted sum-rate (WSR) maximization. In
the literature, most solutions use alternating gradient-based optimization,
which has moderate performance, high complexity, and limited scalability. We
propose to apply a fully convolutional network (FCN) to solve this problem,
which was originally designed for semantic segmentation of images. The
rectangular shape of the RIS and the spatial correlation of channels with
adjacent RIS antennas due to the short distance between them encourage us to
apply it for the RIS configuration. We design a set of channel features that
includes both cascaded channels via the RIS and the direct channel. In the base
station (BS), the differentiable minimum mean squared error (MMSE) precoder is
used for pretraining and the weighted minimum mean squared error (WMMSE)
precoder is then applied for fine-tuning, which is nondifferentiable, more
complex, but achieves a better performance. Evaluation results show that the
proposed solution has higher performance and allows for a faster evaluation
than the baselines. Hence it scales better to a large number of antennas,
advancing the RIS one step closer to practical deployment.</span>

environment have been addressed by proactively analyzing IT Service Desk
tickets, customer satisfaction surveys, and social media data. A Cognitive
solution goes beyond the traditional structured data analysis by deep analyses
of both structured and unstructured text. The salient features of the proposed
platform include language identification, translation, hierarchical extraction
of the most frequently occurring topics, entities and their relationships, text
summarization, sentiments, and knowledge extraction from the unstructured text
using Natural Language Processing techniques. Moreover, the insights from
unstructured text combined with structured data allow the development of
various classification, segmentation, and time-series forecasting use-cases on
the incident, problem, and change datasets. Further, the text and predictive
insights together with raw data are used for visualization and exploration of
actionable insights on a rich and interactive dashboard. However, it is hard
not only to find these insights using traditional structured data analysis but
it might also take a very long time to discover them, especially while dealing
with a massive amount of unstructured data. By taking action on these insights,
organizations can benefit from a significant reduction of ticket volume,
reduced operational costs, and increased customer satisfaction. In various
experiments, on average, upto 18-25% of yearly ticket volume has been reduced
using the proposed approach.</span>

their own businesses. Unlike humans, chatbots can serve multiple customers at a
time, are available 24/7 and reply in less than a fraction of a second. Though
chatbots perform well in task-oriented activities, in most cases they fail to
understand personalized opinions, statements or even queries which later impact
the organization for poor service management. Lack of understanding
capabilities in bots disinterest humans to continue conversations with them.
Usually, chatbots give absurd responses when they are unable to interpret a
user&#x27;s text accurately. Extracting the client reviews from conversations by
using chatbots, organizations can reduce the major gap of understanding between
the users and the chatbot and improve their quality of products and
services.Thus, in our research we incorporated all the key elements that are
necessary for a chatbot to analyse and understand an input text precisely and
accurately. We performed sentiment analysis, emotion detection, intent
classification and named-entity recognition using deep learning to develop
chatbots with humanistic understanding and intelligence. The efficiency of our
approach can be demonstrated accordingly by the detailed analysis.</span>

unconditional GAN into a conditional GAN using labeled data. We first identify
and analyze three approaches to this problem -- conditional GAN training from
scratch, fine-tuning, and input reprogramming. Our analysis reveals that when
the amount of labeled data is small, input reprogramming performs the best.
Motivated by real-world scenarios with scarce labeled data, we focus on the
input reprogramming approach and carefully analyze the existing algorithm.
After identifying a few critical issues of the previous input reprogramming
approach, we propose a new algorithm called InRep+. Our algorithm InRep+
addresses the existing issues with the novel uses of invertible neural networks
and Positive-Unlabeled (PU) learning. Via extensive experiments, we show that
InRep+ outperforms all existing methods, particularly when label information is
scarce, noisy, and/or imbalanced. For instance, for the task of conditioning a
CIFAR10 GAN with 1% labeled data, InRep+ achieves an average Intra-FID of

                    <span>Convolution has been the core operation of modern deep neural networks. It is
well-known that convolutions can be implemented in the Fourier Transform
domain. In this paper, we propose to use binary block Walsh-Hadamard transform
(WHT) instead of the Fourier transform. We use WHT-based binary layers to
replace some of the regular convolution layers in deep neural networks. We
utilize both one-dimensional (1-D) and two-dimensional (2-D) binary WHTs in
this paper. In both 1-D and 2-D layers, we compute the binary WHT of the input
feature map and denoise the WHT domain coefficients using a nonlinearity which
is obtained by combining soft-thresholding with the tanh function. After
denoising, we compute the inverse WHT. We use 1D-WHT to replace the $1\times 1$
convolutional layers, and 2D-WHT layers can replace the 3$\times$3 convolution
layers and Squeeze-and-Excite layers. 2D-WHT layers with trainable weights can
be also inserted before the Global Average Pooling (GAP) layers to assist the
dense layers. In this way, we can reduce the number of trainable parameters
significantly with a slight decrease in trainable parameters. In this paper, we
implement the WHT layers into MobileNet-V2, MobileNet-V3-Large, and ResNet to
reduce the number of parameters significantly with negligible accuracy loss.
Moreover, according to our speed test, the 2D-FWHT layer runs about 24 times as
fast as the regular $3\times 3$ convolution with 19.51\% less RAM usage in an
NVIDIA Jetson Nano experiment.</span>

                    <span>The model-based reinforcement learning paradigm, which uses planning
algorithms and neural network models, has recently achieved unprecedented
results in diverse applications, leading to what is now known as deep
reinforcement learning. These agents are quite complex and involve multiple
components, factors that can create challenges for research. In this work, we
propose a new modular software architecture suited for these types of agents,
and a set of building blocks that can be easily reused and assembled to
construct new model-based reinforcement learning agents. These building blocks
include planning algorithms, policies, and loss functions.

We illustrate the use of this architecture by combining several of these
building blocks to implement and test agents that are optimized to three
different test environments: Cartpole, Minigrid, and Tictactoe. One particular
planning algorithm, made available in our implementation and not previously
used in reinforcement learning, which we called averaged minimax, achieved good
results in the three tested environments.

Experiments performed with this architecture have shown that the best
combination of planning algorithm, policy, and loss function is heavily problem
dependent. This result provides evidence that the proposed architecture, which
is modular and reusable, is useful for reinforcement learning researchers who
want to study new environments and techniques.</span>

samples as one of the known classes from training or &quot;unknown.&quot; As novel cancer
drug cocktails with improved treatment are continually discovered, predicting
cancer treatments can naturally be formulated in terms of an open-set
recognition problem. Drawbacks, due to modeling unknown samples during
training, arise from straightforward implementations of prior work in
healthcare open-set learning. Accordingly, we reframe the problem methodology
and apply a recent existing Gaussian mixture variational autoencoder model,

                    <span>Motivated by potential financial gain, companies may hire fraudster groups to
write fake reviews to either demote competitors or promote their own
businesses. Such groups are considerably more successful in misleading
customers, as people are more likely to be influenced by the opinion of a large
group. To detect such groups, a common model is to represent fraudster groups&#x27;
static networks, consequently overlooking the longitudinal behavior of a
reviewer thus the dynamics of co-review relations among reviewers in a group.
Hence, these approaches are incapable of excluding outlier reviewers, which are
fraudsters intentionally camouflaging themselves in a group and genuine
reviewers happen to co-review in fraudster groups. To address this issue, in
this work, we propose to first capitalize on the effectiveness of the HIN-RNN
in both reviewers&#x27; representation learning while capturing the collaboration
between reviewers, we first utilize the HIN-RNN to model the co-review
relations of reviewers in a group in a fixed time window of 28 days. We refer
to this as spatial relation learning representation to signify the
generalisability of this work to other networked scenarios. Then we use an RNN
on the spatial relations to predict the spatio-temporal relations of reviewers
in the group. In the third step, a Graph Convolution Network (GCN) refines the
reviewers&#x27; vector representations using these predicted relations. These
refined representations are then used to remove outlier reviewers. The average
of the remaining reviewers&#x27; representation is then fed to a simple fully
connected layer to predict if the group is a fraudster group or not. Exhaustive
experiments of the proposed approach showed a 5% (4%), 12% (5%), 12% (5%)
improvement over three of the most recent approaches on precision, recall, and
F1-value over the Yelp (Amazon) dataset, respectively.</span>

                    <span>The mathematical forces at work behind Generative Adversarial Networks raise
challenging theoretical issues. Motivated by the important question of
characterizing the geometrical properties of the generated distributions, we
provide a thorough analysis of Wasserstein GANs (WGANs) in both the finite
sample and asymptotic regimes. We study the specific case where the latent
space is univariate and derive results valid regardless of the dimension of the
output space. We show in particular that for a fixed sample size, the optimal
WGANs are closely linked with connected paths minimizing the sum of the squared
Euclidean distances between the sample points. We also highlight the fact that
WGANs are able to approach (for the 1-Wasserstein distance) the target
distribution as the sample size tends to infinity, at a given convergence rate
and provided the family of generative Lipschitz functions grows appropriately.
We derive in passing new results on optimal transport theory in the
semi-discrete setting.</span>

                    <span>Vertical collaborative learning system also known as vertical federated
learning (VFL) system has recently become prominent as a concept to process
data distributed across many individual sources without the need to centralize
it. Multiple participants collaboratively train models based on their local
data in a privacy-preserving manner. To date, VFL has become a de facto
solution to securely learn a model among organizations, allowing knowledge to
be shared without compromising privacy of any individual organizations.

Despite the prosperous development of VFL systems, we find that certain
inputs of a participant, named adversarial dominating inputs (ADIs), can
dominate the joint inference towards the direction of the adversary&#x27;s will and
force other (victim) participants to make negligible contributions, losing
rewards that are usually offered regarding the importance of their
contributions in collaborative learning scenarios.

We conduct a systematic study on ADIs by first proving their existence in
typical VFL systems. We then propose gradient-based methods to synthesize ADIs
of various formats and exploit common VFL systems. We further launch greybox
fuzz testing, guided by the resiliency score of &quot;victim&quot; participants, to
perturb adversary-controlled inputs and systematically explore the VFL attack
surface in a privacy-preserving manner. We conduct an in-depth study on the
influence of critical parameters and settings in synthesizing ADIs. Our study
reveals new VFL attack opportunities, promoting the identification of unknown
threats before breaches and building more secure VFL systems.</span>

                    <span>Standard deep learning algorithms are implemented using floating-point real
numbers. This presents an obstacle for implementing them on low-end devices
which may not have dedicated floating-point units (FPUs). As a result,
researchers in TinyML have considered machine learning algorithms that can
train and run a deep neural network (DNN) on a low-end device using integer
operations only. In this paper we propose PocketNN, a light and self-contained
proof-of-concept framework in pure C++ for the training and inference of DNNs
using only integers. Unlike other approaches, PocketNN directly operates on
integers without requiring any explicit quantization algorithms or customized
fixed-point formats. This was made possible by pocket activations, which are a
family of activation functions devised for integer-only DNNs, and an emerging
DNN training algorithm called direct feedback alignment (DFA). Unlike the
standard backpropagation (BP), DFA trains each layer independently, thus
avoiding integer overflow which is a key problem when using BP with
integer-only operations. We used PocketNN to train some DNNs on two well-known
datasets, MNIST and Fashion-MNIST. Our experiments show that the DNNs trained
with our PocketNN achieved 96.98% and 87.7% accuracies on MNIST and
Fashion-MNIST datasets, respectively. The accuracies are very close to the
equivalent DNNs trained using BP with floating-point real number operations,
such that accuracy degradations were just 1.02%p and 2.09%p, respectively.
Finally, our PocketNN has high compatibility and portability for low-end
devices as it is open source and implemented in pure C++ without any
dependencies.</span>

                    <span>A significant bottleneck in federated learning is the network communication
cost of sending model updates from client devices to the central server. We
propose a method to reduce this cost. Our method encodes quantized updates with
an appropriate universal code, taking into account their empirical
distribution. Because quantization introduces error, we select quantization
levels by optimizing for the desired trade-off in average total bitrate and
gradient distortion. We demonstrate empirically that in spite of the non-i.i.d.
nature of federated learning, the rate-distortion frontier is consistent across
datasets, optimizers, clients and training rounds, and within each setting,
distortion reliably predicts model performance. This allows for a remarkably
simple compression scheme that is near-optimal in many use cases, and
outperforms Top-K, DRIVE, 3LC and QSGD on the Stack Overflow next-word
prediction benchmark.</span>

                    <span>Recent breakthroughs in high resolution imaging of biomolecules in solution
with cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) have unlocked new doors for the
reconstruction of molecular volumes, thereby promising further advances in
biology, chemistry, and pharmacological research amongst others. Despite
significant headway, the immense challenges in cryo-EM data analysis remain
legion and intricately inter-disciplinary in nature, requiring insights from
physicists, structural biologists, computer scientists, statisticians, and
applied mathematicians. Meanwhile, recent next-generation volume reconstruction
algorithms that combine generative modeling with end-to-end unsupervised deep
learning techniques have shown promising results on simulated data, but still
face considerable hurdles when applied to experimental cryo-EM images. In light
of the proliferation of such methods and given the interdisciplinary nature of
the task, we propose here a critical review of recent advances in the field of
deep generative modeling for high resolution cryo-EM volume reconstruction. The
present review aims to (i) compare and contrast these new methods, while (ii)
presenting them from a perspective and using terminology familiar to scientists
in each of the five aforementioned fields with no specific background in
cryo-EM. The review begins with an introduction to the mathematical and
computational challenges of deep generative models for cryo-EM volume
reconstruction, along with an overview of the baseline methodology shared
across this class of algorithms. Having established the common thread weaving
through these different models, we provide a practical comparison of these
state-of-the-art algorithms, highlighting their relative strengths and
weaknesses, along with the assumptions that they rely on. This allows us to
identify bottlenecks in current methods and avenues for future research.</span>

                    <span>Knowledge graphs (KGs) are typically incomplete and we often wish to infer
new facts given the existing ones. This can be thought of as a binary
classification problem; we aim to predict if new facts are true or false.
Unfortunately, we generally only have positive examples (the known facts) but
we also need negative ones to train a classifier. To resolve this, it is usual
to generate negative examples using a negative sampling strategy. However, this
can produce false negatives which may reduce performance, is computationally
expensive, and does not produce calibrated classification probabilities. In
this paper, we propose a training procedure that obviates the need for negative
sampling by adding a novel regularization term to the loss function. Our
results for two relational embedding models (DistMult and SimplE) show the
merit of our proposal both in terms of performance and speed.</span>

                    <span>E-commerce product pages on the web often present product specification data
in structured tabular blocks. Extraction of these product attribute-value
specifications has benefited applications like product catalogue curation,
search, question answering, and others. However, across different Websites,
there is a wide variety of HTML elements (like 
, 
, 
, ,
 etc.) typically used to render these blocks that makes their automatic
extraction a challenge. Most of the current research has focused on extracting
product specifications from tables and lists and, therefore, suffers from
recall when applied to a large-scale extraction setting. In this paper, we
present a product specification extraction approach that goes beyond tables or
lists and generalizes across the diverse HTML elements used for rendering
specification blocks. Using a combination of hand-coded features and deep
learned spatial and token features, we first identify the specification blocks
on a product page. We then extract the product attribute-value pairs from these
blocks following an approach inspired by wrapper induction. We created a
labeled dataset of product specifications extracted from 14,111 diverse
specification blocks taken from a range of different product websites. Our
experiments show the efficacy of our approach compared to the current
specification extraction models and support our claim about its application to
large-scale product specification extraction.</span>

                    <span>Recently, the applications of deep neural network (DNN) have been very
prominent in many fields such as computer vision (CV) and natural language
processing (NLP) due to its superior feature extraction performance. However,
the high-dimension parameter model and large-scale mathematical calculation
restrict the execution efficiency, especially for Internet of Things (IoT)
devices. Different from the previous cloud/edge-only pattern that brings huge
pressure for uplink communication and device-only fashion that undertakes
unaffordable calculation strength, we highlight the collaborative computation
between the device and edge for DNN models, which can achieve a good balance
between the communication load and execution accuracy. Specifically, a
systematic on-demand co-inference framework is proposed to exploit the
multi-branch structure, in which the pre-trained Alexnet is right-sized through
\emph{early-exit} and partitioned at an intermediate DNN layer. The integer
quantization is enforced to further compress transmission bits. As a result, we
establish a new Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) optimizer-Soft Actor Critic
for discrete (SAC-d), which generates the \emph{exit point}, \emph{partition
point}, and \emph{compressing bits} by soft policy iterations. Based on the
latency and accuracy aware reward design, such an optimizer can well adapt to
the complex environment like dynamic wireless channel and arbitrary CPU
processing, and is capable of supporting the 5G URLLC. Real-world experiment on
Raspberry Pi 4 and PC shows the outperformance of the proposed solution.</span>

                    <span>Federated learning (FL) provides a high efficient decentralized machine
learning framework, where the training data remains distributed at remote
clients in a network. Though FL enables a privacy-preserving mobile edge
computing framework using IoT devices, recent studies have shown that this
approach is susceptible to poisoning attacks from the side of remote clients.
To address the poisoning attacks on FL, we provide a \textit{two-phase} defense
algorithm called {Lo}cal {Ma}licious Facto{r} (LoMar). In phase I, LoMar scores
model updates from each remote client by measuring the relative distribution
over their neighbors using a kernel density estimation method. In phase II, an
optimal threshold is approximated to distinguish malicious and clean updates
from a statistical perspective. Comprehensive experiments on four real-world
datasets have been conducted, and the experimental results show that our
defense strategy can effectively protect the FL system. {Specifically, the
defense performance on Amazon dataset under a label-flipping attack indicates
that, compared with FG+Krum, LoMar increases the target label testing accuracy
from $96.0\%$ to $98.8\%$, and the overall averaged testing accuracy from
$90.1\%$ to $97.0\%$.</span>

analysis of deep linear networks. Specifically, we consider optimizing deep
linear networks which have a layer with one neuron under quadratic loss. We
describe the convergent point of trajectories with arbitrary starting point
under gradient flow, including the paths which converge to one of the saddle
points or the original point. We also show specific convergence rates of
trajectories that converge to the global minimizer by stages. To achieve these
results, this paper mainly extends the machinery in Eftekhari&#x27;s work to
provably identify the rank-stable set and the global minimizer convergent set.
We also give specific examples to show the necessity of our definitions.
Crucially, as far as we know, our results appear to be the first to give a
non-local global analysis of linear neural networks from arbitrary initialized
points, rather than the lazy training regime which has dominated the literature
of neural networks, and restricted benign initialization in Eftekhari&#x27;s work.

                    <span>Although mission-critical applications require the use of deep neural
networks (DNNs), their continuous execution at mobile devices results in a
significant increase in energy consumption. While edge offloading can decrease
energy consumption, erratic patterns in channel quality, network and edge
server load can lead to severe disruption of the system&#x27;s key operations. An
alternative approach, called split computing, generates compressed
representations within the model (called &quot;bottlenecks&quot;), to reduce bandwidth
usage and energy consumption. Prior work has proposed approaches that introduce
additional layers, to the detriment of energy consumption and latency. For this
reason, we propose a new framework called BottleFit, which, in addition to
targeted DNN architecture modifications, includes a novel training strategy to
achieve high accuracy even with strong compression rates. We apply BottleFit on
cutting-edge DNN models in image classification, and show that BottleFit
achieves 77.1% data compression with up to 0.6% accuracy loss on ImageNet
dataset, while state of the art such as SPINN loses up to 6% in accuracy. We
experimentally measure the power consumption and latency of an image
classification application running on an NVIDIA Jetson Nano board (GPU-based)
and a Raspberry PI board (GPU-less). We show that BottleFit decreases power
consumption and latency respectively by up to 49% and 89% with respect to
(w.r.t.) local computing and by 37% and 55% w.r.t. edge offloading. We also
compare BottleFit with state-of-the-art autoencoders-based approaches, and show
that (i) BottleFit reduces power consumption and execution time respectively by
up to 54% and 44% on the Jetson and 40% and 62% on Raspberry PI; (ii) the size

                    <span>Attention-based deep networks have been successfully applied on textual data
in the field of NLP. However, their application on protein sequences poses
additional challenges due to the weak semantics of the protein words, unlike
the plain text words. These unexplored challenges faced by the standard
attention technique include (i) vanishing attention score problem and (ii) high
variations in the attention distribution. In this regard, we introduce a novel
{\lambda}-scaled attention technique for fast and efficient modeling of the
protein sequences that addresses both the above problems. This is used to
develop the {\lambda}-scaled attention network and is evaluated for the task of
protein function prediction implemented at the protein sub-sequence level.
Experiments on the datasets for biological process (BP) and molecular function
(MF) showed significant improvements in the F1 score values for the proposed
{\lambda}-scaled attention technique over its counterpart approach based on the
standard attention technique (+2.01% for BP and +4.67% for MF) and
state-of-the-art ProtVecGen-Plus approach (+2.61% for BP and +4.20% for MF).
Further, fast convergence (converging in half the number of epochs) and
efficient learning (in terms of very low difference between the training and
validation losses) were also observed during the training process.</span>

                    <span>We consider the general problem of online convex optimization with
time-varying additive constraints in the presence of predictions for the next
cost and constraint functions. A novel primal-dual algorithm is designed by
combining a Follow-The-Regularized-Leader iteration with prediction-adaptive
dynamic steps. The algorithm achieves $\mathcal O(T^{\frac{3-\beta}{4}})$
regret and $\mathcal O(T^{\frac{1+\beta}{2}})$ constraint violation bounds that
are tunable via parameter $\beta\!\in\![1/2,1)$ and have constant factors that
shrink with the predictions quality, achieving eventually $\mathcal O(1)$
regret for perfect predictions. Our work extends the FTRL framework for this
constrained OCO setting and outperforms the respective state-of-the-art
greedy-based solutions, without imposing conditions on the quality of
predictions, the cost functions or the geometry of constraints, beyond
convexity.</span>

                    <span>Federated learning (FL) is a training technique that enables client devices
to jointly learn a shared model by aggregating locally-computed models without
exposing their raw data. While most of the existing work focuses on improving
the FL model accuracy, in this paper, we focus on the improving the training
efficiency, which is often a hurdle for adopting FL in real-world applications.
Specifically, we design an efficient FL framework which jointly optimizes model
accuracy, processing latency and communication efficiency, all of which are
primary design considerations for real implementation of FL. Inspired by the
recent success of Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) in solving complex
control problems, we present \textit{FedMarl}, an MARL-based FL framework which
performs efficient run-time client selection. Experiments show that FedMarl can
significantly improve model accuracy with much lower processing latency and

                    <span>Sepsis is a life-threatening medical emergency, which is a major cause of
death worldwide and the second highest cause of mortality in the United States.
Researching the optimal control treatment or intervention strategy on the
comprehensive sepsis system is key in reducing mortality. For this purpose,
first, this paper improves a complex nonlinear sepsis model proposed in our
previous work. Then, bifurcation analyses are conducted for each sepsis
subsystem to study the model behaviors under some system parameters. The
bifurcation analysis results also further indicate the necessity of control
treatment and intervention therapy. If the sepsis system is without adding any
control under some parameter and initial system value settings, the system will
perform persistent inflammation outcomes as time goes by. Therefore, we develop
our complex improved nonlinear sepsis model into a sepsis optimal control
model, and then use some effective biomarkers recommended in existing clinic
practices as optimization objective function to measure the development of
sepsis. Besides that, a Bayesian optimization algorithm by combining Recurrent
neural network (RNN-BO algorithm) is introduced to predict the optimal control
strategy for the studied sepsis optimal control system. The difference between
the RNN-BO algorithm from other optimization algorithms is that once given any
new initial system value setting (initial value is associated with the initial
conditions of patients), the RNN-BO algorithm is capable of quickly predicting
a corresponding time-series optimal control based on the historical optimal
control data for any new sepsis patient. To demonstrate the effectiveness and
efficiency of the RNN-BO algorithm on solving the optimal control solution on
the complex nonlinear sepsis system, some numerical simulations are implemented
by comparing with other optimization algorithms in this paper.</span>

                    <span>Transit spectroscopy is a powerful tool to decode the chemical composition of
the atmospheres of extrasolar planets. In this paper we focus on unsupervised
techniques for analyzing spectral data from transiting exoplanets. We
demonstrate methods for i) cleaning and validating the data, ii) initial
exploratory data analysis based on summary statistics (estimates of location
and variability), iii) exploring and quantifying the existing correlations in
the data, iv) pre-processing and linearly transforming the data to its
principal components, v) dimensionality reduction and manifold learning, vi)
clustering and anomaly detection, vii) visualization and interpretation of the
data. To illustrate the proposed unsupervised methodology, we use a well-known
public benchmark data set of synthetic transit spectra. We show that there is a
high degree of correlation in the spectral data, which calls for appropriate
low-dimensional representations. We explore a number of different techniques
for such dimensionality reduction and identify several suitable options in
terms of summary statistics, principal components, etc. We uncover interesting
structures in the principal component basis, namely, well-defined branches
corresponding to different chemical regimes of the underlying atmospheres. We
demonstrate that those branches can be successfully recovered with a K-means
clustering algorithm in fully unsupervised fashion. We advocate for a
three-dimensional representation of the spectroscopic data in terms of the
first three principal components, in order to reveal the existing structure in
the data and quickly characterize the chemical class of a planet.</span>

                    <span>Instead of using current deep-learning segmentation models (like the UNet and
variants), we approach the segmentation problem using trained Convolutional
Neural Network (CNN) classifiers, which automatically extract important
features from classified targets for image classification. Those extracted
features can be visualized and formed heatmaps using Gradient-weighted Class
Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM). This study tested whether the heatmaps could be
used to segment the classified targets. We also proposed an evaluation method
for the heatmaps; that is, to re-train the CNN classifier using images filtered
by heatmaps and examine its performance. We used the mean-Dice coefficient to
evaluate segmentation results. Results from our experiments show that heatmaps
can locate and segment partial tumor areas. But only use of the heatmaps from
CNN classifiers may not be an optimal approach for segmentation. In addition,
we have verified that the predictions of CNN classifiers mainly depend on tumor
areas, and dark regions in Grad-CAM&#x27;s heatmaps also contribute to
classification.</span>

which is one of the few closed form algorithms for the subspace clustering
problem. Despite being simple, closed-form, and computation-efficient, MFC can
outperform the other sophisticated subspace clustering methods in many
challenging scenarios. We reveal the connection between MFC and the Innovation
Pursuit (iPursuit) algorithm which was shown to be able to outperform the other
spectral clustering based methods with a notable margin especially when the
span of clusters are close. A novel theoretical study is presented which sheds
light on the key performance factors of both algorithms (MFC/iPursuit) and it
is shown that both algorithms can be robust to notable intersections between
the span of clusters. Importantly, in contrast to the theoretical guarantees of
other algorithms which emphasized on the distance between the subspaces as the
key performance factor and without making the innovation assumption, it is
shown that the performance of MFC/iPursuit mainly depends on the distance
between the innovative components of the clusters.</span>

                    <span>Modeling heterogeneity by extraction and exploitation of high-order
information from heterogeneous information networks (HINs) has been attracting
immense research attention in recent times. Such heterogeneous network
embedding (HNE) methods effectively harness the heterogeneity of small-scale
HINs. However, in the real world, the size of HINs grow exponentially with the
continuous introduction of new nodes and different types of links, making it a
billion-scale network. Learning node embeddings on such HINs creates a
performance bottleneck for existing HNE methods that are commonly centralized,
i.e., complete data and the model are both on a single machine. To address
large-scale HNE tasks with strong efficiency and effectiveness guarantee, we
present \textit{Decentralized Embedding Framework for Heterogeneous Information
Network} (DeHIN) in this paper. In DeHIN, we generate a distributed parallel
pipeline that utilizes hypergraphs in order to infuse parallelization into the
HNE task. DeHIN presents a context preserving partition mechanism that
innovatively formulates a large HIN as a hypergraph, whose hyperedges connect
semantically similar nodes. Our framework then adopts a decentralized strategy
to efficiently partition HINs by adopting a tree-like pipeline. Then, each
resulting subnetwork is assigned to a distributed worker, which employs the
deep information maximization theorem to locally learn node embeddings from the
partition it receives. We further devise a novel embedding alignment scheme to
precisely project independently learned node embeddings from all subnetworks
onto a common vector space, thus allowing for downstream tasks like link
prediction and node classification.</span>

                    <span>Graph embedding techniques have led to significant progress in recent years.
However, present techniques are not effective enough to capture the patterns of
networks. This paper propose neighbor2vec, a neighbor-based sampling strategy
used algorithm to learn the neighborhood representations of node, a framework
to gather the structure information by feature propagation between the node and
its neighbors. We claim that neighbor2vec is a simple and effective approach to
enhancing the scalability as well as equality of graph embedding, and it breaks
the limits of the existing state-of-the-art unsupervised techniques. We conduct
experiments on several node classification and link prediction tasks for
networks such as ogbn-arxiv, ogbn-products, ogbn-proteins, ogbl-ppa,ogbl-collab
and ogbl-citation2. The result shows that Neighbor2vec&#x27;s representations
provide an average accuracy scores up to 6.8 percent higher than competing
methods in node classification tasks and 3.0 percent higher in link prediction
tasks. The neighbor2vec&#x27;s representations are able to outperform all baseline
methods and two classical GNN models in all six experiments.</span>

                    <span>Temporal abstraction in reinforcement learning is the ability of an agent to
learn and use high-level behaviors, called options. The option-critic
architecture provides a gradient-based end-to-end learning method to construct
options. We propose an attention-based extension to this framework, which
enables the agent to learn to focus different options on different aspects of
the observation space. We show that this leads to behaviorally diverse options
which are also capable of state abstraction, and prevents the degeneracy
problems of option domination and frequent option switching that occur in
option-critic, while achieving a similar sample complexity. We also demonstrate
the more efficient, interpretable, and reusable nature of the learned options
in comparison with option-critic, through different transfer learning tasks.
Experimental results in a relatively simple four-rooms environment and the more
complex ALE (Arcade Learning Environment) showcase the efficacy of our
approach.</span>

                    <span>In a modern power system, real-time data on power generation/consumption and
its relevant features are stored in various distributed parties, including
household meters, transformer stations and external organizations. To fully
exploit the underlying patterns of these distributed data for accurate power
prediction, federated learning is needed as a collaborative but
privacy-preserving training scheme. However, current federated learning
frameworks are polarized towards addressing either the horizontal or vertical
separation of data, and tend to overlook the case where both are present.
Furthermore, in mainstream horizontal federated learning frameworks, only
artificial neural networks are employed to learn the data patterns, which are
considered less accurate and interpretable compared to tree-based models on
tabular datasets. To this end, we propose a hybrid federated learning framework
based on XGBoost, for distributed power prediction from real-time external
features. In addition to introducing boosted trees to improve accuracy and
interpretability, we combine horizontal and vertical federated learning, to
address the scenario where features are scattered in local heterogeneous
parties and samples are scattered in various local districts. Moreover, we
design a dynamic task allocation scheme such that each party gets a fair share
of information, and the computing power of each party can be fully leveraged to
boost training efficiency. A follow-up case study is presented to justify the
necessity of adopting the proposed framework. The advantages of the proposed
framework in fairness, efficiency and accuracy performance are also confirmed.</span>

                    <span>UAV-based image retrieval in modern agriculture enables gathering large
amounts of spatially referenced crop image data. In large-scale experiments,
however, UAV images suffer from containing a multitudinous amount of crops in a
complex canopy architecture. Especially for the observation of temporal
effects, this complicates the recognition of individual plants over several
images and the extraction of relevant information tremendously. In this work,
we present a hands-on workflow for the automatized temporal and spatial
identification and individualization of crop images from UAVs abbreviated as
&quot;cataloging&quot; based on comprehensible computer vision methods. We evaluate the
workflow on two real-world datasets. One dataset is recorded for observation of
Cercospora leaf spot - a fungal disease - in sugar beet over an entire growing
cycle. The other one deals with harvest prediction of cauliflower plants. The
plant catalog is utilized for the extraction of single plant images seen over
multiple time points. This gathers large-scale spatio-temporal image dataset
that in turn can be applied to train further machine learning models including
various data layers. The presented approach improves analysis and
interpretation of UAV data in agriculture significantly. By validation with
some reference data, our method shows an accuracy that is similar to more
complex deep learning-based recognition techniques. Our workflow is able to
automatize plant cataloging and training image extraction, especially for large
datasets.</span>

surveil. There have been many studies focusing on fall detection. However, from
our survey, there is still no research indicating the prior-fall activities,
which we believe that they have a strong correlation with the intensity of the
fall. The purpose of this research is to develop a fall alert system that also
identifies prior-fall activities. First, we want to find a suitable location to
attach a sensor to the body. We created multiple-spot on-body devices to
collect various activity data. We used that dataset to train 5 different
classification models. We selected the XGBoost classification model for
detecting a prior-fall activity and the chest location for use in fall
detection from a comparison of the detection accuracy. We then tested 3
existing fall detection threshold algorithms to detect fall and fall to their
knees first, and selected the 3-phase threshold algorithm of Chaitep and
Chawachat [3] in our system. From the experiment, we found that the fall
detection accuracy is 88.91%, the fall to their knees first detection accuracy
is 91.25%, and the average accuracy of detection of prior-fall activities is
86.25%. Although we use an activity dataset of young to middle-aged adults
(18-49 years), we are confident that this system can be developed to monitor
activities before the fall, especially in the elderly, so that caretakers can
better manage the situation.</span>

                    <span>We study what dataset assumption permits solving offline two-player zero-sum
Markov game. In stark contrast to the offline single-agent Markov decision
process, we show that the single strategy concentration assumption is
insufficient for learning the Nash equilibrium (NE) strategy in offline
two-player zero-sum Markov games. On the other hand, we propose a new
assumption named unilateral concentration and design a pessimism-type algorithm
that is provably efficient under this assumption. In addition, we show that the
unilateral concentration assumption is necessary for learning an NE strategy.
Furthermore, our algorithm can achieve minimax sample complexity without any
modification for two widely studied settings: dataset with uniform
concentration assumption and turn-based Markov game. Our work serves as an
important initial step towards understanding offline multi-agent reinforcement
learning.</span>

                    <span>Spectral analysis is a powerful tool, decomposing any function into simpler
parts. In machine learning, Mercer&#x27;s theorem generalizes this idea, providing
for any kernel and input distribution a natural basis of functions of
increasing frequency. More recently, several works have extended this analysis
to deep neural networks through the framework of Neural Tangent Kernel. In this
work, we analyze the layer-wise spectral bias of Deep Neural Networks and
relate it to the contributions of different layers in the reduction of
generalization error for a given target function. We utilize the properties of
Hermite polynomials and Spherical Harmonics to prove that initial layers
exhibit a larger bias towards high-frequency functions defined on the unit
sphere. We further provide empirical results validating our theory in high
dimensional datasets for Deep Neural Networks.</span>

                    <span>This paper studies the problem of learning causal structures from
observational data. We reformulate the Structural Equation Model (SEM) with
additive noises in a form parameterized by binary graph adjacency matrix and
show that, if the original SEM is identifiable, then the binary adjacency
matrix can be identified up to super-graphs of the true causal graph under mild
conditions. We then utilize the reformulated SEM to develop a causal structure
learning method that can be efficiently trained using gradient-based
optimization, by leveraging a smooth characterization on acyclicity and the
Gumbel-Softmax approach to approximate the binary adjacency matrix. It is found
that the obtained entries are typically near zero or one and can be easily
thresholded to identify the edges. We conduct experiments on synthetic and real
datasets to validate the effectiveness of the proposed method, and show that it
readily includes different smooth model functions and achieves a much improved
performance on most datasets considered.</span>

                    <span>This paper studies generalization properties of random features (RF)
regression in high dimensions optimized by stochastic gradient descent (SGD).
In this regime, we derive precise non-asymptotic error bounds of RF regression
under both constant and adaptive step-size SGD setting, and observe the double
descent phenomenon both theoretically and empirically. Our analysis shows how
to cope with multiple randomness sources of initialization, label noise, and
data sampling (as well as stochastic gradients) with no closed-form solution,
and also goes beyond the commonly-used Gaussian/spherical data assumption. Our
theoretical results demonstrate that, with SGD training, RF regression still
generalizes well for interpolation learning, and is able to characterize the
double descent behavior by the unimodality of variance and monotonic decrease
of bias. Besides, we also prove that the constant step-size SGD setting incurs
no loss in convergence rate when compared to the exact minimal-norm
interpolator, as a theoretical justification of using SGD in practice.</span>

                    <span>In this paper, we study the problem of designing experiments that are
conducted on a set of units such as users or groups of users in an online
marketplace, for multiple time periods such as weeks or months. These
experiments are particularly useful to study the treatments that have causal
effects on both current and future outcomes (instantaneous and lagged effects).
The design problem involves selecting a treatment time for each unit, before or
during the experiment, in order to most precisely estimate the instantaneous
and lagged effects, post experimentation. This optimization of the treatment
decisions can directly minimize the opportunity cost of the experiment by
reducing its sample size requirement. The optimization is an NP-hard integer
program for which we provide a near-optimal solution, when the design decisions
are performed all at the beginning (fixed-sample-size designs). Next, we study
sequential experiments that allow adaptive decisions during the experiments,
and also potentially early stop the experiments, further reducing their cost.
However, the sequential nature of these experiments complicates both the design
phase and the estimation phase. We propose a new algorithm, PGAE, that
addresses these challenges by adaptively making treatment decisions, estimating
the treatment effects, and drawing valid post-experimentation inference. PGAE
combines ideas from Bayesian statistics, dynamic programming, and sample
splitting. Using synthetic experiments on real data sets from multiple domains,
we demonstrate that our proposed solutions for fixed-sample-size and sequential
experiments reduce the opportunity cost of the experiments by over 50% and 70%,
respectively, compared to benchmarks.</span>

                    <span>Consider two or more forecasters, each making a sequence of predictions for
different events over time. We ask a relatively basic question: how might we
compare these forecasters, either online or post-hoc, while avoiding
unverifiable assumptions on how the forecasts or outcomes were generated? This
work presents a novel and rigorous answer to this question. We design a
sequential inference procedure for estimating the time-varying difference in
forecast quality as measured by any scoring rule. The resulting confidence
intervals are nonasymptotically valid and can be continuously monitored to
yield statistically valid comparisons at arbitrary data-dependent stopping
times (&quot;anytime-valid&quot;); this is enabled by adapting variance-adaptive
supermartingales, confidence sequences, and e-processes to our setting.
Motivated by Shafer and Vovk&#x27;s game-theoretic probability, our coverage
guarantees are also distribution-free, in the sense that they make no
distributional assumptions on the forecasts or outcomes. In contrast to a
recent work by Henzi and Ziegel, our tools can sequentially test a weak null
hypothesis about whether one forecaster outperforms another on average over
time. We demonstrate their effectiveness by comparing probability forecasts on
Major League Baseball (MLB) games and statistical postprocessing methods for
ensemble weather forecasts.</span>

                    <span>We present simple conditions for Bayesian consistency in the supremum metric.
The key to the technique is a triangle inequality which allows us to explicitly
use weak convergence, a consequence of the standard Kullback--Leibler support
condition for the prior. A further condition is to ensure that smoothed
versions of densities are not too far from the original density, thus dealing
with densities which could track the data too closely. A key result of the
paper is that we demonstrate supremum consistency using weaker conditions
compared to those currently used to secure $\mathbb{L}_1$ consistency.</span>

                    <span>Although neural networks (NNs) with ReLU activation functions have found
success in a wide range of applications, their adoption in risk-sensitive
settings has been limited by the concerns on robustness and interpretability.
Previous works to examine robustness and to improve interpretability partially
exploited the piecewise linear function form of ReLU NNs. In this paper, we
explore the unique topological structure that ReLU NNs create in the input
space, identifying the adjacency among the partitioned local polytopes and
developing a traversing algorithm based on this adjacency. Our polytope
traversing algorithm can be adapted to verify a wide range of network
properties related to robustness and interpretability, providing an unified
approach to examine the network behavior. As the traversing algorithm
explicitly visits all local polytopes, it returns a clear and full picture of
the network behavior within the traversed region. The time and space complexity
of the traversing algorithm is determined by the number of a ReLU NN&#x27;s
partitioning hyperplanes passing through the traversing region.</span>

the hierarchical feature regression (HFR) -, which mobilizes insights from the
domains of machine learning and graph theory to estimate robust parameters for
a linear regression. The estimator constructs a supervised feature graph that
decomposes parameters along its edges, adjusting first for common variation and
successively incorporating idiosyncratic patterns into the fitting process. The
graph structure has the effect of shrinking parameters towards group targets,
where the extent of shrinkage is governed by a hyperparamter, and group
compositions as well as shrinkage targets are determined endogenously. The
method offers rich resources for the visual exploration of the latent effect
structure in the data, and demonstrates good predictive accuracy and
versatility when compared to a panel of commonly used regularization techniques
across a range of empirical and simulated regression tasks.</span>

                    <span>We study generalization bounds for noisy stochastic mini-batch iterative
algorithms based on the notion of stability. Recent years have seen key
advances in data-dependent generalization bounds for noisy iterative learning
algorithms such as stochastic gradient Langevin dynamics (SGLD) based on
stability (Mou et al., 2018; Li et al., 2020) and information theoretic
approaches (Xu and Raginsky, 2017; Negrea et al., 2019; Steinke and
Zakynthinou, 2020; Haghifam et al., 2020). In this paper, we unify and
substantially generalize stability based generalization bounds and make three
technical advances. First, we bound the generalization error of general noisy
stochastic iterative algorithms (not necessarily gradient descent) in terms of
expected (not uniform) stability. The expected stability can in turn be bounded
by a Le Cam Style Divergence. Such bounds have a O(1/n) sample dependence
unlike many existing bounds with O(1/\sqrt{n}) dependence. Second, we introduce
Exponential Family Langevin Dynamics(EFLD) which is a substantial
generalization of SGLD and which allows exponential family noise to be used
with stochastic gradient descent (SGD). We establish data-dependent expected
stability based generalization bounds for general EFLD algorithms. Third, we
consider an important special case of EFLD: noisy sign-SGD, which extends
sign-SGD using Bernoulli noise over {-1,+1}. Generalization bounds for noisy
sign-SGD are implied by that of EFLD and we also establish optimization
guarantees for the algorithm. Further, we present empirical results on
benchmark datasets to illustrate that our bounds are non-vacuous and
quantitatively much sharper than existing bounds.</span>

                    <span>Suppose that we have a regression problem with response variable Y in
$\mathbb{R}^d$ and predictor X in $\mathbb{R}^d$, for $d \geq 1$. In permuted
or unlinked regression we have access to separate unordered data on X and Y, as
opposed to data on (X,Y)-pairs in usual regression. So far in the literature
the case $d&#x3D;1$ has received attention, see e.g., the recent papers by Rigollet
and Weed [Information &amp; Inference, 8, 619--717] and Balabdaoui et al. [J. Mach.
Learn. Res., 22(172), 1--60]. In this paper, we consider the general
multivariate setting with $d \geq 1$. We show that the notion of cyclical
monotonicity of the regression function is sufficient for identification and
estimation in the permuted/unlinked regression model. We study permutation
recovery in the permuted regression setting and develop a computationally
efficient and easy-to-use algorithm for denoising based on the Kiefer-Wolfowitz
[Ann. Math. Statist., 27, 887--906] nonparametric maximum likelihood estimator
and techniques from the theory of optimal transport. We provide explicit upper
bounds on the associated mean squared denoising error for Gaussian noise. As in
previous work on the case $d &#x3D; 1$, the permuted/unlinked setting involves slow
(logarithmic) rates of convergence rooting in the underlying deconvolution
problem. Numerical studies corroborate our theoretical analysis and show that
the proposed approach performs at least on par with the methods in the
aforementioned prior work in the case $d &#x3D; 1$ while achieving substantial
reductions in terms of computational complexity.</span>

                    <span>We develop a structural econometric model to capture the decision dynamics of
human evaluators on an online micro-lending platform, and estimate the model
parameters using a real-world dataset. We find two types of biases in gender,
preference-based bias and belief-based bias, are present in human evaluators&#x27;
decisions. Both types of biases are in favor of female applicants. Through
counterfactual simulations, we quantify the effect of gender bias on loan
granting outcomes and the welfare of the company and the borrowers. Our results
imply that both the existence of the preference-based bias and that of the
belief-based bias reduce the company&#x27;s profits. When the preference-based bias
is removed, the company earns more profits. When the belief-based bias is
removed, the company&#x27;s profits also increase. Both increases result from
raising the approval probability for borrowers, especially male borrowers, who
eventually pay back loans. For borrowers, the elimination of either bias
decreases the gender gap of the true positive rates in the credit risk
evaluation. We also train machine learning algorithms on both the real-world
data and the data from the counterfactual simulations. We compare the decisions
made by those algorithms to see how evaluators&#x27; biases are inherited by the
algorithms and reflected in machine-based decisions. We find that machine
learning algorithms can mitigate both the preference-based bias and the
belief-based bias.</span>

                    <span>Multi-armed bandits a simple but very powerful framework for algorithms that
make decisions over time under uncertainty. An enormous body of work has
accumulated over the years, covered in several books and surveys. This book
provides a more introductory, textbook-like treatment of the subject. Each
chapter tackles a particular line of work, providing a self-contained,
teachable technical introduction and a brief review of the further
developments; many of the chapters conclude with exercises.

The book is structured as follows. The first four chapters are on IID
rewards, from the basic model to impossibility results to Bayesian priors to
Lipschitz rewards. The next three chapters cover adversarial rewards, from the
full-feedback version to adversarial bandits to extensions with linear rewards
and combinatorially structured actions. Chapter 8 is on contextual bandits, a
middle ground between IID and adversarial bandits in which the change in reward
distributions is completely explained by observable contexts. The last three
chapters cover connections to economics, from learning in repeated games to
bandits with supply/budget constraints to exploration in the presence of
incentives. The appendix provides sufficient background on concentration and

                    <span>The paper proposes and investigates an approach for surrogate-assisted
performance prediction of data-driven knowledge discovery algorithms. The
approach is based on the identification of surrogate models for prediction of
the target algorithm&#x27;s quality and performance. The proposed approach was
implemented and investigated as applied to an evolutionary algorithm for
discovering clusters of interpretable clinical pathways in electronic health
records of patients with acute coronary syndrome. Several clustering metrics
and execution time were used as the target quality and performance metrics
respectively. An analytical software prototype based on the proposed approach
for the prediction of algorithm characteristics and feature analysis was
developed to provide a more interpretable prediction of the target algorithm&#x27;s
performance and quality that can be further used for parameter tuning.</span>

                    <span>Approximate Bayesian inference methods provide a powerful suite of tools for
finding approximations to intractable posterior distributions. However, machine
learning applications typically involve selecting actions, which -- in a
Bayesian setting -- depend on the posterior distribution only via its
contribution to expected utility. A growing body of work on loss-calibrated
approximate inference methods has therefore sought to develop posterior
approximations sensitive to the influence of the utility function. Here we
introduce loss-calibrated expectation propagation (Loss-EP), a loss-calibrated
variant of expectation propagation. This method resembles standard EP with an
additional factor that &quot;tilts&quot; the posterior towards higher-utility decisions.
We show applications to Gaussian process classification under binary utility
functions with asymmetric penalties on False Negative and False Positive
errors, and show how this asymmetry can have dramatic consequences on what
information is &quot;useful&quot; to capture in an approximation.</span>

                    <span>We consider a sequential setting in which a single dataset of individuals is
used to perform adaptively-chosen analyses, while ensuring that the
differential privacy loss of each participant does not exceed a pre-specified
privacy budget. The standard approach to this problem relies on bounding a
worst-case estimate of the privacy loss over all individuals and all possible
values of their data, for every single analysis. Yet, in many scenarios this
approach is overly conservative, especially for &quot;typical&quot; data points which
incur little privacy loss by participation in most of the analyses. In this
work, we give a method for tighter privacy loss accounting based on the value
of a personalized privacy loss estimate for each individual in each analysis.
To implement the accounting method we design a filter for R\&#x27;enyi differential
privacy. A filter is a tool that ensures that the privacy parameter of a
composed sequence of algorithms with adaptively-chosen privacy parameters does
not exceed a pre-specified budget. Our filter is simpler and tighter than the
known filter for $(\epsilon,\delta)$-differential privacy by Rogers et al. We
apply our results to the analysis of noisy gradient descent and show that
personalized accounting can be practical, easy to implement, and can only make
the privacy-utility tradeoff tighter.</span>

denoising. The general framework is then applied to nonparametric regression
methods such as Trend Filtering and Dyadic CART. The resulting cross validated
versions are then shown to attain nearly the same rates of convergence as are
known for the optimally tuned analogues. There did not exist any previous
theoretical analyses of cross validated versions of Trend Filtering or Dyadic
CART. To illustrate the generality of the framework we also propose and study
cross validated versions of two fundamental estimators; lasso for high
dimensional linear regression and singular value thresholding for matrix
estimation. Our general framework is inspired by the ideas in Chatterjee and
Jafarov (2015) and is potentially applicable to a wide range of estimation

                    <span>Nested simulation concerns estimating functionals of a conditional
expectation via simulation. In this paper, we propose a new method based on
kernel ridge regression to exploit the smoothness of the conditional
expectation as a function of the multidimensional conditioning variable.
Asymptotic analysis shows that the proposed method can effectively alleviate
the curse of dimensionality on the convergence rate as the simulation budget
increases, provided that the conditional expectation is sufficiently smooth.
The smoothness bridges the gap between the cubic root convergence rate (that
is, the optimal rate for the standard nested simulation) and the square root
convergence rate (that is, the canonical rate for the standard Monte Carlo
simulation). We demonstrate the performance of the proposed method via
numerical examples from portfolio risk management and input uncertainty
quantification.</span>

                    <span>A significant bottleneck in federated learning is the network communication
cost of sending model updates from client devices to the central server. We
propose a method to reduce this cost. Our method encodes quantized updates with
an appropriate universal code, taking into account their empirical
distribution. Because quantization introduces error, we select quantization
levels by optimizing for the desired trade-off in average total bitrate and
gradient distortion. We demonstrate empirically that in spite of the non-i.i.d.
nature of federated learning, the rate-distortion frontier is consistent across
datasets, optimizers, clients and training rounds, and within each setting,
distortion reliably predicts model performance. This allows for a remarkably
simple compression scheme that is near-optimal in many use cases, and
outperforms Top-K, DRIVE, 3LC and QSGD on the Stack Overflow next-word
prediction benchmark.</span>

                    <span>A new approach called ABRF (the attention-based random forest) and its
modifications for applying the attention mechanism to the random forest (RF)
for regression and classification are proposed. The main idea behind the
proposed ABRF models is to assign attention weights with trainable parameters
to decision trees in a specific way. The weights depend on the distance between
an instance, which falls into a corresponding leaf of a tree, and instances,
which fall in the same leaf. This idea stems from representation of the
Nadaraya-Watson kernel regression in the form of a RF. Three modifications of
the general approach are proposed. The first one is based on applying the
Huber&#x27;s contamination model and on computing the attention weights by solving
quadratic or linear optimization problems. The second and the third
modifications use the gradient-based algorithms for computing trainable
parameters. Numerical experiments with various regression and classification
datasets illustrate the proposed method.</span>

                    <span>The mathematical forces at work behind Generative Adversarial Networks raise
challenging theoretical issues. Motivated by the important question of
characterizing the geometrical properties of the generated distributions, we
provide a thorough analysis of Wasserstein GANs (WGANs) in both the finite
sample and asymptotic regimes. We study the specific case where the latent
space is univariate and derive results valid regardless of the dimension of the
output space. We show in particular that for a fixed sample size, the optimal
WGANs are closely linked with connected paths minimizing the sum of the squared
Euclidean distances between the sample points. We also highlight the fact that
WGANs are able to approach (for the 1-Wasserstein distance) the target
distribution as the sample size tends to infinity, at a given convergence rate
and provided the family of generative Lipschitz functions grows appropriately.
We derive in passing new results on optimal transport theory in the
semi-discrete setting.</span>

                    <span>In this paper we present AIDA, which is an active inference-based agent that
iteratively designs a personalized audio processing algorithm through situated
interactions with a human client. The target application of AIDA is to propose
on-the-spot the most interesting alternative values for the tuning parameters
of a hearing aid (HA) algorithm, whenever a HA client is not satisfied with
their HA performance. AIDA interprets searching for the &quot;most interesting
alternative&quot; as an issue of optimal (acoustic) context-aware Bayesian trial
design. In computational terms, AIDA is realized as an active inference-based
agent with an Expected Free Energy criterion for trial design. This type of
architecture is inspired by neuro-economic models on efficient (Bayesian) trial
design in brains and implies that AIDA comprises generative probabilistic
models for acoustic signals and user responses. We propose a novel generative
model for acoustic signals as a sum of time-varying auto-regressive filters and
a user response model based on a Gaussian Process Classifier. The full AIDA
agent has been implemented in a factor graph for the generative model and all
tasks (parameter learning, acoustic context classification, trial design, etc.)
are realized by variational message passing on the factor graph. All
verification and validation experiments and demonstrations are freely

time-varying additive constraints in the presence of predictions for the next

combining a Follow-The-Regularized-Leader iteration with prediction-adaptive
dynamic steps. The algorithm achieves $\mathcal O(T^{\frac{3-\beta}{4}})$
regret and $\mathcal O(T^{\frac{1+\beta}{2}})$ constraint violation bounds that
are tunable via parameter $\beta\!\in\![1/2,1)$ and have constant factors that
shrink with the predictions quality, achieving eventually $\mathcal O(1)$
regret for perfect predictions. Our work extends the FTRL framework for this
constrained OCO setting and outperforms the respective state-of-the-art
greedy-based solutions, without imposing conditions on the quality of
predictions, the cost functions or the geometry of constraints, beyond

                    <span>Partial differential equations (PDEs) play a crucial role in studying a vast
number of problems in science and engineering. Numerically solving nonlinear
and/or high-dimensional PDEs is often a challenging task. Inspired by the
traditional finite difference and finite elements methods and emerging
advancements in machine learning, we propose a sequence deep learning framework
called Neural-PDE, which allows to automatically learn governing rules of any
time-dependent PDE system from existing data by using a bidirectional LSTM
encoder, and predict the next n time steps data. One critical feature of our
proposed framework is that the Neural-PDE is able to simultaneously learn and
simulate the multiscale variables.We test the Neural-PDE by a range of examples
from one-dimensional PDEs to a high-dimensional and nonlinear complex fluids
model. The results show that the Neural-PDE is capable of learning the initial
conditions, boundary conditions and differential operators without the
knowledge of the specific form of a PDE system.In our experiments the
Neural-PDE can efficiently extract the dynamics within 20 epochs training, and
produces accurate predictions. Furthermore, unlike the traditional machine
learning approaches in learning PDE such as CNN and MLP which require vast
parameters for model precision, Neural-PDE shares parameters across all time
steps, thus considerably reduces the computational complexity and leads to a
fast learning algorithm.</span>

synthesizing information across the input. SCROLLS contains summarization,
question answering, and natural language inference tasks, covering multiple

baselines, including Longformer Encoder-Decoder, indicate that there is ample

                    <span>Nesterov&#x27;s accelerated gradient (AG) is a popular technique to optimize
objective functions comprising two components: a convex loss and a penalty
function. While AG methods perform well for convex penalties, such as the
LASSO, convergence issues may arise when it is applied to nonconvex penalties,
such as SCAD. A recent proposal generalizes Nesterov&#x27;s AG method to the
nonconvex setting but has never been applied to sparse statistical learning
problems. There are several hyperparameters to be set before running the
proposed algorithm. However, there is no explicit rule as to how the
hyperparameters should be selected. In this article, we consider the
application of this nonconvex AG algorithm to high-dimensional linear and
logistic sparse learning problems, and propose a hyperparameter setting based
on the complexity upper bound to accelerate convergence. We further establish
the rate of convergence and present a simple and useful bound for the damping
sequence. Simulation studies show that convergence can be made, on average,
considerably faster than that of the conventional ISTA algorithm. Our
experiments also show that the proposed method generally outperforms the
current state-of-the-art method in terms of signal recovery.</span>

                    <span>Linear and Quadratic Discriminant Analysis are well-known classical methods
but can heavily suffer from non-Gaussian distributions and/or contaminated
datasets, mainly because of the underlying Gaussian assumption that is not
robust. To fill this gap, this paper presents a new robust discriminant
analysis where each data point is drawn by its own arbitrary Elliptically
Symmetrical (ES) distribution and its own arbitrary scale parameter. Such a
model allows for possibly very heterogeneous, independent but non-identically
distributed samples. After deriving a new decision rule, it is shown that
maximum-likelihood parameter estimation and classification are very simple,
fast and robust compared to state-of-the-art methods.</span>

                    <span>The filtering equations govern the evolution of the conditional distribution
of a signal process given partial, and possibly noisy, observations arriving
sequentially in time. Their numerical approximation plays a central role in
many real-life applications, including numerical weather prediction, finance
and engineering. One of the classical approaches to approximate the solution of
the filtering equations is to use a PDE inspired method, called the
splitting-up method, initiated by Gyongy, Krylov, LeGland, among other
contributors. This method, and other PDE based approaches, have particular
applicability for solving low-dimensional problems. In this work we combine
this method with a neural network representation. The new methodology is used
to produce an approximation of the unnormalised conditional distribution of the
signal process. We further develop a recursive normalisation procedure to
recover the normalised conditional distribution of the signal process. The new
scheme can be iterated over multiple time steps whilst keeping its asymptotic
unbiasedness property intact.

We test the neural network approximations with numerical approximation
results for the Kalman and Benes filter.</span>

                    <span>We formulate selecting the best optimizing system (SBOS) problems and provide
solutions for those problems. In an SBOS problem, a finite number of systems
are contenders. Inside each system, a continuous decision variable affects the
system&#x27;s expected performance. An SBOS problem compares different systems based
on their expected performances under their own optimally chosen decision to
select the best, without advance knowledge of expected performances of the
systems nor the optimizing decision inside each system. We design
easy-to-implement algorithms that adaptively chooses a system and a choice of
decision to evaluate the noisy system performance, sequentially eliminates
inferior systems, and eventually recommends a system as the best after spending
a user-specified budget. The proposed algorithms integrate the stochastic
gradient descent method and the sequential elimination method to simultaneously
exploit the structure inside each system and make comparisons across systems.
For the proposed algorithms, we prove exponential rates of convergence to zero
for the probability of false selection, as the budget grows to infinity. We
conduct three numerical examples that represent three practical cases of SBOS
problems. Our proposed algorithms demonstrate consistent and stronger
performances in terms of the probability of false selection over benchmark
algorithms under a range of problem settings and sampling budgets.</span>

researchers in the area primarily rely on UCI Adult when it comes to tabular
data. Derived from a 1994 US Census survey, this dataset has appeared in
hundreds of research papers where it served as the basis for the development
and comparison of many algorithmic fairness interventions. We reconstruct a
superset of the UCI Adult data from available US Census sources and reveal
idiosyncrasies of the UCI Adult dataset that limit its external validity. Our
primary contribution is a suite of new datasets derived from US Census surveys
that extend the existing data ecosystem for research on fair machine learning.
We create prediction tasks relating to income, employment, health,
transportation, and housing. The data span multiple years and all states of the
United States, allowing researchers to study temporal shift and geographic
variation. We highlight a broad initial sweep of new empirical insights
relating to trade-offs between fairness criteria, performance of algorithmic
interventions, and the role of distribution shift based on our new datasets.
Our findings inform ongoing debates, challenge some existing narratives, and
point to future research directions. Our datasets are available at

                    <span>We study the problem of Differentially Private Stochastic Convex Optimization
(DP-SCO) with heavy-tailed data. Specifically, we focus on the $\ell_1$-norm
linear regression in the $\epsilon$-DP model. While most of the previous work
focuses on the case where the loss function is Lipschitz, here we only need to
assume the variates has bounded moments. Firstly, we study the case where the
$\ell_2$ norm of data has bounded second order moment. We propose an algorithm
which is based on the exponential mechanism and show that it is possible to
achieve an upper bound of $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{\frac{d}{n\epsilon}})$ (with high
probability). Next, we relax the assumption to bounded $\theta$-th order moment
with some $\theta\in (1, 2)$ and show that it is possible to achieve an upper
bound of $\tilde{O}(({\frac{d}{n\epsilon}})^\frac{\theta-1}{\theta})$. Our
algorithms can also be extended to more relaxed cases where only each
coordinate of the data has bounded moments, and we can get an upper bound of
$\tilde{O}({\frac{d}{\sqrt{n\epsilon}}})$ and
$\tilde{O}({\frac{d}{({n\epsilon})^\frac{\theta-1}{\theta}}})$ in the second
and $\theta$-th moment case respectively.</span>

                    <span>In supervised learning, training and test datasets are often sampled from
distinct distributions. Domain adaptation techniques are thus required.
Covariate shift adaptation yields good generalization performance when domains
differ only by the marginal distribution of features. Covariate shift
adaptation is usually implemented using importance weighting, which may fail,
according to common wisdom, due to small effective sample sizes (ESS). Previous
research argues this scenario is more common in high-dimensional settings.
However, how effective sample size, dimensionality, and model
performance/generalization are formally related in supervised learning,
considering the context of covariate shift adaptation, is still somewhat
obscure in the literature. Thus, a main challenge is presenting a unified
theory connecting those points. Hence, in this paper, we focus on building a
unified view connecting the ESS, data dimensionality, and generalization in the
context of covariate shift adaptation. Moreover, we also demonstrate how
dimensionality reduction or feature selection can increase the ESS, and argue
that our results support dimensionality reduction before covariate shift
adaptation as a good practice.</span>

                    <span>Reward hacking -- where RL agents exploit gaps in misspecified reward
functions -- has been widely observed, but not yet systematically studied. To
understand how reward hacking arises, we construct four RL environments with
misspecified rewards. We investigate reward hacking as a function of agent
capabilities: model capacity, action space resolution, observation space noise,
and training time. More capable agents often exploit reward misspecifications,
achieving higher proxy reward and lower true reward than less capable agents.
Moreover, we find instances of phase transitions: capability thresholds at
which the agent&#x27;s behavior qualitatively shifts, leading to a sharp decrease in
the true reward. Such phase transitions pose challenges to monitoring the
safety of ML systems. To address this, we propose an anomaly detection task for
aberrant policies and offer several baseline detectors.</span>

                    <span>Due to their increasing spread, confidence in neural network predictions
became more and more important. However, basic neural networks do not deliver
certainty estimates or suffer from over or under confidence. Many researchers
have been working on understanding and quantifying uncertainty in a neural
network&#x27;s prediction. As a result, different types and sources of uncertainty
have been identified and a variety of approaches to measure and quantify
uncertainty in neural networks have been proposed. This work gives a
comprehensive overview of uncertainty estimation in neural networks, reviews
recent advances in the field, highlights current challenges, and identifies
potential research opportunities. It is intended to give anyone interested in
uncertainty estimation in neural networks a broad overview and introduction,
without presupposing prior knowledge in this field. A comprehensive
introduction to the most crucial sources of uncertainty is given and their
separation into reducible model uncertainty and not reducible data uncertainty
is presented. The modeling of these uncertainties based on deterministic neural
networks, Bayesian neural networks, ensemble of neural networks, and test-time
data augmentation approaches is introduced and different branches of these
fields as well as the latest developments are discussed. For a practical
application, we discuss different measures of uncertainty, approaches for the
calibration of neural networks and give an overview of existing baselines and
implementations. Different examples from the wide spectrum of challenges in
different fields give an idea of the needs and challenges regarding
uncertainties in practical applications. Additionally, the practical
limitations of current methods for mission- and safety-critical real world
applications are discussed and an outlook on the next steps towards a broader
usage of such methods is given.</span>

                    <span>The input of almost every machine learning algorithm targeting the properties
of matter at the atomic scale involves a transformation of the list of
Cartesian atomic coordinates into a more symmetric representation. Many of the
most popular representations can be seen as an expansion of the symmetrized
correlations of the atom density, and differ mainly by the choice of basis.
Considerable effort has been dedicated to the optimization of the basis set,
typically driven by heuristic considerations on the behavior of the regression
target. Here we take a different, unsupervised viewpoint, aiming to determine
the basis that encodes in the most compact way possible the structural
information that is relevant for the dataset at hand. For each training dataset
and number of basis functions, one can determine a unique basis that is optimal
in this sense, and can be computed at no additional cost with respect to the
primitive basis by approximating it with splines. We demonstrate that this
construction yields representations that are accurate and computationally
efficient, particularly when constructing representations that correspond to
high-body order correlations. We present examples that involve both molecular
and condensed-phase machine-learning models.</span>

                    <span>A Bayesian network is a graphical model that encodes probabilistic
relationships among variables of interest. When used in conjunction with
statistical techniques, the graphical model has several advantages for data
analysis. One, because the model encodes dependencies among all variables, it
readily handles situations where some data entries are missing. Two, a Bayesian
network can be used to learn causal relationships, and hence can be used to
gain understanding about a problem domain and to predict the consequences of
intervention. Three, because the model has both a causal and probabilistic
semantics, it is an ideal representation for combining prior knowledge (which
often comes in causal form) and data. Four, Bayesian statistical methods in
conjunction with Bayesian networks offer an efficient and principled approach
for avoiding the overfitting of data. In this paper, we discuss methods for
constructing Bayesian networks from prior knowledge and summarize Bayesian
statistical methods for using data to improve these models. With regard to the
latter task, we describe methods for learning both the parameters and structure
of a Bayesian network, including techniques for learning with incomplete data.
In addition, we relate Bayesian-network methods for learning to techniques for
supervised and unsupervised learning. We illustrate the graphical-modeling
approach using a real-world case study.</span>

                    <span>This paper focuses on the Matrix Factorization based Clustering (MFC) method
which is one of the few closed form algorithms for the subspace clustering
problem. Despite being simple, closed-form, and computation-efficient, MFC can
outperform the other sophisticated subspace clustering methods in many
challenging scenarios. We reveal the connection between MFC and the Innovation
Pursuit (iPursuit) algorithm which was shown to be able to outperform the other
spectral clustering based methods with a notable margin especially when the
span of clusters are close. A novel theoretical study is presented which sheds
light on the key performance factors of both algorithms (MFC/iPursuit) and it
is shown that both algorithms can be robust to notable intersections between
the span of clusters. Importantly, in contrast to the theoretical guarantees of
other algorithms which emphasized on the distance between the subspaces as the
key performance factor and without making the innovation assumption, it is
shown that the performance of MFC/iPursuit mainly depends on the distance
between the innovative components of the clusters.</span>

                    <span>Historically, machine learning methods have not been designed with security
in mind. In turn, this has given rise to adversarial examples, carefully
perturbed input samples aimed to mislead detection at test time, which have
been applied to attack spam and malware classification, and more recently to
attack image classification. Consequently, an abundance of research has been
devoted to designing machine learning methods that are robust to adversarial
examples. Unfortunately, there are desiderata besides robustness that a secure
and safe machine learning model must satisfy, such as fairness and privacy.
Recent work by Song et al. (2019) has shown, empirically, that there exists a
trade-off between robust and private machine learning models. Models designed
to be robust to adversarial examples often overfit on training data to a larger
extent than standard (non-robust) models. If a dataset contains private
information, then any statistical test that separates training and test data by
observing a model&#x27;s outputs can represent a privacy breach, and if a model
overfits on training data, these statistical tests become easier.

In this work, we identify settings where standard models will overfit to a
larger extent in comparison to robust models, and as empirically observed in
previous works, settings where the opposite behavior occurs. Thus, it is not
necessarily the case that privacy must be sacrificed to achieve robustness. The
degree of overfitting naturally depends on the amount of data available for
training. We go on to characterize how the training set size factors into the
privacy risks exposed by training a robust model on a simple Gaussian data
task, and show empirically that our findings hold on image classification
benchmark datasets, such as CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100.</span>

dynamic systems and neural networks is increasingly benefiting each other in a
lot of different ways. Since uncertainties often arise in real world
observations, SDEs (stochastic differential equations) come to play an
important role. To be more specific, in this paper, we use a collection of SDEs
equipped with neural networks to predict long-term trend of noisy time series
which has big jump properties and high probability distribution shift. Our
contributions are, first, we explored SDEs driven by $\alpha$-stable L\&#x27;evy
motion to model the time series data and solved the problem through neural
network approximation. Second, we theoretically proved the convergence of the
model and obtained the convergence rate. Finally, we illustrated our method by

                    <span>We study a seemingly unexpected and relatively less understood overfitting
aspect of a fundamental tool in sparse linear modeling - best subset selection,
which minimizes the residual sum of squares subject to a constraint on the
number of nonzero coefficients. While the best subset selection procedure is
often perceived as the &quot;gold standard&quot; in sparse learning when the signal to
noise ratio (SNR) is high, its predictive performance deteriorates when the SNR
is low. In particular, it is outperformed by continuous shrinkage methods, such
as ridge regression and the Lasso. We investigate the behavior of best subset
selection in the high-noise regimes and propose an alternative approach based
on a regularized version of the least-squares criterion. Our proposed
estimators (a) mitigate, to a large extent, the poor predictive performance of
best subset selection in the high-noise regimes; and (b) perform favorably,
while generally delivering substantially sparser models, relative to the best
predictive models available via ridge regression and the Lasso. We conduct an
extensive theoretical analysis of the predictive properties of the proposed
approach and provide justification for its superior predictive performance
relative to best subset selection when the noise-level is high. Our estimators
can be expressed as solutions to mixed integer second order conic optimization
problems and, hence, are amenable to modern computational tools from
mathematical optimization.</span>

                    <span>Discriminative features are crucial for several learning applications, such
as object detection and classification. Neural networks are extensively used
for extracting discriminative features of images and speech signals. However,
the lack of large datasets in the haptics domain often limits the applicability
of such techniques. This paper presents a general framework for the analysis of
the discriminative properties of haptic signals. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of spectral features and a boosted embedding technique in
enhancing the distinguishability of haptic signals. Experiments indicate our
framework needs less training data, generalizes well for different predictors,
and outperforms the related state-of-the-art.</span>

                    <span>There has been a surge of interest in developing robust estimators for models
with heavy-tailed data in statistics and machine learning. This paper proposes
a log-truncated M-estimator for a large family of statistical regressions and
establishes its excess risk bound under the condition that the data have
$(1+\varepsilon)$-th moment with $\varepsilon \in (0,1]$. With an additional
assumption on the associated risk function, we obtain an $\ell_2$-error bound
for the estimation. Our theorems are applied to establish robust M-estimators
for concrete regressions. Besides convex regressions such as quantile
regression and generalized linear models, many non-convex regressions can also
be fit into our theorems, we focus on robust deep neural network regressions,
which can be solved by the stochastic gradient descent algorithms. Simulations
and real data analysis demonstrate the superiority of log-truncated estimations
over standard estimations.</span>

                    <span>It feels like every topic is heavily researched. There are 100 new papers everyday mentioning small improvements to previous architectures/models with some tweaking. Every task has a near 100% accuracy. Is AI research reaching saturation? What do you guys work on, and how competitive is it in your area? How do you keep up with the several papers cpming in everyday?

                    <span>Besides for MNIST, what datasets are generally standard to test a method out on? I am looking to test out a non-deep clustering method on various benchmarks.
 When I look at papers accepted into top ML conferences like NeurIPS, ICML and ICLR, there doesn&#x27;t appear to be a consistent set of benchmarks. Is there a standard set of clustering benchmarks one is supposed to deploy new methods on?
 ( I would not expect it this method I&#x27;m testing to perform well on e.g. CIFAR-10. My impression is that almost all non-deep methods that aren&#x27;t custom-tuned to images perform poorly on CIFAR-10)

Like I was going through University of Adelaide and found they have their dedicated Computer Vision lab among others which has also produced some good SOTA results in the past. But apart from that, what other universities would the community recommend? Or are there any certain professors which could be of interest. Any suggestions are welcome :)

                    <span>I have an issue with the training of a GAN, which consists of a generator and two discriminators. The generator is used to generate waveforms.
 1-The generator is independently pre-trained by regression, up to 400k steps.
 2-The two randomly initialized discriminators are then activated, and GANs training takes place.
 The orange curve, represents the l1-norm between input and output: the l1-norm steeply rises for the first few validation steps. In the blue curve, I tried freezing the generator for 80k steps, to allow pre-training of the discriminators, but the problems persists.
 However, step 2 inititially degrades the output of the generator, by removing too much information. This is also reflected in all the validation losses (see image above), whose values get worse.
 The GAN is based or a variation of the code below:
 https://github.com/rishikksh20/hifigan-denoiser/blob/master/train.py

TL;DR: The code is here.
  
Time Series Forecasting can be overwhelming. Especially if you are just getting started. There are many different types of Time Series tasks each differs by the number of input or output sequences, the number of steps to predict, whether the input and/or the output sequence length is static or changing, and so on. In this notebook, we will experiment with different types of Time Series Cross-Validation Strategies in order to become familiar with them and understand which works best for what case. 
 As written before, Time Series problems can be of different variations, so in order to get a deeper understanding, we should explore each.

                    <span>GPU Multiprocessing for Parameter Optimization
  
TL;DR: The code is here
  
Hi Guys, 
 I published a notebook using a trick for running multiprocessing on GPU devices. Might be interesting for some here, so have fun:
 As we know, GPU makes everything faster. Moreover, oftentimes the GPU device we use is so powerful that our code doesn&#x27;t utilize the GPU code to 100% potential. In such cases, running multiple GPU instances in parallel can come in handy and save us some extra time.
 I&#x27;ve made a notebook that introduces a method for running parallel jobs on GPU devices. It is a bit tricky since most packages that support GPU usage aren&#x27;t built from the ground up for such use cases.
 The &quot;trick&quot; is simple: We simply do not call the GPU in the main process, the first time we call for any GPU utilization should be from the child processes. 
 ![](https://i.ibb.co/VDpCKT4/gpu-multiprocessing.png)
 To demonstrate the power of this concept, I made a notebook that runs Parallel Hyperparameters Optimization on the GPU for LightGBM. As it is assumed, the GPU enables us to train our models faster (much faster) and by leveraging that in combination with the parallel execution we get to search a large space of parameter configurations for fully maximizing our model&#x27;s performance (Since we can now try many combinations). The Optimization framework is optuna, the popular framework for optimizing the hyperparameters. Again, this is just an example of the approach. You can use the same approach for many other GPU-enabled use cases. 
 Personally, This concept helped me over and over as it is easily transferable to many different GPU-based models including Neural Networks (Tensorflow, Pytorch..), Other GBM models (Catboost, XGBoost..), Feature Engineering (Pandas, CuPy), and more.

                    <span>Paper: https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.03916. First survey on the recently developing field of AutoRL.
 Abstract: The combination of Reinforcement Learning (RL) with deep learning has led to a series of impressive feats, with many believing (deep) RL provides a path towards generally capable agents. However, the success of RL agents is often highly sensitive to design choices in the training process, which may require tedious and error-prone manual tuning. This makes it challenging to use RL for new problems, while also limits its full potential. In many other areas of machine learning, AutoML has shown it is possible to automate such design choices and has also yielded promising initial results when applied to RL. However, Automated Reinforcement Learning (AutoRL) involves not only standard applications of AutoML but also includes additional challenges unique to RL, that naturally produce a different set of methods. As such, AutoRL has been emerging as an important area of research in RL, providing promise in a variety of applications from RNA design to playing games such as Go. Given the diversity of methods and environments considered in RL, much of the research has been conducted in distinct subfields, ranging from meta-learning to evolution. In this survey we seek to unify the field of AutoRL, we provide a common taxonomy, discuss each area in detail and pose open problems which would be of interest to researchers going forward.

                    <span>While we have seen several new SOTA image generation models pop up over the last year, video generation still remains lackluster, to say the least. But does it have to be? The authors of StyleGAN-V certainly don’t think so! By adapting the generator from StyleGAN2 to work with motion conditions, developing a hypernetwork-based discriminator, and designing a clever acyclic positional encoding, Ivan Skorohodov and the team at KAUST and Snap Inc. deliver a model that generates videos of arbitrary length with arbitrary framerate, is just 5% more expensive to train than a vanilla StyleGAN2, and beats multiple baseline models on 256 and 1024 resolution. Oh, and it only needs to see about 2 frames from a video during training to do so!
 And if that wasn’t impressive enough, StyleGAN-V is CLIP-compatible for first-ever text-based consistent video editing

                    <span>Hi! I&#x27;ve been studying Policy Gradient algorithms and implementing them and I&#x27;ve found that with the same amount of data (~5000 samples in total over multiple episodes, 50 &quot;epochs&quot;) the simple and basic VPG algorithm with &quot;reward-to-go&quot; function converges to average return of 200 on CartPole-v0 env much, MUCH faster than A2C.
 Is that how it&#x27;s supposed to be? Shouldn&#x27;t the A2C version (with less variance, as the authors claim) be better at convergence?
 Edit: I&#x27;ve just found a bug in my code, which has improved my results, but still made it comparable to simple VPG.
 Edit 2: I apologize for even asking the question... It seems that playing around with hyper parameters can change situation drastically.

                    <span>Hello there :D,
 I am currently working on a RL environment of a agent (robot/drone) moving around in the environment to look for a target. Currently I use PPO with Convolutional nets (CNN), where the observations are maps of the area (something like grid world), showing where walls, agents positions, etc are. In a certain timestep the agent collects a stack of maps (3-4) that are fed to the network.
 I want to move to using LSTM, and I was wondering what other ways can I use to model the observations? Keep in mind my observations should contain agents positions (an agent observes its own location and the locations of other agents) and obstacles in the environment (walls determined by position and dimensions). Is there a better way of modeling these than CNN?
 I though of using a normal feed forward network, and just feed positions directly and use embeddings for the walls, but I&#x27;m not sure how scalable that would be for increasing number of agents (more agents &#x3D; more input), while in CNN the map dimensions stays the same and just more pixels are set to 1 indicating the agents&#x27; locations.
 Any insights?

                    <span>Extending the forecasting time is a critical demand for real applications,
such as extreme weather early warning and long-term energy consumption
planning. This paper studies the long-term forecasting problem of time series.
Prior Transformer-based models adopt various self-attention mechanisms to
discover the long-range dependencies. However, intricate temporal patterns of
the long-term future prohibit the model from finding reliable dependencies.
Also, Transformers have to adopt the sparse versions of point-wise
self-attentions for long series efficiency, resulting in the information
utilization bottleneck. Going beyond Transformers, we design Autoformer as a
novel decomposition architecture with an Auto-Correlation mechanism. We break
with the pre-processing convention of series decomposition and renovate it as a
basic inner block of deep models. This design empowers Autoformer with
progressive decomposition capacities for complex time series. Further, inspired
by the stochastic process theory, we design the Auto-Correlation mechanism
based on the series periodicity, which conducts the dependencies discovery and
representation aggregation at the sub-series level. Auto-Correlation
outperforms self-attention in both efficiency and accuracy. In long-term
forecasting, Autoformer yields state-of-the-art accuracy, with a 38% relative
improvement on six benchmarks, covering five practical applications: energy,
traffic, economics, weather and disease. Code is available at this repository:

                    <span>Recent advances in AIoT technologies have led to an increasing popularity of
utilizing machine learning algorithms to detect operational failures for
cyber-physical systems (CPS). In its basic form, an anomaly detection module
monitors the sensor measurements and actuator states from the physical plant,
and detects anomalies in these measurements to identify abnormal operation
status. Nevertheless, building effective anomaly detection models for CPS is
rather challenging as the model has to accurately detect anomalies in presence
of highly complicated system dynamics and unknown amount of sensor noise. In
this work, we propose a novel time series anomaly detection method called
Neural System Identification and Bayesian Filtering (NSIBF) in which a
specially crafted neural network architecture is posed for system
identification, i.e., capturing the dynamics of CPS in a dynamical state-space
model; then a Bayesian filtering algorithm is naturally applied on top of the
&quot;identified&quot; state-space model for robust anomaly detection by tracking the
uncertainty of the hidden state of the system recursively over time. We provide
qualitative as well as quantitative experiments with the proposed method on a
synthetic and three real-world CPS datasets, showing that NSIBF compares
favorably to the state-of-the-art methods with considerable improvements on
anomaly detection in CPS.</span>

                    <span>Deep neural networks (DNNs) have achieved the state of the art performance in
numerous fields. However, DNNs need high computation times, and people always
expect better performance in a lower computation. Therefore, we study the human
somatosensory system and design a neural network (SpinalNet) to achieve higher
accuracy with fewer computations. Hidden layers in traditional NNs receive
inputs in the previous layer, apply activation function, and then transfer the
outcomes to the next layer. In the proposed SpinalNet, each layer is split into
three splits: 1) input split, 2) intermediate split, and 3) output split. Input
split of each layer receives a part of the inputs. The intermediate split of
each layer receives outputs of the intermediate split of the previous layer and
outputs of the input split of the current layer. The number of incoming weights
becomes significantly lower than traditional DNNs. The SpinalNet can also be
used as the fully connected or classification layer of DNN and supports both
traditional learning and transfer learning. We observe significant error
reductions with lower computational costs in most of the DNNs. Traditional
learning on the VGG-5 network with SpinalNet classification layers provided the
state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on QMNIST, Kuzushiji-MNIST, EMNIST
(Letters, Digits, and Balanced) datasets. Traditional learning with ImageNet
pre-trained initial weights and SpinalNet classification layers provided the
SOTA performance on STL-10, Fruits 360, Bird225, and Caltech-101 datasets. The
scripts of the proposed SpinalNet are available at the following link:

                    <span>Collaborating with humans requires rapidly adapting to their individual
strengths, weaknesses, and preferences. Unfortunately, most standard
multi-agent reinforcement learning techniques, such as self-play (SP) or
population play (PP), produce agents that overfit to their training partners
and do not generalize well to humans. Alternatively, researchers can collect
human data, train a human model using behavioral cloning, and then use that
model to train &quot;human-aware&quot; agents (&quot;behavioral cloning play&quot;, or BCP). While
such an approach can improve the generalization of agents to new human
co-players, it involves the onerous and expensive step of collecting large
amounts of human data first. Here, we study the problem of how to train agents
that collaborate well with human partners without using human data. We argue
that the crux of the problem is to produce a diverse set of training partners.
Drawing inspiration from successful multi-agent approaches in competitive
domains, we find that a surprisingly simple approach is highly effective. We
train our agent partner as the best response to a population of self-play
agents and their past checkpoints taken throughout training, a method we call
Fictitious Co-Play (FCP). Our experiments focus on a two-player collaborative
cooking simulator that has recently been proposed as a challenge problem for
coordination with humans. We find that FCP agents score significantly higher
than SP, PP, and BCP when paired with novel agent and human partners.
Furthermore, humans also report a strong subjective preference to partnering
with FCP agents over all baselines.</span>

                    <span>Column generation is an iterative method used to solve a variety of
optimization problems. It decomposes the problem into two parts: a master
problem, and one or more pricing problems (PP). The total computing time taken
by the method is divided between these two parts. In routing or scheduling
applications, the problems are mostly defined on a network, and the PP is
usually an NP-hard shortest path problem with resource constraints. In this
work, we propose a new heuristic pricing algorithm based on machine learning.
By taking advantage of the data collected during previous executions, the
objective is to reduce the size of the network and accelerate the PP, keeping
only the arcs that have a high chance to be part of the linear relaxation
solution. The method has been applied to two specific problems: the vehicle and
crew scheduling problem in public transit and the vehicle routing problem with
time windows. Reductions in computational time of up to 40% can be obtained.</span>

                    <span>This article studies the estimation of community memberships from non-binary
pair interactions represented by an $N$-by-$N$ tensor whose values are elements
of $\mathcal S$, where $N$ is the number of nodes and $\mathcal S$ is the space
of the pairwise interactions between the nodes. As an information-theoretic
benchmark, we study data sets generated by a non-binary stochastic block model,
and derive fundamental information criteria for the recovery of the community
memberships as $N \to \infty$. Examples of applications include weighted
networks ($\mathcal S &#x3D; \mathbb R$), link-labeled networks $(\mathcal S &#x3D; \{0,
1, \dots, L\}$), multiplex networks $(\mathcal S &#x3D; \{0,1\}^M$) and temporal
networks ($\mathcal S &#x3D; \{0,1\}^T$).

For temporal interactions, we show that (i) even a small increase in $T$ may
have a big impact on the recovery of community memberships, (ii) consistent
recovery is possible even for very sparse data (e.g.\ bounded average degree)
when $T$ is large enough. We also present several estimation algorithms, both
offline and online, which fully utilise the temporal nature of the observed
data. We analyse the accuracy of the proposed estimation algorithms under
various assumptions on data sparsity and identifiability. Numerical experiments
show that even a poor initial estimate (e.g., blind random guess) of the
community assignment leads to high accuracy obtained by the online algorithm
after a small number of iterations, and remarkably so also in very sparse
regimes.</span>

                    <span>This paper proposes a novel acoustic word embedding called Acoustic Neighbor
Embeddings where speech or text of arbitrary length are mapped to a vector
space of fixed, reduced dimensions by adapting stochastic neighbor embedding
(SNE) to sequential inputs. The Euclidean distance between coordinates in the
embedding space reflects the phonetic confusability between their corresponding
sequences. Two encoder neural networks are trained: an acoustic encoder that
accepts speech signals in the form of frame-wise subword posterior
probabilities obtained from an acoustic model and a text encoder that accepts
text in the form of subword transcriptions. Compared to a triplet loss
criterion, the proposed method is shown to have more effective gradients for
neural network training. Experimentally, it also gives more accurate results
with low-dimensional embeddings when the two encoder networks are used in
tandem in a word (name) recognition task, and when the text encoder network is
used standalone in an approximate phonetic matching task. In particular, in an
isolated name recognition task depending solely on Euclidean nearest-neighbor
search between the proposed embedding vectors, the recognition accuracy is
identical to that of conventional finite state transducer(FST)-based decoding
using test data with up to 1 million names in the vocabulary and 40 dimensions
in the embeddings.</span>

                    <span>Deep reinforcement learning has gathered much attention recently. Impressive
results were achieved in activities as diverse as autonomous driving, game
playing, molecular recombination, and robotics. In all these fields, computer
programs have taught themselves to solve difficult problems. They have learned
to fly model helicopters and perform aerobatic manoeuvers such as loops and
rolls. In some applications they have even become better than the best humans,
such as in Atari, Go, poker and StarCraft. The way in which deep reinforcement
learning explores complex environments reminds us of how children learn, by
playfully trying out things, getting feedback, and trying again. The computer
seems to truly possess aspects of human learning; this goes to the heart of the
dream of artificial intelligence. The successes in research have not gone
unnoticed by educators, and universities have started to offer courses on the
subject. The aim of this book is to provide a comprehensive overview of the
field of deep reinforcement learning. The book is written for graduate students
of artificial intelligence, and for researchers and practitioners who wish to
better understand deep reinforcement learning methods and their challenges. We
assume an undergraduate-level of understanding of computer science and
artificial intelligence; the programming language of this book is Python. We
describe the foundations, the algorithms and the applications of deep
reinforcement learning. We cover the established model-free and model-based
methods that form the basis of the field. Developments go quickly, and we also
cover advanced topics: deep multi-agent reinforcement learning, deep
hierarchical reinforcement learning, and deep meta learning.</span>

                    <span>Extracting spatial-temporal knowledge from data is useful in many
applications. It is important that the obtained knowledge is
human-interpretable and amenable to formal analysis. In this paper, we propose
a method that trains neural networks to learn spatial-temporal properties in
the form of weighted graph-based signal temporal logic (wGSTL) formulas. For
learning wGSTL formulas, we introduce a flexible wGSTL formula structure in
which the user&#x27;s preference can be applied in the inferred wGSTL formulas. In
the proposed framework, each neuron of the neural networks corresponds to a
subformula in a flexible wGSTL formula structure. We initially train a neural
network to learn the wGSTL operators and then train a second neural network to
learn the parameters in a flexible wGSTL formula structure. We use a COVID-19
dataset and a rain prediction dataset to evaluate the performance of the
proposed framework and algorithms. We compare the performance of the proposed
framework with three baseline classification methods including K-nearest
neighbors, decision trees, support vector machine, and artificial neural
networks. The classification accuracy obtained by the proposed framework is
comparable with the baseline classification methods.</span>

variable. Despite the ubiquity of supervised and adversarial deep latent factor
models, these methods should demonstrate improvement over simpler linear
approaches to be preferred in practice. This necessitates a reproducible linear
analog that still adheres to an augmenting supervised or adversarial objective.
We address this methodological gap by presenting methods that augment the
principal component analysis (PCA) objective with either a supervised or an
adversarial objective and provide analytic and reproducible solutions. We
implement these methods in an open-source Python package, AugmentedPCA, that
can produce excellent real-world baselines. We demonstrate the utility of these
factor models on an open-source, RNA-seq cancer gene expression dataset,
showing that augmenting with a supervised objective results in improved
downstream classification performance, produces principal components with
greater class fidelity, and facilitates identification of genes aligned with
the principal axes of data variance with implications to development of
specific types of cancer.</span>

                    <span>Machine learning algorithms perform well on identifying patterns in many
different datasets due to their versatility. However, as one increases the size
of the dataset, the computation time for training and using these statistical
models grows quickly. Quantum computing offers a new paradigm which may have
the ability to overcome these computational difficulties. Here, we propose a
quantum analogue to K-means clustering, implement it on simulated
superconducting qubits, and compare it to a previously developed quantum
support vector machine. We find the algorithm&#x27;s accuracy comparable to the
classical K-means algorithm for clustering and classification problems, and
find that it has asymptotic complexity $O(N^{3/2}K^{1/2}\log{P})$, where $N$ is
the number of data points, $K$ is the number of clusters, and $P$ is the
dimension of the data points, giving a significant speedup over the classical
analogue.</span>

                    <span>This paper presents a new Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS) based on
Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). GNNs are a relatively new sub-field of deep
neural networks, which can leverage the inherent structure of graph-based data.
Training and evaluation data for NIDSs are typically represented as flow
records, which can naturally be represented in a graph format. In this paper,
we propose E-GraphSAGE, a GNN approach that allows capturing both the edge
features of a graph as well as the topological information for network
intrusion detection in IoT networks. To the best of our knowledge, our proposal
is the first successful, practical, and extensively evaluated approach of
applying GNNs on the problem of network intrusion detection for IoT using
flow-based data. Our extensive experimental evaluation on four recent NIDS
benchmark datasets shows that our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art in
terms of key classification metrics, which demonstrates the potential of GNNs
in network intrusion detection, and provides motivation for further research.</span>

                    <span>Time-varying vector fields produced by computational fluid dynamics
simulations are often prohibitively large and pose challenges for accurate
interactive analysis and exploration. To address these challenges, reduced
Lagrangian representations have been increasingly researched as a means to
improve scientific time-varying vector field exploration capabilities. This
paper presents a novel deep neural network-based particle tracing method to
explore time-varying vector fields represented by Lagrangian flow maps. In our
workflow, in situ processing is first utilized to extract Lagrangian flow maps,
and deep neural networks then use the extracted data to learn flow field
behavior. Using a trained model to predict new particle trajectories offers a
fixed small memory footprint and fast inference. To demonstrate and evaluate
the proposed method, we perform an in-depth study of performance using a
well-known analytical data set, the Double Gyre. Our study considers two flow
map extraction strategies as well as the impact of the number of training
samples and integration durations on efficacy, evaluates multiple sampling
options for training and testing and informs hyperparameter settings. Overall,
we find our method requires a fixed memory footprint of 10.5 MB to encode a
Lagrangian representation of a time-varying vector field while maintaining
accuracy. For post hoc analysis, loading the trained model costs only two
seconds, significantly reducing the burden of I/O when reading data for
visualization. Moreover, our parallel implementation can infer one hundred
locations for each of two thousand new pathlines across the entire temporal
resolution in 1.3 seconds using one NVIDIA Titan RTX GPU.</span>

                    <span>In this paper, we present connections between three models used in different
research fields: weighted finite automata~(WFA) from formal languages and
linguistics, recurrent neural networks used in machine learning, and tensor
networks which encompasses a set of optimization techniques for high-order
tensors used in quantum physics and numerical analysis. We first present an
intrinsic relation between WFA and the tensor train decomposition, a particular
form of tensor network. This relation allows us to exhibit a novel low rank
structure of the Hankel matrix of a function computed by a WFA and to design an
efficient spectral learning algorithm leveraging this structure to scale the
algorithm up to very large Hankel matrices.We then unravel a fundamental
connection between WFA and second-orderrecurrent neural networks~(2-RNN): in
the case of sequences of discrete symbols, WFA and 2-RNN with linear
activationfunctions are expressively equivalent. Leveraging this equivalence
result combined with the classical spectral learning algorithm for weighted
automata, we introduce the first provable learning algorithm for linear 2-RNN
defined over sequences of continuous input vectors.This algorithm relies on
estimating low rank sub-blocks of the Hankel tensor, from which the parameters
of a linear 2-RNN can be provably recovered. The performances of the proposed
learning algorithm are assessed in a simulation study on both synthetic and
real-world data.</span>

from the perspective of statistical learning theory, modelled, in a simplified
setting, as a continuous-time stochastic recurrent neural network (RNN) with
identity activation function. In the purely stochastic (robust) regime, we give
a generalisation error bound that holds with high probability, thus showing
that the empirical risk minimiser is the best-in-class hypothesis. We show that
RNNs retain a partial signature of the paths they are fed as the unique
information exploited for training and classification tasks. We argue that
these RNNs are easy to train and robust and back these observations with

                    <span>Numerical models based on physics represent the state-of-the-art in earth
system modeling and comprise our best tools for generating insights and
predictions. Despite rapid growth in computational power, the perceived need
for higher model resolutions overwhelms the latest-generation computers,
reducing the ability of modelers to generate simulations for understanding
parameter sensitivities and characterizing variability and uncertainty. Thus,
surrogate models are often developed to capture the essential attributes of the
full-blown numerical models. Recent successes of machine learning methods,
especially deep learning, across many disciplines offer the possibility that
complex nonlinear connectionist representations may be able to capture the
underlying complex structures and nonlinear processes in earth systems. A
difficult test for deep learning-based emulation, which refers to function
approximation of numerical models, is to understand whether they can be
comparable to traditional forms of surrogate models in terms of computational
efficiency while simultaneously reproducing model results in a credible manner.
A deep learning emulation that passes this test may be expected to perform even
better than simple models with respect to capturing complex processes and
spatiotemporal dependencies. Here we examine, with a case study in
satellite-based remote sensing, the hypothesis that deep learning approaches
can credibly represent the simulations from a surrogate model with comparable
computational efficiency. Our results are encouraging in that the deep learning
emulation reproduces the results with acceptable accuracy and often even faster
performance. We discuss the broader implications of our results in light of the
pace of improvements in high-performance implementations of deep learning as
well as the growing desire for higher-resolution simulations in the earth
sciences.</span>

                    <span>Identifying the status of individual network units is critical for
understanding the mechanism of convolutional neural networks (CNNs). However,
it is still challenging to reliably give a general indication of unit status,
especially for units in different network models. To this end, we propose a
novel method for quantitatively clarifying the status of single unit in CNN
using algebraic topological tools. Unit status is indicated via the calculation
of a defined topological-based entropy, called feature entropy, which measures
the degree of chaos of the global spatial pattern hidden in the unit for a
category. In this way, feature entropy could provide an accurate indication of
status for units in different networks with diverse situations like
weight-rescaling operation. Further, we show that feature entropy decreases as
the layer goes deeper and shares almost simultaneous trend with loss during
training. We show that by investigating the feature entropy of units on only
training data, it could give discrimination between networks with different
generalization ability from the view of the effectiveness of feature
representations.</span>

                    <span>Quantum noise is the key challenge in Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ)
computers. Previous work for mitigating noise has primarily focused on
gate-level or pulse-level noise-adaptive compilation. However, limited research
efforts have explored a higher level of optimization by making the quantum
circuits themselves resilient to noise.

We propose QuantumNAS, a comprehensive framework for noise-adaptive co-search
of the variational circuit and qubit mapping. Variational quantum circuits are
a promising approach for constructing QML and quantum simulation. However,
finding the best variational circuit and its optimal parameters is challenging
due to the large design space and parameter training cost. We propose to
decouple the circuit search and parameter training by introducing a novel
SuperCircuit. The SuperCircuit is constructed with multiple layers of
pre-defined parameterized gates and trained by iteratively sampling and
updating the parameter subsets (SubCircuits) of it. It provides an accurate
estimation of SubCircuits performance trained from scratch. Then we perform an
evolutionary co-search of SubCircuit and its qubit mapping. The SubCircuit
performance is estimated with parameters inherited from SuperCircuit and
simulated with real device noise models. Finally, we perform iterative gate
pruning and finetuning to remove redundant gates.

Extensively evaluated with 12 QML and VQE benchmarks on 14 quantum computers,
QuantumNAS significantly outperforms baselines. For QML, QuantumNAS is the
first to demonstrate over 95% 2-class, 85% 4-class, and 32% 10-class
classification accuracy on real QC. It also achieves the lowest eigenvalue for
VQE tasks on H2, H2O, LiH, CH4, BeH2 compared with UCCSD. We also open-source
TorchQuantum (https://github.com/mit-han-lab/torchquantum) for fast training of
parameterized quantum circuits to facilitate future research.</span>

                    <span>Federated learning is a form of distributed learning with the key challenge
being the non-identically distributed nature of the data in the participating
clients. In this paper, we extend federated learning to the setting where
multiple unrelated models are trained simultaneously. Specifically, every
client is able to train any one of M models at a time and the server maintains
a model for each of the M models which is typically a suitably averaged version
of the model computed by the clients. We propose multiple policies for
assigning learning tasks to clients over time. In the first policy, we extend
the widely studied FedAvg to multi-model learning by allotting models to
clients in an i.i.d. stochastic manner. In addition, we propose two new
policies for client selection in a multi-model federated setting which make
decisions based on current local losses for each client-model pair. We compare
the performance of the policies on tasks involving synthetic and real-world
data and characterize the performance of the proposed policies. The key
take-away from our work is that the proposed multi-model policies perform
better or at least as good as single model training using FedAvg.</span>

                    <span>Using only global annotations such as the image class labels,
weakly-supervised learning methods allow CNN classifiers to jointly classify an
image, and yield the regions of interest associated with the predicted class.
However, without any guidance at the pixel level, such methods may yield
inaccurate regions. This problem is known to be more challenging with histology
images than with natural ones, since objects are less salient, structures have
more variations, and foreground and background regions have stronger
similarities. Therefore, methods in computer vision literature for visual
interpretation of CNNs may not directly apply. In this work, we propose a
simple yet efficient method based on a composite loss function that leverages
information from the fully negative samples. Our new loss function contains two
complementary terms: the first exploits positive evidence collected from the
CNN classifier, while the second leverages the fully negative samples from the
training dataset. In particular, we equip a pre-trained classifier with a
decoder that allows refining the regions of interest. The same classifier is
exploited to collect both the positive and negative evidence at the pixel level
to train the decoder. This enables to take advantages of the fully negative
samples that occurs naturally in the data, without any additional supervision
signals and using only the image class as supervision. Compared to several
recent related methods, over the public benchmark GlaS for colon cancer and a
Camelyon16 patch-based benchmark for breast cancer using three different
backbones, we show the substantial improvements introduced by our method. Our
results shows the benefits of using both negative and positive evidence, ie,
the one obtained from a classifier and the one naturally available in datasets.
We provide an ablation study of both terms. Our code is publicly available.</span>

                    <span>We introduce a novel masked graph autoencoder (MGAE) framework to perform
effective learning on graph structure data. Taking insights from
self-supervised learning, we randomly mask a large proportion of edges and try
to reconstruct these missing edges during training. MGAE has two core designs.
First, we find that masking a high ratio of the input graph structure, e.g.,
$70\%$, yields a nontrivial and meaningful self-supervisory task that benefits
downstream applications. Second, we employ a graph neural network (GNN) as an
encoder to perform message propagation on the partially-masked graph. To
reconstruct the large number of masked edges, a tailored cross-correlation
decoder is proposed. It could capture the cross-correlation between the head
and tail nodes of anchor edge in multi-granularity. Coupling these two designs
enables MGAE to be trained efficiently and effectively. Extensive experiments
on multiple open datasets (Planetoid and OGB benchmarks) demonstrate that MGAE
generally performs better than state-of-the-art unsupervised learning
competitors on link prediction and node classification.</span>

                    <span>We contribute to a better understanding of the class of functions that is
represented by a neural network with ReLU activations and a given architecture.
Using techniques from mixed-integer optimization, polyhedral theory, and
tropical geometry, we provide a mathematical counterbalance to the universal
approximation theorems which suggest that a single hidden layer is sufficient
for learning tasks. In particular, we investigate whether the class of exactly
representable functions strictly increases by adding more layers (with no
restrictions on size). This problem has potential impact on algorithmic and
statistical aspects because of the insight it provides into the class of
functions represented by neural hypothesis classes. However, to the best of our
knowledge, this question has not been investigated in the neural network
literature. We also present upper bounds on the sizes of neural networks
required to represent functions in these neural hypothesis classes.</span>

                    <span>This paper tackles the problem of few-shot learning, which aims to learn new
visual concepts from a few examples. A common problem setting in few-shot
classification assumes random sampling strategy in acquiring data labels, which
is inefficient in practical applications. In this work, we introduce a new
budget-aware few-shot learning problem that not only aims to learn novel object
categories, but also needs to select informative examples to annotate in order
to achieve data efficiency.

We develop a meta-learning strategy for our budget-aware few-shot learning
task, which jointly learns a novel data selection policy based on a Graph
Convolutional Network (GCN) and an example-based few-shot classifier. Our
selection policy computes a context-sensitive representation for each unlabeled
data by graph message passing, which is then used to predict an informativeness
score for sequential selection. We validate our method by extensive experiments
on the mini-ImageNet, tiered-ImageNet and Omniglot datasets. The results show
our few-shot learning strategy outperforms baselines by a sizable margin, which
demonstrates the efficacy of our method.</span>

                    <span>Clustering is a fundamental primitive in unsupervised learning which gives
rise to a rich class of computationally-challenging inference tasks. In this
work, we focus on the canonical task of clustering d-dimensional Gaussian
mixtures with unknown (and possibly degenerate) covariance. Recent works (Ghosh
et al. &#x27;20; Mao, Wein &#x27;21; Davis, Diaz, Wang &#x27;21) have established lower bounds
against the class of low-degree polynomial methods and the sum-of-squares (SoS)
hierarchy for recovering certain hidden structures planted in Gaussian
clustering instances. Prior work on many similar inference tasks portends that
such lower bounds strongly suggest the presence of an inherent
statistical-to-computational gap for clustering, that is, a parameter regime
where the clustering task is statistically possible but no polynomial-time
algorithm succeeds.

One special case of the clustering task we consider is equivalent to the
problem of finding a planted hypercube vector in an otherwise random subspace.
We show that, perhaps surprisingly, this particular clustering model does not
exhibit a statistical-to-computational gap, even though the aforementioned
low-degree and SoS lower bounds continue to apply in this case. To achieve
this, we give a polynomial-time algorithm based on the Lenstra--Lenstra--Lovasz
lattice basis reduction method which achieves the statistically-optimal sample
complexity of d+1 samples. This result extends the class of problems whose
conjectured statistical-to-computational gaps can be &quot;closed&quot; by &quot;brittle&quot;
polynomial-time algorithms, highlighting the crucial but subtle role of noise
in the onset of statistical-to-computational gaps.</span>

                    <span>Many fundamental problems in data mining can be reduced to one or more
NP-hard combinatorial optimization problems. Recent advances in novel
technologies such as quantum and quantum-inspired hardware promise a
substantial speedup for solving these problems compared to when using general
purpose computers but often require the problem to be modeled in a special
form, such as an Ising or quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO)
model, in order to take advantage of these devices. In this work, we focus on
the important binary matrix factorization (BMF) problem which has many
applications in data mining. We propose two QUBO formulations for BMF. We show
how clustering constraints can easily be incorporated into these formulations.
The special purpose hardware we consider is limited in the number of variables
it can handle which presents a challenge when factorizing large matrices. We
propose a sampling based approach to overcome this challenge, allowing us to
factorize large rectangular matrices. In addition to these methods, we also
propose a simple baseline algorithm which outperforms our more sophisticated
methods in a few situations. We run experiments on the Fujitsu Digital
Annealer, a quantum-inspired complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS)
annealer, on both synthetic and real data, including gene expression data.
These experiments show that our approach is able to produce more accurate BMFs
than competing methods.</span>

                    <span>The similarity between objects is significant in a broad range of areas.
While similarity can be measured using off-the-shelf distance functions, they
may fail to capture the inherent meaning of similarity, which tends to depend
on the underlying data and task. Moreover, conventional distance functions
limit the space of similarity measures to be symmetric and do not directly
allow comparing objects from different spaces. We propose using quantum
networks (GQSim) for learning task-dependent (a)symmetric similarity between
data that need not have the same dimensionality. We analyze the properties of
such similarity function analytically (for a simple case) and numerically (for
a complex case) and showthat these similarity measures can extract salient
features of the data. We also demonstrate that the similarity measure derived
using this technique is $(\epsilon,\gamma,\tau)$-good, resulting in
theoretically guaranteed performance. Finally, we conclude by applying this
technique for three relevant applications - Classification, Graph Completion,
Generative modeling.</span>

unexpected items in a given data set of time series type. We present
applications of signature or randomized signature as feature extractors for
anomaly detection algorithms; additionally we provide an easy, representation
theoretic justification for the construction of randomized signatures. Our
first application is based on synthetic data and aims at distinguishing between
real and fake trajectories of stock prices, which are indistinguishable by
visual inspection. We also show a real life application by using transaction
data from the cryptocurrency market. In this case, we are able to identify pump

means of our unsupervised learning algorithm, thus achieving results that are
close to the state-of-the-art in the field based on supervised learning.</span>

                    <span>Markov chains with variable length are useful parsimonious stochastic models
able to generate most stationary sequence of discrete symbols. The idea is to
identify the suffixes of the past, called contexts, that are relevant to
predict the future symbol. Sometimes a single state is a context, and looking
at the past and finding this specific state makes the further past irrelevant.
States with such property are called renewal states and they can be used to
split the chain into independent and identically distributed blocks. In order
to identify renewal states for chains with variable length, we propose the use
of Intrinsic Bayes Factor to evaluate the hypothesis that some particular state
is a renewal state. In this case, the difficulty lies in integrating the
marginal posterior distribution for the random context trees for general prior
distribution on the space of context trees, with Dirichlet prior for the
transition probabilities, and Monte Carlo methods are applied. To show the
strength of our method, we analyzed artificial datasets generated from
different binary models models and one example coming from the field of
Linguistics.</span>

                    <span>State-of-the-art stereo matching networks trained only on synthetic data
often fail to generalize to more challenging real data domains. In this paper,
we attempt to unfold an important factor that hinders the networks from
generalizing across domains: through the lens of shortcut learning. We
demonstrate that the learning of feature representations in stereo matching
networks is heavily influenced by synthetic data artefacts (shortcut
attributes). To mitigate this issue, we propose an Information-Theoretic
Shortcut Avoidance~(ITSA) approach to automatically restrict shortcut-related
information from being encoded into the feature representations. As a result,
our proposed method learns robust and shortcut-invariant features by minimizing
the sensitivity of latent features to input variations. To avoid the
prohibitive computational cost of direct input sensitivity optimization, we
propose an effective yet feasible algorithm to achieve robustness. We show that
using this method, state-of-the-art stereo matching networks that are trained
purely on synthetic data can effectively generalize to challenging and
previously unseen real data scenarios. Importantly, the proposed method
enhances the robustness of the synthetic trained networks to the point that
they outperform their fine-tuned counterparts (on real data) for challenging
out-of-domain stereo datasets.</span>

                    <span>We develop the &quot;generalized consistent weighted sampling&quot; (GCWS) for hashing
the &quot;powered-GMM&quot; (pGMM) kernel (with a tuning parameter $p$). It turns out
that GCWS provides a numerically stable scheme for applying power
transformation on the original data, regardless of the magnitude of $p$ and the
data. The power transformation is often effective for boosting the performance,
in many cases considerably so. We feed the hashed data to neural networks on a
variety of public classification datasets and name our method &#x60;&#x60;GCWSNet&#x27;&#x27;. Our
extensive experiments show that GCWSNet often improves the classification
accuracy. Furthermore, it is evident from the experiments that GCWSNet
converges substantially faster. In fact, GCWS often reaches a reasonable
accuracy with merely (less than) one epoch of the training process. This
property is much desired because many applications, such as advertisement
click-through rate (CTR) prediction models, or data streams (i.e., data seen
only once), often train just one epoch. Another beneficial side effect is that
the computations of the first layer of the neural networks become additions
instead of multiplications because the input data become binary (and highly
sparse).

Empirical comparisons with (normalized) random Fourier features (NRFF) are
provided. We also propose to reduce the model size of GCWSNet by count-sketch
and develop the theory for analyzing the impact of using count-sketch on the
accuracy of GCWS. Our analysis shows that an &#x60;&#x60;8-bit&#x27;&#x27; strategy should work
well in that we can always apply an 8-bit count-sketch hashing on the output of
GCWS hashing without hurting the accuracy much. There are many other ways to
take advantage of GCWS when training deep neural networks. For example, one can
apply GCWS on the outputs of the last layer to boost the accuracy of trained
deep neural networks.</span>

approximate even in the single-component case. In this paper we settle the
computational complexity of sparse PCA with respect to the rank of the
covariance matrix. We show that, if the rank of the covariance matrix is a
fixed value, then there is an algorithm that solves sparse PCA to global
optimality, whose running time is polynomial in the number of features. We also
prove a similar result for the version of sparse PCA which requires the
principal components to have disjoint supports.</span>

                    <span>An important problem in causal inference is to break down the total effect of
a treatment on an outcome into different causal pathways and to quantify the
causal effect in each pathway. For instance, in causal fairness, the total
effect of being a male employee (i.e., treatment) constitutes its direct effect
on annual income (i.e., outcome) and the indirect effect via the employee&#x27;s
occupation (i.e., mediator). Causal mediation analysis (CMA) is a formal
statistical framework commonly used to reveal such underlying causal
mechanisms. One major challenge of CMA in observational studies is handling
confounders, variables that cause spurious causal relationships among
treatment, mediator, and outcome. Conventional methods assume sequential
ignorability that implies all confounders can be measured, which is often
unverifiable in practice. This work aims to circumvent the stringent sequential
ignorability assumptions and consider hidden confounders. Drawing upon proxy
strategies and recent advances in deep learning, we propose to simultaneously
uncover the latent variables that characterize hidden confounders and estimate
the causal effects. Empirical evaluations using both synthetic and
semi-synthetic datasets validate the effectiveness of the proposed method. We
further show the potentials of our approach for causal fairness analysis.</span>

                    <span>The similarity of feature representations plays a pivotal role in the success
of problems related to domain adaptation. Feature similarity includes both the
invariance of marginal distributions and the closeness of conditional
distributions given the desired response $y$ (e.g., class labels).
Unfortunately, traditional methods always learn such features without fully
taking into consideration the information in $y$, which in turn may lead to a
mismatch of the conditional distributions or the mix-up of discriminative
structures underlying data distributions. In this work, we introduce the
recently proposed von Neumann conditional divergence to improve the
transferability across multiple domains. We show that this new divergence is
differentiable and eligible to easily quantify the functional dependence
between features and $y$. Given multiple source tasks, we integrate this
divergence to capture discriminative information in $y$ and design novel
learning objectives assuming those source tasks are observed either
simultaneously or sequentially. In both scenarios, we obtain favorable
performance against state-of-the-art methods in terms of smaller generalization
error on new tasks and less catastrophic forgetting on source tasks (in the
sequential setup).</span>

Cognitive Maps (FCM) have shown remarkable results as a tool to model and
analyze the dynamics of complex systems. FCM have similarities to recurrent
neural networks and can be classified as a neuro-fuzzy method. In other words,
FCMs are a mixture of fuzzy logic, neural network, and expert system aspects,
which act as a powerful tool for simulating and studying the dynamic behavior
of complex systems. The most interesting features are knowledge
interpretability, dynamic characteristics and learning capability. The goal of
this survey paper is mainly to present an overview on the most relevant and
recent FCM-based time series forecasting models proposed in the literature. In
addition, this article considers an introduction on the fundamentals of FCM
model and learning methodologies. Also, this survey provides some ideas for
future research to enhance the capabilities of FCM in order to cover some
challenges in the real-world experiments such as handling non-stationary data
and scalability issues. Moreover, equipping FCMs with fast learning algorithms

                    <span>Adversarial bit-flip attack (BFA) on Neural Network weights can result in
catastrophic accuracy degradation by flipping a very small number of bits. A
major drawback of prior bit flip attack techniques is their reliance on test
data. This is frequently not possible for applications that contain sensitive
or proprietary data. In this paper, we propose Blind Data Adversarial Bit-flip
Attack (BDFA), a novel technique to enable BFA without any access to the
training or testing data. This is achieved by optimizing for a synthetic
dataset, which is engineered to match the statistics of batch normalization
across different layers of the network and the targeted label. Experimental
results show that BDFA could decrease the accuracy of ResNet50 significantly
from 75.96\% to 13.94\% with only 4 bits flips.</span>

                    <span>Recent advances in deep learning have led to a paradigm shift in reversible
steganography. A fundamental pillar of reversible steganography is predictive
modelling which can be realised via deep neural networks. However, non-trivial
errors exist in inferences about some out-of-distribution and noisy data. In
view of this issue, we propose to consider uncertainty in predictive models
based upon a theoretical framework of Bayesian deep learning. Bayesian neural
networks can be regarded as self-aware machinery; that is, a machine that knows
its own limitations. To quantify uncertainty, we approximate the posterior
predictive distribution through Monte Carlo sampling with stochastic forward
passes. We further show that predictive uncertainty can be disentangled into
aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties and these quantities can be learnt in an
unsupervised manner. Experimental results demonstrate an improvement delivered
by Bayesian uncertainty analysis upon steganographic capacity-distortion
performance.</span>

                    <span>Data scientists and statisticians are often at odds when determining the best
approach, machine learning or statistical modeling, to solve an analytics
challenge. However, machine learning and statistical modeling are more cousins
than adversaries on different sides of an analysis battleground. Choosing
between the two approaches or in some cases using both is based on the problem
to be solved and outcomes required as well as the data available for use and
circumstances of the analysis. Machine learning and statistical modeling are
complementary, based on similar mathematical principles, but simply using
different tools in an overall analytics knowledge base. Determining the
predominant approach should be based on the problem to be solved as well as
empirical evidence, such as size and completeness of the data, number of
variables, assumptions or lack thereof, and expected outcomes such as
predictions or causality. Good analysts and data scientists should be well
versed in both techniques and their proper application, thereby using the right
tool for the right project to achieve the desired results.</span>

                    <span>Neural networks-based learning of the distribution of non-dispatchable
renewable electricity generation from sources such as photovoltaics (PV) and
wind as well as load demands has recently gained attention. Normalizing flow
density models are particularly well suited for this task due to the training
through direct log-likelihood maximization. However, research from the field of
image generation has shown that standard normalizing flows can only learn
smeared-out versions of manifold distributions. Previous works on normalizing
flow-based scenario generation do not address this issue, and the smeared-out
distributions result in the sampling of noisy time series. In this paper, we
exploit the isometry of the principal component analysis (PCA), which sets up
the normalizing flow in a lower-dimensional space while maintaining the direct
and computationally efficient likelihood maximization. We train the resulting
principal component flow (PCF) on data of PV and wind power generation as well
as load demand in Germany in the years 2013 to 2015. The results of this
investigation show that the PCF preserves critical features of the original
distributions, such as the probability density and frequency behavior of the
time series. The application of the PCF is, however, not limited to renewable
power generation but rather extends to any data set, time series, or otherwise,
which can be efficiently reduced using PCA.</span>

Student prior is exploited to favour the underlying low-rank structure of the
data matrix. We provide a thorough theoretical investigation for our approach
through PAC-Bayesian bounds. More precisely, our PAC-Bayesian approach enjoys a
minimax-optimal oracle inequality which guarantees that our method works well
under model misspecification and under general sampling distribution.
Interestingly, we also provide efficient gradient-based sampling
implementations for our approach by using Langevin Monte Carlo. More
specifically, we show that our algorithms are significantly faster than Gibbs
sampler in this problem. To illustrate the attractive features of our inference
strategy, some numerical simulations are conducted and an application to image
inpainting is demonstrated.</span>

                    <span>Visual localization tackles the challenge of estimating the camera pose from
images by using correspondence analysis between query images and a map. This
task is computation and data intensive which poses challenges on thorough
evaluation of methods on various datasets. However, in order to further advance
in the field, we claim that robust visual localization algorithms should be
evaluated on multiple datasets covering a broad domain variety. To facilitate
this, we introduce kapture, a new, flexible, unified data format and toolbox
for visual localization and structure-from-motion (SFM). It enables easy usage
of different datasets as well as efficient and reusable data processing. To
demonstrate this, we present a versatile pipeline for visual localization that
facilitates the use of different local and global features, 3D data (e.g. depth
maps), non-vision sensor data (e.g. IMU, GPS, WiFi), and various processing
algorithms. Using multiple configurations of the pipeline, we show the great
versatility of kapture in our experiments. Furthermore, we evaluate our methods
on eight public datasets where they rank top on all and first on many of them.
To foster future research, we release code, models, and all datasets used in
this paper in the kapture format open source under a permissive BSD license.

                    <span>Advances in the motor imagery (MI)-based brain-computer interfaces (BCIs)
allow control of several applications by decoding neurophysiological phenomena,
which are usually recorded by electroencephalography (EEG) using a non-invasive
technique. Despite great advances in MI-based BCI, EEG rhythms are specific to
a subject and various changes over time. These issues point to significant
challenges to enhance the classification performance, especially in a
subject-independent manner. To overcome these challenges, we propose MIN2Net, a
novel end-to-end multi-task learning to tackle this task. We integrate deep
metric learning into a multi-task autoencoder to learn a compact and
discriminative latent representation from EEG and perform classification
simultaneously. This approach reduces the complexity in pre-processing, results
in significant performance improvement on EEG classification. Experimental
results in a subject-independent manner show that MIN2Net outperforms the
state-of-the-art techniques, achieving an F1-score improvement of 6.72%, and
2.23% on the SMR-BCI, and OpenBMI datasets, respectively. We demonstrate that
MIN2Net improves discriminative information in the latent representation. This
study indicates the possibility and practicality of using this model to develop
MI-based BCI applications for new users without the need for calibration.</span>

                    <span>Federated learning trains models across devices with distributed data, while
protecting the privacy and obtaining a model similar to that of centralized ML.
A large number of workers with data and computing power are the foundation of
federal learning. However, the inevitable costs prevent self-interested workers
from serving for free. Moreover, due to data isolation, task publishers lack
effective methods to select, evaluate and pay reliable workers with
high-quality data. Therefore, we design an auction-based incentive mechanism
for horizontal federated learning with reputation and contribution measurement.
By designing a reasonable method of measuring contribution, we establish the
reputation of workers, which is easy to decline and difficult to improve.
Through reverse auctions, workers bid for tasks, and the task publisher selects
workers combining reputation and bid price. With the budget constraint, winning
workers are paid based on performance. We proved that our mechanism satisfies
the individual rationality of the honest worker, budget feasibility,
truthfulness, and computational efficiency.</span>

                    <span>Representation learning from unlabeled data has been of major interest in
artificial intelligence research. While self-supervised speech representation
learning has been popular in the speech research community, very few works have
comprehensively analyzed audio representation learning for non-speech audio
tasks. In this paper, we propose a self-supervised audio representation
learning method and apply it to a variety of downstream non-speech audio tasks.
We combine the well-known wav2vec 2.0 framework, which has shown success in
self-supervised learning for speech tasks, with parameter-efficient conformer
architectures. Our self-supervised pre-training can reduce the need for labeled
data by two-thirds. On the AudioSet benchmark, we achieve a mean average
precision (mAP) score of 0.415, which is a new state-of-the-art on this dataset
through audio-only self-supervised learning. Our fine-tuned conformers also
surpass or match the performance of previous systems pre-trained in a
supervised way on several downstream tasks. We further discuss the important
design considerations for both pre-training and fine-tuning.</span>

                    <span>Reward design is a fundamental problem in reinforcement learning (RL). A
misspecified or poorly designed reward can result in low sample efficiency and
undesired behaviors. In this paper, we propose the idea of programmatic reward
design, i.e. using programs to specify the reward functions in RL environments.
Programs allow human engineers to express sub-goals and complex task scenarios
in a structured and interpretable way. The challenge of programmatic reward
design, however, is that while humans can provide the high-level structures,
properly setting the low-level details, such as the right amount of reward for
a specific sub-task, remains difficult. A major contribution of this paper is a
probabilistic framework that can infer the best candidate programmatic reward
function from expert demonstrations. Inspired by recent generative-adversarial
approaches, our framework searches for the most likely programmatic reward
function under which the optimally generated trajectories cannot be
differentiated from the demonstrated trajectories. Experimental results show
that programmatic reward functionslearned using this framework can
significantly outperform those learned using existing reward learning
algo-rithms, and enable RL agents to achieve state-of-the-artperformance on
highly complex tasks.</span>

                    <span>Traffic signal control is an important problem in urban mobility with a
significant potential of economic and environmental impact. While there is a
growing interest in Reinforcement Learning (RL) for traffic control, the work
so far has focussed on learning through interactions which, in practice, is
costly. Instead, real experience data on traffic is available and could be
exploited at minimal costs. Recent progress in offline or batch RL has enabled
just that. Model-based offline RL methods, in particular, have been shown to
generalize to the experience data much better than others. We build a
model-based learning framework, A-DAC, which infers a Markov Decision Process
(MDP) from dataset with pessimistic costs built in to deal with data
uncertainties. The costs are modeled through an adaptive shaping of rewards in
the MDP which provides better regularization of data compared to the prior
related work. A-DAC is evaluated on a complex signalized roundabout using
multiple datasets varying in size and in batch collection policy. The
evaluation results show that it is possible to build high performance control
policies in a data efficient manner using simplistic batch collection policies.</span>

                    <span>The El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) is a semi-periodic fluctuation in sea
surface temperature (SST) over the tropical central and eastern Pacific Ocean
that influences interannual variability in regional hydrology across the world
through long-range dependence or teleconnections. Recent research has
demonstrated the value of Deep Learning (DL) methods for improving ENSO
prediction as well as Complex Networks (CN) for understanding teleconnections.
However, gaps in predictive understanding of ENSO-driven river flows include
the black box nature of DL, the use of simple ENSO indices to describe a
complex phenomenon and translating DL-based ENSO predictions to river flow
predictions. Here we show that eXplainable DL (XDL) methods, based on saliency
maps, can extract interpretable predictive information contained in global SST
and discover novel SST information regions and dependence structures relevant
for river flows which, in tandem with climate network constructions, enable
improved predictive understanding. Our results reveal additional information
content in global SST beyond ENSO indices, develop new understanding of how
SSTs influence river flows, and generate improved river flow predictions with
uncertainties. Observations, reanalysis data, and earth system model
simulations are used to demonstrate the value of the XDL-CN based methods for
future interannual and decadal scale climate projections.</span>

                    <span>In business retention, churn prevention has always been a major concern. This
work contributes to this domain by formalizing the problem of churn prediction
in the context of online gambling as a binary classification task. We also
propose an algorithmic answer to this problem based on recurrent neural
network. This algorithm is tested with online gambling data that have the form
of time series, which can be efficiently processed by recurrent neural
networks. To evaluate the performances of the trained models, standard machine
learning metrics were used, such as accuracy, precision and recall. For this
problem in particular, the conducted experiments allowed to assess that the
choice of a specific architecture depends on the metric which is given the
greatest importance. Architectures using nBRC favour precision, those using
LSTM give better recall, while GRU-based architectures allow a higher accuracy
and balance two other metrics. Moreover, further experiments showed that using
only the more recent time-series histories to train the networks decreases the
quality of the results. We also study the performances of models learned at a
specific instant $t$, at other times $t^{\prime} &gt; t$. The results show that
the performances of the models learned at time $t$ remain good at the following
instants $t^{\prime} &gt; t$, suggesting that there is no need to refresh the
models at a high rate. However, the performances of the models were subject to
noticeable variance due to one-off events impacting the data.</span>

                    <span>Machine learning methods such as deep neural networks (DNNs), despite their
success across different domains, are known to often generate incorrect
predictions with high confidence on inputs outside their training distribution.
The deployment of DNNs in safety-critical domains requires detection of
out-of-distribution (OOD) data so that DNNs can abstain from making predictions
on those. A number of methods have been recently developed for OOD detection,
but there is still room for improvement. We propose the new method iDECODe,
leveraging in-distribution equivariance for conformal OOD detection. It relies
on a novel base non-conformity measure and a new aggregation method, used in
the inductive conformal anomaly detection framework, thereby guaranteeing a
bounded false detection rate. We demonstrate the efficacy of iDECODe by
experiments on image and audio datasets, obtaining state-of-the-art results. We
also show that iDECODe can detect adversarial examples.</span>

                    <span>We introduce a new general-purpose approach to deep learning on 3D surfaces,
based on the insight that a simple diffusion layer is highly effective for
spatial communication. The resulting networks are automatically robust to
changes in resolution and sampling of a surface -- a basic property which is
crucial for practical applications. Our networks can be discretized on various
geometric representations such as triangle meshes or point clouds, and can even
be trained on one representation then applied to another. We optimize the
spatial support of diffusion as a continuous network parameter ranging from
purely local to totally global, removing the burden of manually choosing
neighborhood sizes. The only other ingredients in the method are a multi-layer
perceptron applied independently at each point, and spatial gradient features
to support directional filters. The resulting networks are simple, robust, and
efficient. Here, we focus primarily on triangle mesh surfaces, and demonstrate
state-of-the-art results for a variety of tasks including surface
classification, segmentation, and non-rigid correspondence.</span>

                    <span>Federated learning (FL) is an emerging privacy-preserving distributed
learning scheme. Due to the large model size and frequent model aggregation, FL
suffers from critical communication bottleneck. Many techniques have been
proposed to reduce the communication volume, including model compression and
quantization. Existing adaptive quantization schemes use ascending-trend
quantization where the quantizaion level increases with the training stages. In
this paper, we formulate the problem as optimizing the training convergence
rate for a given communication volume. The result shows that the optimal
quantizaiton level can be represented by two factors, i.e., the training loss
and the range of model updates, and it is preferable to decrease the
quantization level rather than increase. Then, we propose two descending
quantization schemes based on the training loss and model range. Experimental
results show that proposed schemes not only reduce the communication volume but
also help FL converge faster, when compared with current ascending
quantization.</span>

                    <span>Humans race drones faster than neural networks trained for end-to-end
autonomous flight. This may be related to the ability of human pilots to select
task-relevant visual information effectively. This work investigates whether
neural networks capable of imitating human eye gaze behavior and attention can
improve neural network performance for the challenging task of vision-based
autonomous drone racing. We hypothesize that gaze-based attention prediction
can be an efficient mechanism for visual information selection and decision
making in a simulator-based drone racing task. We test this hypothesis using
eye gaze and flight trajectory data from 18 human drone pilots to train a
visual attention prediction model. We then use this visual attention prediction
model to train an end-to-end controller for vision-based autonomous drone
racing using imitation learning. We compare the drone racing performance of the
attention-prediction controller to those using raw image inputs and image-based
abstractions (i.e., feature tracks). Our results show that attention-prediction
based controllers outperform the baselines and are able to complete a
challenging race track consistently with up to 88% success rate. Furthermore,
visual attention-prediction and feature-track based models showed better
generalization performance than image-based models when evaluated on hold-out
reference trajectories. Our results demonstrate that human visual attention
prediction improves the performance of autonomous vision-based drone racing
agents and provides an essential step towards vision-based, fast, and agile
autonomous flight that eventually can reach and even exceed human performances.</span>

                    <span>Motivation: Protein-protein interactions (PPI) are critical to the function
of proteins in both normal and diseased cells, and many critical protein
functions are mediated by interactions.Knowledge of the nature of these
interactions is important for the construction of networks to analyse
biological data. However, only a small percentage of PPIs captured in protein
interaction databases have annotations of function available, e.g. only 4% of
PPI are functionally annotated in the IntAct database. Here, we aim to label
the function type of PPIs by extracting relationships described in PubMed
abstracts.

Method: We create a weakly supervised dataset from the IntAct PPI database
containing interacting protein pairs with annotated function and associated
abstracts from the PubMed database. We apply a state-of-the-art deep learning
technique for biomedical natural language processing tasks, BioBERT, to build a
model - dubbed PPI-BioBERT - for identifying the function of PPIs. In order to
extract high quality PPI functions at large scale, we use an ensemble of
PPI-BioBERT models to improve uncertainty estimation and apply an interaction
type-specific threshold to counteract the effects of variations in the number
of training samples per interaction type.

Results: We scan 18 million PubMed abstracts to automatically identify 3253
new typed PPIs, including phosphorylation and acetylation interactions, with an
overall precision of 46% (87% for acetylation) based on a human-reviewed
sample. This work demonstrates that analysis of biomedical abstracts for PPI
function extraction is a feasible approach to substantially increasing the
number of interactions annotated with function captured in online databases.</span>

neural network pruning and taking into account input data correlations; it
makes it possible to update neuron states only when changes in them exceed a
certain threshold. It significantly reduces the number of multiplications when
running neural networks. We tested different RL tasks and achieved 20-150x
reduction in the number of multiplications. There were no substantial

                    <span>Session-based recommendation systems suggest relevant items to users by
modeling user behavior and preferences using short-term anonymous sessions.
Existing methods leverage Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) that propagate and
aggregate information from neighboring nodes i.e., local message passing. Such
graph-based architectures have representational limits, as a single sub-graph
is susceptible to overfit the sequential dependencies instead of accounting for
complex transitions between items in different sessions. We propose a new
technique that leverages a Transformer in combination with a target attentive
GNN. This allows richer representations to be learnt, which translates to
empirical performance gains in comparison to a vanilla target attentive GNN.
Our experimental results and ablation show that our proposed method is
competitive with the existing methods on real-world benchmark datasets,
improving on graph-based hypotheses. Code is available at

dependent term introduced by private optimization compounds the difficulties of
learning a robust model. After this, we discuss what parts of adversarial
training and differential privacy hurt optimization, identifying that the size
of adversarial perturbation and clipping norm in differential privacy both
increase the curvature of the loss landscape, implying poorer generalization

                    <span>Multimodal Language Analysis is a demanding area of research, since it is
associated with two requirements: combining different modalities and capturing
temporal information. During the last years, several works have been proposed
in the area, mostly centered around supervised learning in downstream tasks. In
this paper we propose extracting unsupervised Multimodal Language
representations that are universal and can be applied to different tasks.
Towards this end, we map the word-level aligned multimodal sequences to 2-D
matrices and then use Convolutional Autoencoders to learn embeddings by
combining multiple datasets. Extensive experimentation on Sentiment Analysis
(MOSEI) and Emotion Recognition (IEMOCAP) indicate that the learned
representations can achieve near-state-of-the-art performance with just the use
of a Logistic Regression algorithm for downstream classification. It is also
shown that our method is extremely lightweight and can be easily generalized to
other tasks and unseen data with small performance drop and almost the same
number of parameters. The proposed multimodal representation models are
open-sourced and will help grow the applicability of Multimodal Language.</span>

a new state-of-the-art paralinguistic representation derived from large-scale,
fully self-supervised training of a 600M+ parameter Conformer-based
architecture. We benchmark on a diverse set of speech tasks and demonstrate
that simple linear classifiers trained on top of our time-averaged
representation outperform nearly all previous results, in some cases by large
margins. Our analyses of context-window size demonstrate that, surprisingly, 2
second context-windows achieve 96\% the performance of the Conformers that use
the full long-term context on 7 out of 9 tasks. Furthermore, while the best
per-task representations are extracted internally in the network, stable
performance across several layers allows a single universal representation to
reach near optimal performance on all tasks.</span>

                    <span>General policy improvement (GPI) and trust-region learning (TRL) are the
predominant frameworks within contemporary reinforcement learning (RL), which
serve as the core models for solving Markov decision processes (MDPs).
Unfortunately, in their mathematical form, they are sensitive to modifications,
and thus, the practical instantiations that implement them do not automatically
inherit their improvement guarantees. As a result, the spectrum of available
rigorous MDP-solvers is narrow. Indeed, many state-of-the-art (SOTA)
algorithms, such as TRPO and PPO, are not proven to converge. In this paper, we
propose \textsl{mirror learning} -- a general solution to the RL problem. We
reveal GPI and TRL to be but small points within this far greater space of
algorithms which boasts the monotonic improvement property and converges to the
optimal policy. We show that virtually all SOTA algorithms for RL are instances
of mirror learning, and thus suggest that their empirical performance is a
consequence of their theoretical properties, rather than of approximate
analogies. Excitingly, we show that mirror learning opens up a whole new space
of policy learning methods with convergence guarantees.</span>

                    <span>In time series data analysis, detecting change points on a real-time basis
(online) is of great interest in many areas, such as finance, environmental
monitoring, and medicine. One promising means to achieve this is the Bayesian
online change point detection (BOCPD) algorithm, which has been successfully
adopted in particular cases in which the time series of interest has a fixed
baseline. However, we have found that the algorithm struggles when the baseline
irreversibly shifts from its initial state. This is because with the original
BOCPD algorithm, the sensitivity with which a change point can be detected is
degraded if the data points are fluctuating at locations relatively far from
the original baseline. In this paper, we not only extend the original BOCPD
algorithm to be applicable to a time series whose baseline is constantly
shifting toward unknown values but also visualize why the proposed extension
works. To demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed algorithm compared to the
original one, we examine these algorithms on two real-world data sets and six
synthetic data sets.</span>

a pair of input data. While mixup generally improves the prediction
performance, it sometimes degrades the performance. In this paper, we first
identify the main causes of this phenomenon by theoretically and empirically
analyzing the mixup algorithm. To resolve this, we propose GenLabel, a simple

helps the mixup algorithm correctly label mixup samples by learning the

                    <span>Intracranial aneurysms are common nowadays and how to detect them
intelligently is of great significance in digital health. While most existing
deep learning research focused on medical images in a supervised way, we
introduce an unsupervised method for the detection of intracranial aneurysms
based on 3D point cloud data. In particular, our method consists of two stages:
unsupervised pre-training and downstream tasks. As for the former, the main
idea is to pair each point cloud with its jittered counterpart and maximise
their correspondence. Then we design a dual-branch contrastive network with an
encoder for each branch and a subsequent common projection head. As for the
latter, we design simple networks for supervised classification and
segmentation training. Experiments on the public dataset (IntrA) show that our
unsupervised method achieves comparable or even better performance than some
state-of-the-art supervised techniques, and it is most prominent in the
detection of aneurysmal vessels. Experiments on the ModelNet40 also show that
our method achieves the accuracy of 90.79\% which outperforms existing
state-of-the-art unsupervised models.</span>

                    <span>Metric $k$-center clustering is a fundamental unsupervised learning
primitive. Although widely used, this primitive is heavily affected by noise in
the data, so that a more sensible variant seeks for the best solution that
disregards a given number $z$ of points of the dataset, called outliers. We
provide efficient algorithms for this important variant in the streaming model
under the sliding window setting, where, at each time step, the dataset to be
clustered is the window $W$ of the most recent data items. Our algorithms
achieve $O(1)$ approximation and, remarkably, require a working memory linear
in $k+z$ and only logarithmic in $|W|$. As a by-product, we show how to
estimate the effective diameter of the window $W$, which is a measure of the
spread of the window points, disregarding a given fraction of noisy distances.
We also provide experimental evidence of the practical viability of our
theoretical results.</span>

                    <span>Transformers have seen an unprecedented rise in Natural Language Processing
and Computer Vision tasks. However, in audio tasks, they are either infeasible
to train due to extremely large sequence length of audio waveforms or incur a
performance penalty when trained on Fourier-based features. In this work, we
introduce an architecture, Audiomer, where we combine 1D Residual Networks with
Performer Attention to achieve state-of-the-art performance in keyword spotting
with raw audio waveforms, outperforming all previous methods while being
computationally cheaper and parameter-efficient. Additionally, our model has
practical advantages for speech processing, such as inference on arbitrarily
long audio clips owing to the absence of positional encoding. The code is

                    <span>Crime prediction is crucial for public safety and resource optimization, yet
is very challenging due to two aspects: i) the dynamics of criminal patterns
across time and space, crime events are distributed unevenly on both spatial
and temporal domains; ii) time-evolving dependencies between different types of
crimes (e.g., Theft, Robbery, Assault, Damage) which reveal fine-grained
semantics of crimes. To tackle these challenges, we propose Spatial-Temporal
Sequential Hypergraph Network (ST-SHN) to collectively encode complex crime
spatial-temporal patterns as well as the underlying category-wise crime
semantic relationships. In specific, to handle spatial-temporal dynamics under
the long-range and global context, we design a graph-structured message passing
architecture with the integration of the hypergraph learning paradigm. To
capture category-wise crime heterogeneous relations in a dynamic environment,
we introduce a multi-channel routing mechanism to learn the time-evolving
structural dependency across crime types. We conduct extensive experiments on
two real-world datasets, showing that our proposed ST-SHN framework can
significantly improve the prediction performance as compared to various
state-of-the-art baselines. The source code is available at:

                    <span>Modern self-driving perception systems have been shown to improve upon
processing complementary inputs such as LiDAR with images. In isolation, 2D
images have been found to be extremely vulnerable to adversarial attacks. Yet,
there have been limited studies on the adversarial robustness of multi-modal
models that fuse LiDAR features with image features. Furthermore, existing
works do not consider physically realizable perturbations that are consistent
across the input modalities. In this paper, we showcase practical
susceptibilities of multi-sensor detection by placing an adversarial object on
top of a host vehicle. We focus on physically realizable and input-agnostic
attacks as they are feasible to execute in practice, and show that a single
universal adversary can hide different host vehicles from state-of-the-art
multi-modal detectors. Our experiments demonstrate that successful attacks are
primarily caused by easily corrupted image features. Furthermore, we find that
in modern sensor fusion methods which project image features into 3D,
adversarial attacks can exploit the projection process to generate false
positives across distant regions in 3D. Towards more robust multi-modal
perception systems, we show that adversarial training with feature denoising
can boost robustness to such attacks significantly. However, we find that
standard adversarial defenses still struggle to prevent false positives which
are also caused by inaccurate associations between 3D LiDAR points and 2D
pixels.</span>

                    <span>Protein-protein interactions (PPIs) are critical to normal cellular function
and are related to many disease pathways. However, only 4% of PPIs are
annotated with PTMs in biological knowledge databases such as IntAct, mainly
performed through manual curation, which is neither time nor cost-effective. We
use the IntAct PPI database to create a distant supervised dataset annotated
with interacting protein pairs, their corresponding PTM type, and associated
abstracts from the PubMed database. We train an ensemble of BioBERT models -
dubbed PPI-BioBERT-x10 to improve confidence calibration. We extend the use of
ensemble average confidence approach with confidence variation to counteract
the effects of class imbalance to extract high confidence predictions. The
PPI-BioBERT-x10 model evaluated on the test set resulted in a modest F1-micro
41.3 (P &#x3D;5 8.1, R &#x3D; 32.1). However, by combining high confidence and low
variation to identify high quality predictions, tuning the predictions for
precision, we retained 19% of the test predictions with 100% precision. We
evaluated PPI-BioBERT-x10 on 18 million PubMed abstracts and extracted 1.6
million (546507 unique PTM-PPI triplets) PTM-PPI predictions, and filter ~ 5700
(4584 unique) high confidence predictions. Of the 5700, human evaluation on a
small randomly sampled subset shows that the precision drops to 33.7% despite
confidence calibration and highlights the challenges of generalisability beyond
the test set even with confidence calibration. We circumvent the problem by
only including predictions associated with multiple papers, improving the
precision to 58.8%. In this work, we highlight the benefits and challenges of
deep learning-based text mining in practice, and the need for increased
emphasis on confidence calibration to facilitate human curation efforts.</span>

                    <span>Recent work learns contextual representations of source code by
reconstructing tokens from their context. For downstream semantic understanding
tasks like summarizing code in English, these representations should ideally
capture program functionality. However, we show that the popular
reconstruction-based BERT model is sensitive to source code edits, even when
the edits preserve semantics. We propose ContraCode: a contrastive pre-training
task that learns code functionality, not form. ContraCode pre-trains a neural
network to identify functionally similar variants of a program among many
non-equivalent distractors. We scalably generate these variants using an
automated source-to-source compiler as a form of data augmentation. Contrastive
pre-training improves JavaScript summarization and TypeScript type inference
accuracy by 2% to 13%. We also propose a new zero-shot JavaScript code clone
detection dataset, showing that ContraCode is both more robust and semantically
meaningful. On it, we outperform RoBERTa by 39% AUROC in an adversarial setting
and up to 5% on natural code.</span>

                    <span>This paper focuses on stochastic saddle point problems with
decision-dependent distributions in both the static and time-varying settings.
These are problems whose objective is the expected value of a stochastic payoff
function, where random variables are drawn from a distribution induced by a
distributional map. For general distributional maps, the problem of finding
saddle points is in general computationally burdensome, even if the
distribution is known. To enable a tractable solution approach, we introduce
the notion of equilibrium points -- which are saddle points for the stationary
stochastic minimax problem that they induce -- and provide conditions for their
existence and uniqueness. We demonstrate that the distance between the two
classes of solutions is bounded provided that the objective has a
strongly-convex-strongly-concave payoff and Lipschitz continuous distributional
map. We develop deterministic and stochastic primal-dual algorithms and
demonstrate their convergence to the equilibrium point. In particular, by
modeling errors emerging from a stochastic gradient estimator as sub-Weibull
random variables, we provide error bounds in expectation and in high
probability that hold for each iteration; moreover, we show convergence to a
neighborhood in expectation and almost surely. Finally, we investigate a
condition on the distributional map -- which we call opposing mixture dominance
-- that ensures the objective is strongly-convex-strongly-concave. Under this
assumption, we show that primal-dual algorithms converge to the saddle points
in a similar fashion.</span>

                    <span>We are concerned with the problem of hyperparameter selection of offline
policy evaluation (OPE). OPE is a key component of offline reinforcement
learning, which is a core technology for data-driven decision optimization
without environment simulators. However, the current state-of-the-art OPE
methods are not hyperparameter-free, which undermines their utility in
real-life applications. We address this issue by introducing a new approximate
hyperparameter selection (AHS) framework for OPE, which defines a notion of
optimality (called selection criteria) in a quantitative and interpretable
manner without hyperparameters. We then derive four AHS methods each of which
has different characteristics such as convergence rate and time complexity.
Finally, we verify effectiveness and limitation of these methods with a
preliminary experiment.</span>

                    <span>Neural operators have recently become popular tools for designing solution
maps between function spaces in the form of neural networks. Differently from
classical scientific machine learning approaches that learn parameters of a
known partial differential equation (PDE) for a single instance of the input
parameters at a fixed resolution, neural operators approximate the solution map
of a family of PDEs. Despite their success, the uses of neural operators are so
far restricted to relatively shallow neural networks and confined to learning
hidden governing laws. In this work, we propose a novel nonlocal neural
operator, which we refer to as nonlocal kernel network (NKN), that is
resolution independent, characterized by deep neural networks, and capable of
handling a variety of tasks such as learning governing equations and
classifying images. Our NKN stems from the interpretation of the neural network
as a discrete nonlocal diffusion reaction equation that, in the limit of
infinite layers, is equivalent to a parabolic nonlocal equation, whose
stability is analyzed via nonlocal vector calculus. The resemblance with
integral forms of neural operators allows NKNs to capture long-range
dependencies in the feature space, while the continuous treatment of
node-to-node interactions makes NKNs resolution independent. The resemblance
with neural ODEs, reinterpreted in a nonlocal sense, and the stable network
dynamics between layers allow for generalization of NKN&#x27;s optimal parameters
from shallow to deep networks. This fact enables the use of shallow-to-deep
initialization techniques. Our tests show that NKNs outperform baseline methods
in both learning governing equations and image classification tasks and
generalize well to different resolutions and depths.</span>

                    <span>COVID-19 pandemic, is still unknown and is an important open question. There
are speculations that bats are a possible origin. Likewise, there are many
closely related (corona-) viruses, such as SARS, which was found to be
transmitted through civets. The study of the different hosts which can be
potential carriers and transmitters of deadly viruses to humans is crucial to
understanding, mitigating and preventing current and future pandemics. In
coronaviruses, the surface (S) protein, or spike protein, is an important part
of determining host specificity since it is the point of contact between the
virus and the host cell membrane. In this paper, we classify the hosts of over
five thousand coronaviruses from their spike protein sequences, segregating
them into clusters of distinct hosts among avians, bats, camels, swines, humans
and weasels, to name a few. We propose a feature embedding based on the
well-known position-weight matrix (PWM), which we call PWM2Vec, and use to
generate feature vectors from the spike protein sequences of these
coronaviruses. While our embedding is inspired by the success of PWMs in
biological applications such as determining protein function, or identifying
transcription factor binding sites, we are the first (to the best of our
knowledge) to use PWMs in the context of host classification from viral
sequences to generate a fixed-length feature vector representation. The results
on the real world data show that in using PWM2Vec, we are able to perform
comparably well as compared to baseline models. We also measure the importance
of different amino acids using information gain to show the amino acids which
are important for predicting the host of a given coronavirus.</span>

matching networks for the disparity estimation task. We present a method to
craft a single set of perturbations that, when added to any stereo image pair
in a dataset, can fool a stereo network to significantly alter the perceived
scene geometry. Our perturbation images are &quot;universal&quot; in that they not only
corrupt estimates of the network on the dataset they are optimized for, but
also generalize to stereo networks with different architectures across
different datasets. We evaluate our approach on multiple public benchmark
datasets and show that our perturbations can increase D1-error (akin to fooling
rate) of state-of-the-art stereo networks from 1% to as much as 87%. We
investigate the effect of perturbations on the estimated scene geometry and
identify object classes that are most vulnerable. Our analysis on the
activations of registered points between left and right images led us to find
that certain architectural components, i.e. deformable convolution and explicit
matching, can increase robustness against adversaries. We demonstrate that by
simply designing networks with such components, one can reduce the effect of
adversaries by up to 60.5%, which rivals the robustness of networks fine-tuned
with costly adversarial data augmentation.</span>

                    <span>This paper presents FogAdapt, a novel approach for domain adaptation of
semantic segmentation for dense foggy scenes. Although significant research has
been directed to reduce the domain shift in semantic segmentation, adaptation
to scenes with adverse weather conditions remains an open question. Large
variations in the visibility of the scene due to weather conditions, such as
fog, smog, and haze, exacerbate the domain shift, thus making unsupervised
adaptation in such scenarios challenging. We propose a self-entropy and
multi-scale information augmented self-supervised domain adaptation method
(FogAdapt) to minimize the domain shift in foggy scenes segmentation. Supported
by the empirical evidence that an increase in fog density results in high
self-entropy for segmentation probabilities, we introduce a self-entropy based
loss function to guide the adaptation method. Furthermore, inferences obtained
at different image scales are combined and weighted by the uncertainty to
generate scale-invariant pseudo-labels for the target domain. These
scale-invariant pseudo-labels are robust to visibility and scale variations. We
evaluate the proposed model on real clear-weather scenes to real foggy scenes
adaptation and synthetic non-foggy images to real foggy scenes adaptation
scenarios. Our experiments demonstrate that FogAdapt significantly outperforms
the current state-of-the-art in semantic segmentation of foggy images.
Specifically, by considering the standard settings compared to state-of-the-art
(SOTA) methods, FogAdapt gains 3.8% on Foggy Zurich, 6.0% on Foggy
Driving-dense, and 3.6% on Foggy Driving in mIoU when adapted from Cityscapes
to Foggy Zurich.</span>

                    <span>The rise of deep learning algorithms has led many researchers to withdraw
from using classic signal processing methods for sound generation. Deep
learning models have achieved expressive voice synthesis, realistic sound
textures, and musical notes from virtual instruments. However, the most
suitable deep learning architecture is still under investigation. The choice of
architecture is tightly coupled to the audio representations. A sound&#x27;s
original waveform can be too dense and rich for deep learning models to deal
with efficiently - and complexity increases training time and computational
cost. Also, it does not represent sound in the manner in which it is perceived.
Therefore, in many cases, the raw audio has been transformed into a compressed
and more meaningful form using upsampling, feature-extraction, or even by
adopting a higher level illustration of the waveform. Furthermore, conditional
on the form chosen, additional conditioning representations, different model
architectures, and numerous metrics for evaluating the reconstructed sound have
been investigated. This paper provides an overview of audio representations
applied to sound synthesis using deep learning. Additionally, it presents the
most significant methods for developing and evaluating a sound synthesis
architecture using deep learning models, always depending on the audio
representation.</span>

                    <span>Multi-task learning is to improve the performance of the model by
transferring and exploiting common knowledge among tasks. Existing MTL works
mainly focus on the scenario where label sets among multiple tasks (MTs) are
usually the same, thus they can be utilized for learning across the tasks.
While almost rare works explore the scenario where each task only has a small
amount of training samples, and their label sets are just partially overlapped
or even not. Learning such MTs is more challenging because of less correlation
information available among these tasks. For this, we propose a framework to
learn these tasks by jointly leveraging both abundant information from a learnt
auxiliary big task with sufficiently many classes to cover those of all these
tasks and the information shared among those partially-overlapped tasks. In our
implementation of using the same neural network architecture of the learnt
auxiliary task to learn individual tasks, the key idea is to utilize available
label information to adaptively prune the hidden layer neurons of the auxiliary
network to construct corresponding network for each task, while accompanying a
joint learning across individual tasks. Our experimental results demonstrate
its effectiveness in comparison with the state-of-the-art approaches.</span>

                    <span>We design a machine learning technique to solve the general problem of
inferring physical parameters from the observation of turbulent flows, a
relevant exercise in many theoretical and applied fields, from engineering to
earth observation and astrophysics. Our approach is to train the machine
learning system to regress the rotation frequency of the flow&#x27;s reference
frame, from the observation of the flow&#x27;s velocity amplitude on a 2d plane
extracted from the 3d domain. The machine learning approach consists of a Deep
Convolutional Neural Network (DCNN) of the same kind developed in computer
vision. The training and validation datasets are produced by means of fully
resolved direct numerical simulations. This study shows interesting results
from two different points of view. From the machine learning point of view it
shows the potential of DCNN, reaching good results on such a particularly
complex problem that goes well outside the limits of human vision. Second, from
the physics point of view, it provides an example on how machine learning can
be exploited in data analysis to infer information that would be inaccessible
otherwise. Indeed, by comparing DCNN with the other possible Bayesian
approaches, we find that DCNN yields to a much higher inference accuracy in all
the examined cases.</span>

                    <span>In this paper, we consider a highly general image recognition setting
wherein, given a labelled and unlabelled set of images, the task is to
categorize all images in the unlabelled set. Here, the unlabelled images may
come from labelled classes or from novel ones. Existing recognition methods are
not able to deal with this setting, because they make several restrictive
assumptions, such as the unlabelled instances only coming from known - or
unknown - classes and the number of unknown classes being known a-priori. We
address the more unconstrained setting, naming it &#x27;Generalized Category
Discovery&#x27;, and challenge all these assumptions. We first establish strong
baselines by taking state-of-the-art algorithms from novel category discovery
and adapting them for this task. Next, we propose the use of vision
transformers with contrastive representation learning for this open world
setting. We then introduce a simple yet effective semi-supervised $k$-means
method to cluster the unlabelled data into seen and unseen classes
automatically, substantially outperforming the baselines. Finally, we also
propose a new approach to estimate the number of classes in the unlabelled
data. We thoroughly evaluate our approach on public datasets for generic object
classification including CIFAR10, CIFAR100 and ImageNet-100, and for
fine-grained visual recognition including CUB, Stanford Cars and Herbarium19,
benchmarking on this new setting to foster future research.</span>

                    <span>Classification models are a fundamental component of physical-asset
management technologies such as structural health monitoring (SHM) systems and
digital twins. Previous work introduced \textit{risk-based active learning}, an
online approach for the development of statistical classifiers that takes into
account the decision-support context in which they are applied. Decision-making
is considered by preferentially querying data labels according to
\textit{expected value of perfect information} (EVPI). Although several
benefits are gained by adopting a risk-based active learning approach,
including improved decision-making performance, the algorithms suffer from
issues relating to sampling bias as a result of the guided querying process.
This sampling bias ultimately manifests as a decline in decision-making
performance during the later stages of active learning, which in turn
corresponds to lost resource/utility.

The current paper proposes two novel approaches to counteract the effects of
sampling bias: \textit{semi-supervised learning}, and \textit{discriminative
classification models}. These approaches are first visualised using a synthetic
dataset, then subsequently applied to an experimental case study, specifically,
the Z24 Bridge dataset. The semi-supervised learning approach is shown to have
variable performance; with robustness to sampling bias dependent on the
suitability of the generative distributions selected for the model with respect
to each dataset. In contrast, the discriminative classifiers are shown to have
excellent robustness to the effects of sampling bias. Moreover, it was found
that the number of inspections made during a monitoring campaign, and therefore
resource expenditure, could be reduced with the careful selection of the
statistical classifiers used within a decision-supporting monitoring system.</span>

                    <span>The similarity of feature representations plays a pivotal role in the success
of problems related to domain adaptation. Feature similarity includes both the
invariance of marginal distributions and the closeness of conditional
distributions given the desired response $y$ (e.g., class labels).
Unfortunately, traditional methods always learn such features without fully
taking into consideration the information in $y$, which in turn may lead to a
mismatch of the conditional distributions or the mix-up of discriminative
structures underlying data distributions. In this work, we introduce the
recently proposed von Neumann conditional divergence to improve the
transferability across multiple domains. We show that this new divergence is
differentiable and eligible to easily quantify the functional dependence
between features and $y$. Given multiple source tasks, we integrate this
divergence to capture discriminative information in $y$ and design novel
learning objectives assuming those source tasks are observed either
simultaneously or sequentially. In both scenarios, we obtain favorable
performance against state-of-the-art methods in terms of smaller generalization
error on new tasks and less catastrophic forgetting on source tasks (in the
sequential setup).</span>

                    <span>Understanding capabilities and limitations of different network architectures
is of fundamental importance to machine learning. Bayesian inference on
Gaussian processes has proven to be a viable approach for studying recurrent
and deep networks in the limit of infinite layer width, $n\to\infty$. Here we
present a unified and systematic derivation of the mean-field theory for both
architectures that starts from first principles by employing established
methods from statistical physics of disordered systems. The theory elucidates
that while the mean-field equations are different with regard to their temporal
structure, they yet yield identical Gaussian kernels when readouts are taken at
a single time point or layer, respectively. Bayesian inference applied to
classification then predicts identical performance and capabilities for the two
architectures. Numerically, we find that convergence towards the mean-field
theory is typically slower for recurrent networks than for deep networks and
the convergence speed depends non-trivially on the parameters of the weight
prior as well as the depth or number of time steps, respectively. Our method
exposes that Gaussian processes are but the lowest order of a systematic
expansion in $1/n$. The formalism thus paves the way to investigate the
fundamental differences between recurrent and deep architectures at finite
widths $n$.</span>

Using techniques from mixed-integer optimization, polyhedral theory, and
tropical geometry, we provide a mathematical counterbalance to the universal
approximation theorems which suggest that a single hidden layer is sufficient
for learning tasks. In particular, we investigate whether the class of exactly
representable functions strictly increases by adding more layers (with no
restrictions on size). This problem has potential impact on algorithmic and
statistical aspects because of the insight it provides into the class of
functions represented by neural hypothesis classes. However, to the best of our
knowledge, this question has not been investigated in the neural network
literature. We also present upper bounds on the sizes of neural networks

real and fake trajectories of stock prices, which are indistinguishable by
visual inspection. We also show a real life application by using transaction

means of our unsupervised learning algorithm, thus achieving results that are
close to the state-of-the-art in the field based on supervised learning.</span>

                    <span>We are concerned with the problem of hyperparameter selection of offline
policy evaluation (OPE). OPE is a key component of offline reinforcement
learning, which is a core technology for data-driven decision optimization
without environment simulators. However, the current state-of-the-art OPE
methods are not hyperparameter-free, which undermines their utility in
real-life applications. We address this issue by introducing a new approximate
hyperparameter selection (AHS) framework for OPE, which defines a notion of
optimality (called selection criteria) in a quantitative and interpretable
manner without hyperparameters. We then derive four AHS methods each of which
has different characteristics such as convergence rate and time complexity.
Finally, we verify effectiveness and limitation of these methods with a

                    <span>Clustering is a fundamental primitive in unsupervised learning which gives
rise to a rich class of computationally-challenging inference tasks. In this
work, we focus on the canonical task of clustering d-dimensional Gaussian
mixtures with unknown (and possibly degenerate) covariance. Recent works (Ghosh
et al. &#x27;20; Mao, Wein &#x27;21; Davis, Diaz, Wang &#x27;21) have established lower bounds
against the class of low-degree polynomial methods and the sum-of-squares (SoS)
hierarchy for recovering certain hidden structures planted in Gaussian
clustering instances. Prior work on many similar inference tasks portends that
such lower bounds strongly suggest the presence of an inherent
statistical-to-computational gap for clustering, that is, a parameter regime
where the clustering task is statistically possible but no polynomial-time
algorithm succeeds.

One special case of the clustering task we consider is equivalent to the
problem of finding a planted hypercube vector in an otherwise random subspace.
We show that, perhaps surprisingly, this particular clustering model does not
exhibit a statistical-to-computational gap, even though the aforementioned
low-degree and SoS lower bounds continue to apply in this case. To achieve
this, we give a polynomial-time algorithm based on the Lenstra--Lenstra--Lovasz
lattice basis reduction method which achieves the statistically-optimal sample
complexity of d+1 samples. This result extends the class of problems whose
conjectured statistical-to-computational gaps can be &quot;closed&quot; by &quot;brittle&quot;
polynomial-time algorithms, highlighting the crucial but subtle role of noise
in the onset of statistical-to-computational gaps.</span>

                    <span>An important problem in causal inference is to break down the total effect of
a treatment on an outcome into different causal pathways and to quantify the
causal effect in each pathway. For instance, in causal fairness, the total
effect of being a male employee (i.e., treatment) constitutes its direct effect
on annual income (i.e., outcome) and the indirect effect via the employee&#x27;s
occupation (i.e., mediator). Causal mediation analysis (CMA) is a formal
statistical framework commonly used to reveal such underlying causal
mechanisms. One major challenge of CMA in observational studies is handling
confounders, variables that cause spurious causal relationships among
treatment, mediator, and outcome. Conventional methods assume sequential
ignorability that implies all confounders can be measured, which is often
unverifiable in practice. This work aims to circumvent the stringent sequential
ignorability assumptions and consider hidden confounders. Drawing upon proxy
strategies and recent advances in deep learning, we propose to simultaneously
uncover the latent variables that characterize hidden confounders and estimate
the causal effects. Empirical evaluations using both synthetic and
semi-synthetic datasets validate the effectiveness of the proposed method. We
further show the potentials of our approach for causal fairness analysis.</span>

                    <span>Neural operators have recently become popular tools for designing solution
maps between function spaces in the form of neural networks. Differently from
classical scientific machine learning approaches that learn parameters of a
known partial differential equation (PDE) for a single instance of the input
parameters at a fixed resolution, neural operators approximate the solution map
of a family of PDEs. Despite their success, the uses of neural operators are so
far restricted to relatively shallow neural networks and confined to learning
hidden governing laws. In this work, we propose a novel nonlocal neural
operator, which we refer to as nonlocal kernel network (NKN), that is
resolution independent, characterized by deep neural networks, and capable of
handling a variety of tasks such as learning governing equations and
classifying images. Our NKN stems from the interpretation of the neural network
as a discrete nonlocal diffusion reaction equation that, in the limit of
infinite layers, is equivalent to a parabolic nonlocal equation, whose
stability is analyzed via nonlocal vector calculus. The resemblance with
integral forms of neural operators allows NKNs to capture long-range
dependencies in the feature space, while the continuous treatment of
node-to-node interactions makes NKNs resolution independent. The resemblance
with neural ODEs, reinterpreted in a nonlocal sense, and the stable network
dynamics between layers allow for generalization of NKN&#x27;s optimal parameters
from shallow to deep networks. This fact enables the use of shallow-to-deep
initialization techniques. Our tests show that NKNs outperform baseline methods
in both learning governing equations and image classification tasks and
generalize well to different resolutions and depths.</span>

                    <span>We develop the &quot;generalized consistent weighted sampling&quot; (GCWS) for hashing
the &quot;powered-GMM&quot; (pGMM) kernel (with a tuning parameter $p$). It turns out
that GCWS provides a numerically stable scheme for applying power
transformation on the original data, regardless of the magnitude of $p$ and the
data. The power transformation is often effective for boosting the performance,
in many cases considerably so. We feed the hashed data to neural networks on a
variety of public classification datasets and name our method &#x60;&#x60;GCWSNet&#x27;&#x27;. Our
extensive experiments show that GCWSNet often improves the classification
accuracy. Furthermore, it is evident from the experiments that GCWSNet
converges substantially faster. In fact, GCWS often reaches a reasonable
accuracy with merely (less than) one epoch of the training process. This
property is much desired because many applications, such as advertisement
click-through rate (CTR) prediction models, or data streams (i.e., data seen
only once), often train just one epoch. Another beneficial side effect is that
the computations of the first layer of the neural networks become additions
instead of multiplications because the input data become binary (and highly
sparse).

Empirical comparisons with (normalized) random Fourier features (NRFF) are
provided. We also propose to reduce the model size of GCWSNet by count-sketch
and develop the theory for analyzing the impact of using count-sketch on the
accuracy of GCWS. Our analysis shows that an &#x60;&#x60;8-bit&#x27;&#x27; strategy should work
well in that we can always apply an 8-bit count-sketch hashing on the output of
GCWS hashing without hurting the accuracy much. There are many other ways to
take advantage of GCWS when training deep neural networks. For example, one can
apply GCWS on the outputs of the last layer to boost the accuracy of trained
deep neural networks.</span>

                    <span>Classification models are a fundamental component of physical-asset
management technologies such as structural health monitoring (SHM) systems and
digital twins. Previous work introduced \textit{risk-based active learning}, an
online approach for the development of statistical classifiers that takes into
account the decision-support context in which they are applied. Decision-making
is considered by preferentially querying data labels according to
\textit{expected value of perfect information} (EVPI). Although several
benefits are gained by adopting a risk-based active learning approach,
including improved decision-making performance, the algorithms suffer from
issues relating to sampling bias as a result of the guided querying process.
This sampling bias ultimately manifests as a decline in decision-making
performance during the later stages of active learning, which in turn
corresponds to lost resource/utility.

The current paper proposes two novel approaches to counteract the effects of
sampling bias: \textit{semi-supervised learning}, and \textit{discriminative
classification models}. These approaches are first visualised using a synthetic
dataset, then subsequently applied to an experimental case study, specifically,
the Z24 Bridge dataset. The semi-supervised learning approach is shown to have
variable performance; with robustness to sampling bias dependent on the
suitability of the generative distributions selected for the model with respect
to each dataset. In contrast, the discriminative classifiers are shown to have
excellent robustness to the effects of sampling bias. Moreover, it was found
that the number of inspections made during a monitoring campaign, and therefore
resource expenditure, could be reduced with the careful selection of the
statistical classifiers used within a decision-supporting monitoring system.</span>

                    <span>Rankings and scores are two common data types used by judges to express
preferences and/or perceptions of quality in a collection of objects. Numerous
models exist to study data of each type separately, but no unified statistical
model captures both data types simultaneously without first performing data
conversion. We propose the Mallows-Binomial model to close this gap, which
combines a Mallows&#x27; $\phi$ ranking model with Binomial score models through
shared parameters that quantify object quality, a consensus ranking, and the
level of consensus between judges. We propose an efficient tree-search
algorithm to calculate the exact MLE of model parameters, study statistical
properties of the model both analytically and through simulation, and apply our
model to real data from an instance of grant panel review that collected both
scores and partial rankings. Furthermore, we demonstrate how model outputs can
be used to rank objects with confidence. The proposed model is shown to
sensibly combine information from both scores and rankings to quantify object
quality and measure consensus with appropriate levels of statistical
uncertainty.</span>

specifically, we show that our algorithms are significantly faster than Gibbs

                    <span>Numerical models based on physics represent the state-of-the-art in earth
system modeling and comprise our best tools for generating insights and
predictions. Despite rapid growth in computational power, the perceived need
for higher model resolutions overwhelms the latest-generation computers,
reducing the ability of modelers to generate simulations for understanding
parameter sensitivities and characterizing variability and uncertainty. Thus,
surrogate models are often developed to capture the essential attributes of the
full-blown numerical models. Recent successes of machine learning methods,
especially deep learning, across many disciplines offer the possibility that
complex nonlinear connectionist representations may be able to capture the
underlying complex structures and nonlinear processes in earth systems. A
difficult test for deep learning-based emulation, which refers to function
approximation of numerical models, is to understand whether they can be
comparable to traditional forms of surrogate models in terms of computational
efficiency while simultaneously reproducing model results in a credible manner.
A deep learning emulation that passes this test may be expected to perform even
better than simple models with respect to capturing complex processes and
spatiotemporal dependencies. Here we examine, with a case study in
satellite-based remote sensing, the hypothesis that deep learning approaches
can credibly represent the simulations from a surrogate model with comparable
computational efficiency. Our results are encouraging in that the deep learning
emulation reproduces the results with acceptable accuracy and often even faster
performance. We discuss the broader implications of our results in light of the
pace of improvements in high-performance implementations of deep learning as
well as the growing desire for higher-resolution simulations in the earth
sciences.</span>

                    <span>Deep autoencoders are often extended with a supervised or adversarial loss to
learn latent representations with desirable properties, such as greater
predictivity of labels and outcomes or fairness with respects to a sensitive
variable. Despite the ubiquity of supervised and adversarial deep latent factor
models, these methods should demonstrate improvement over simpler linear
approaches to be preferred in practice. This necessitates a reproducible linear
analog that still adheres to an augmenting supervised or adversarial objective.
We address this methodological gap by presenting methods that augment the
principal component analysis (PCA) objective with either a supervised or an
adversarial objective and provide analytic and reproducible solutions. We
implement these methods in an open-source Python package, AugmentedPCA, that
can produce excellent real-world baselines. We demonstrate the utility of these
factor models on an open-source, RNA-seq cancer gene expression dataset,
showing that augmenting with a supervised objective results in improved
downstream classification performance, produces principal components with
greater class fidelity, and facilitates identification of genes aligned with
the principal axes of data variance with implications to development of
specific types of cancer.</span>

from the perspective of statistical learning theory, modelled, in a simplified

identity activation function. In the purely stochastic (robust) regime, we give
a generalisation error bound that holds with high probability, thus showing
that the empirical risk minimiser is the best-in-class hypothesis. We show that
RNNs retain a partial signature of the paths they are fed as the unique
information exploited for training and classification tasks. We argue that
these RNNs are easy to train and robust and back these observations with
numerical experiments on both synthetic and real data. We also exhibit a
trade-off phenomenon between accuracy and robustness.</span>

                    <span>Recent work learns contextual representations of source code by
reconstructing tokens from their context. For downstream semantic understanding
tasks like summarizing code in English, these representations should ideally
capture program functionality. However, we show that the popular
reconstruction-based BERT model is sensitive to source code edits, even when
the edits preserve semantics. We propose ContraCode: a contrastive pre-training
task that learns code functionality, not form. ContraCode pre-trains a neural
network to identify functionally similar variants of a program among many
non-equivalent distractors. We scalably generate these variants using an
automated source-to-source compiler as a form of data augmentation. Contrastive
pre-training improves JavaScript summarization and TypeScript type inference
accuracy by 2% to 13%. We also propose a new zero-shot JavaScript code clone
detection dataset, showing that ContraCode is both more robust and semantically
meaningful. On it, we outperform RoBERTa by 39% AUROC in an adversarial setting

                    <span>Recent advances in AIoT technologies have led to an increasing popularity of
utilizing machine learning algorithms to detect operational failures for
cyber-physical systems (CPS). In its basic form, an anomaly detection module
monitors the sensor measurements and actuator states from the physical plant,
and detects anomalies in these measurements to identify abnormal operation
status. Nevertheless, building effective anomaly detection models for CPS is
rather challenging as the model has to accurately detect anomalies in presence
of highly complicated system dynamics and unknown amount of sensor noise. In
this work, we propose a novel time series anomaly detection method called
Neural System Identification and Bayesian Filtering (NSIBF) in which a
specially crafted neural network architecture is posed for system
identification, i.e., capturing the dynamics of CPS in a dynamical state-space
model; then a Bayesian filtering algorithm is naturally applied on top of the
&quot;identified&quot; state-space model for robust anomaly detection by tracking the
uncertainty of the hidden state of the system recursively over time. We provide
qualitative as well as quantitative experiments with the proposed method on a
synthetic and three real-world CPS datasets, showing that NSIBF compares
favorably to the state-of-the-art methods with considerable improvements on
anomaly detection in CPS.</span>

                    <span>This paper proposes a novel acoustic word embedding called Acoustic Neighbor
Embeddings where speech or text of arbitrary length are mapped to a vector
space of fixed, reduced dimensions by adapting stochastic neighbor embedding
(SNE) to sequential inputs. The Euclidean distance between coordinates in the
embedding space reflects the phonetic confusability between their corresponding
sequences. Two encoder neural networks are trained: an acoustic encoder that
accepts speech signals in the form of frame-wise subword posterior
probabilities obtained from an acoustic model and a text encoder that accepts
text in the form of subword transcriptions. Compared to a triplet loss
criterion, the proposed method is shown to have more effective gradients for
neural network training. Experimentally, it also gives more accurate results
with low-dimensional embeddings when the two encoder networks are used in
tandem in a word (name) recognition task, and when the text encoder network is
used standalone in an approximate phonetic matching task. In particular, in an
isolated name recognition task depending solely on Euclidean nearest-neighbor
search between the proposed embedding vectors, the recognition accuracy is
identical to that of conventional finite state transducer(FST)-based decoding
using test data with up to 1 million names in the vocabulary and 40 dimensions
in the embeddings.</span>

                    <span>The similarity between objects is significant in a broad range of areas.
While similarity can be measured using off-the-shelf distance functions, they
may fail to capture the inherent meaning of similarity, which tends to depend
on the underlying data and task. Moreover, conventional distance functions
limit the space of similarity measures to be symmetric and do not directly
allow comparing objects from different spaces. We propose using quantum
networks (GQSim) for learning task-dependent (a)symmetric similarity between
data that need not have the same dimensionality. We analyze the properties of
such similarity function analytically (for a simple case) and numerically (for
a complex case) and showthat these similarity measures can extract salient
features of the data. We also demonstrate that the similarity measure derived
using this technique is $(\epsilon,\gamma,\tau)$-good, resulting in
theoretically guaranteed performance. Finally, we conclude by applying this
technique for three relevant applications - Classification, Graph Completion,
Generative modeling.</span>

                    <span>In time series data analysis, detecting change points on a real-time basis
(online) is of great interest in many areas, such as finance, environmental
monitoring, and medicine. One promising means to achieve this is the Bayesian
online change point detection (BOCPD) algorithm, which has been successfully
adopted in particular cases in which the time series of interest has a fixed
baseline. However, we have found that the algorithm struggles when the baseline
irreversibly shifts from its initial state. This is because with the original
BOCPD algorithm, the sensitivity with which a change point can be detected is
degraded if the data points are fluctuating at locations relatively far from
the original baseline. In this paper, we not only extend the original BOCPD
algorithm to be applicable to a time series whose baseline is constantly
shifting toward unknown values but also visualize why the proposed extension
works. To demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed algorithm compared to the
original one, we examine these algorithms on two real-world data sets and six
synthetic data sets.</span>

approach, machine learning or statistical modeling, to solve an analytics
challenge. However, machine learning and statistical modeling are more cousins
than adversaries on different sides of an analysis battleground. Choosing
between the two approaches or in some cases using both is based on the problem
to be solved and outcomes required as well as the data available for use and
circumstances of the analysis. Machine learning and statistical modeling are
complementary, based on similar mathematical principles, but simply using
different tools in an overall analytics knowledge base. Determining the
predominant approach should be based on the problem to be solved as well as
empirical evidence, such as size and completeness of the data, number of
variables, assumptions or lack thereof, and expected outcomes such as
predictions or causality. Good analysts and data scientists should be well
versed in both techniques and their proper application, thereby using the right
tool for the right project to achieve the desired results.</span>

                    <span>One of the fundamental assumptions in stochastic control of continuous time
processes is that the dynamics of the underlying (diffusion) process is known.
This is, however, usually obviously not fulfilled in practice. On the other
hand, over the last decades, a rich theory for nonparametric estimation of the
drift (and volatility) for continuous time processes has been developed. The
aim of this paper is bringing together techniques from stochastic control with
methods from statistics for stochastic processes to find a way to both learn
the dynamics of the underlying process and control in a reasonable way at the
same time. More precisely, we study a long-term average impulse control
problem, a stochastic version of the classical Faustmann timber harvesting
problem. One of the problems that immediately arises is an
exploration-exploitation dilemma as is well known for problems in machine
learning. We propose a way to deal with this issue by combining exploration and
exploitation periods in a suitable way. Our main finding is that this
construction can be based on the rates of convergence of estimators for the
invariant density. Using this, we obtain that the average cumulated regret is
of uniform order $O({T^{-1/3}})$.</span>

                    <span>In this work, we analyze the noisy importance sampling (IS), i.e., IS working
with noisy evaluations of the target density. We present the general framework
and derive optimal proposal densities for noisy IS estimators. The optimal
proposals incorporate the information of the variance of the noisy
realizations, proposing points in regions where the noise power is higher. We
also compare the use of the optimal proposals with previous optimality
approaches considered in a noisy IS framework.</span>

                    <span>Posted by Jeff Dean, Senior Fellow and SVP of Google Research, on behalf of the entire Google Research community
Over the last several decades, I&#x27;ve witnessed a lot of change in the fields of machine learning (ML) and computer science. Early approaches, which often fell short, eventually gave rise to modern approaches that have been very successful. Following that long-arc pattern of progress, I think we&#x27;ll see a number of exciting advances over the next several years, advances that will ultimately benefit the lives of billions of people with greater impact than ever before. In this post, I’ll highlight five areas where ML is poised to have such impact. For each, I’ll discuss related research (mostly from 2021) and the directions and progress we’ll likely see in the next few years.

                    <span>Materials processing is the process of turning raw materials into final items through a sequence of phases or “unit operations.” The activities entail a series of industrial processes, including various mechanical and chemical methods, which are often carried out in big numbers or batches.
 Material processing required extensive analysis and classification of complicated microstructures for quality control. For example, the proportion of lath-type bainite in various high-strength steels affects the material’s characteristics. However, recognizing bainite in microstructural images takes time and money because researchers must first employ two types of microscopy to get a closer look, then rely on their own skills to identify bainitic regions.

                    <span>I created my custom, grid(7 by 7) environment to apply RL algorithms. I chose Q-learning and Sarsa, in particular.
 The grid environment consists of 3 types of terminating states: states with negative reward(-100), state with maximum reward(100) and 2 states with half reward(50).
 The main goal of training is for the agent to avoid states with negative rewards and to prefer long-term reward(100) over short-term half reward(50).
 The trained agent works weirdly when the half-rewarded state is closer to the main reward, however, if the half-rewarded states are not that close to the main reward, then both algorithms efficiently train the agent to only go to the main reward.
 So, from what I understand, the result is based on the position of the half-rewarded state.
 My hyperparameters for both Q-learning and Sarsa are the following: epsilon&#x3D;1(that is gradually decayed with a linear function),gamma&#x3D;0.99(I read that for the agent to learn the main reward, the gamma should be high, 0.9-0.99 approx.),alpha&#x3D;0.1
 Can the problem be my environment? I&#x27;m confused because both algorithms work well without the half-rewarded state. So the problem is that depending on where the half-rewarded states are located, the algorithms sometimes don&#x27;t train the agent to choose the long-term reward.
 If someone had a similar problem, I would really appreciate it if you could share how you solved it.

                    <span>As time passes by Artificial Intelligence (A.I.) technology is becoming a bigger thing than ever today. Even though A.I. does come with its benefits like automated machines and etc. I do have a few concerns with A.I. and the negative things about it. A few things I question are firstly self-driving cars.
 Now I know that many people are taking advantage of this relatively new feature, however, we should consider the fact that this is a machine doing the driving. In most cases this system is reliable, but we should still account for the small number of fatalities and issues that came from it malfunctioning.
 In addition to that, another thing I would like to discuss is surgeries. I believe that if AI gets to the point where they are providing health care, they should do simple tasks like gr…</span>

                    <span>What might be the best model(s) for daily time series with annual seasonality (period &#x3D; 365) ? I used auto_arima and it doesn’t support high seasonal periods. It takes forever to fit and then throws a memory error. I read a little about Fourier but not sure how to use that in Python.

 The MineRL BASALT challenge has no reward functions or technical descriptions of what&#x27;s to be achieved. Instead, the goal of each task is given as a short natural language string, and the agent is evaluated by a team of human judges who rate both how well the goal has been fulfilled, as well as how human-like the agent behaved. In this video, I interview KAIROS, the winning team of the 2021 challenge, and discuss how they used a combination of machine learning, efficient data collection, hand engineering, and a bit of knowledge about Minecraft to beat all other teams.

 I&#x27;m setting up a new machine learning project and I know I&#x27;m going to be collecting data over time (and making model improvements). Is there a best way to set up a build system to generate models using my training script, eval on test data, all relatively automatically?
 Curious what other people have tried and liked (or disliked). Thanks!

                    <span>What significance does the MLM loss have when I&#x27;m pre-training Transformers for language modeling from scratch or continue the training of a pre-trained model on a different dataset?
 Apart from initial spikes, I don&#x27;t really see any significant movement in the loss curves. Most papers just evaluate on downstream tasks such as NER or NLI. Is the MLM loss really not that well interpretable?

 In particular, I do not understand the term under the square root. Why is this a standard deviation? Also, what values does alpha take or correspond to. Would appreciate any hints/advice. I did read the paper, but could not get the interpretation for the derivation of the upper confidence bound. Thanks

 I have put up some (not so few) parse trees online as a dataset. Not something as substantial as Penn Treebank, since the trees have not been human-edited. But it is still a lot more parse trees, than those from Penn, to feed into your later-stage NLP algorithms, free of charge or hassle.
 The current format is straight from where they were generated. Suggestions of alternative formats based on ease of use would be heavily appreciated!

                    <span>Tl; dr: A Bayesian ideal-point model for modeling crises in international relations.
 Abstract: &quot;The majority of studies on international conflict escalation use a variety of measures of hostility including the use of force, reciprocity, and the number of fatalities. The use of different measures, however, leads to different empirical results and creates difficulties when testing existing theories of interstate conflict. Furthermore, hostility measures currently used in the conflict literature are ill suited to the task of identifying consistent predictors of international conflict escalation. This article presents a new dyadic latent measure of interstate hostility, created using a Bayesian item-response theory model and conflict data from the Militarized Interstate Dispute (MID) and Phoenix political event datasets. This model (1) provides a more granular, conceptually precise, and validated measure of hostility, which incorporates the uncertainty inherent in the latent variable; and (2) solves the problem of temporal variation in event data using a varying-intercept structure and human-coded data as a benchmark against which biases in machine-coded data are corrected. In addition, this measurement model allows for the systematic evaluation of how existing measures relate to the construct of hostility. The presented model will therefore enhance the ability of researchers to understand factors affecting conflict dynamics, including escalation and de-escalation processes.&quot;

 A fun project that I did to try out OpenAI&#x27;s CLIP model. In this article, I describe a tiny video search engine and indexer that will let you search through a video with descriptive &quot;natural language&quot; queries and find matching frames of video. All the code is included in a Google Colab Notebook. So even if you don&#x27;t have your own cuda-capable GPU, you can easily run the code yourself without setting up anything on your own computer.

 Very happy to announce that as part of the 0.15 release, TensorFlow Similarity now support self-supervised learning using STOA algorithms. To help you get started we included in the release a detailed getting started notebook that you can run in Colab. This notebook shows you how to use SimSiam self-supervised pre-training to almost double the accuracy compared to a model trained from scratch on CIFAR 10.
 Hope you will find this release useful to your research and experimentations :)

                    <span>Hello guys
 I hope you are doing well.
 I am struggling with designing a deep reinforcement learning model, I want to make a model that works with immediate rewards and a final reward at the end of each episode. 
 I am wondering if the final reward must have the same distribution as the immediate rewards? because when I designed an immediate reward that is in the range of [-3,-2] and a final reward in the range of [-1,0] , the agent learns to minimize the reward as the figure below.
 My second question is how the agent differs the final reward and the immediate one?
 Thank you !

                    <span>i&#x27;m having a hard time understanding the PPO algorithm (intuitively). here are the questions i have:
  
what is the gist of calculating the advantage? i know that it&#x27;s calculating the &quot;betterness&quot; of the state/action compared to what the network was actually expecting, but then why is the advantage formula: reward + values_of_next_state - value_of_current_state? how does this tell us how advantageous the current state/action is?
 if the value network is supposed to output the expected/discounted returns (i hope i am not wrong here, or is it supposed to return the reward for just the current state?) then how does it stack up against continuous obs spaces? (eg: in a car game where the input is pixels, i can sample a random state from the whole game then how is it supposed to calculate the discounted returns? it doesn&#x27;t know how far the map goes further or for that matter how far it is from the start of the track).
 how does the gradient affect the action? meaning in a multi discrete action space how does the gradient affect only the action that i took? instead of backproping the grad to all actions?
  
and finally this is how i&#x27;m currently calculating returns and advantages (for a continuous action space and pixel based inputs to the CNN):
 self.values[self.ptr] &#x3D; next_value deltas &#x3D; self.rewards + self.gamma * self.values[1:] - self.values[:-1] self.advantage &#x3D; self.discounted_sum(deltas, self.gamma * self.lam) self.returns &#x3D; self.discounted_sum(self.rewards, self.gamma) 
 am i doing it right?

                    <span>Hi. I used neat-python to make an AI for Pokemon Red, but it doesn&#x27;t get very far. The reward function I made gives it 10 reward every time the RAM values change, as checked every 10 frames. (I made a list of what RAM values it should watch for). I did this because I wanted to try a &quot;curiosity&quot; reward.
 Since the NEAT AI isn&#x27;t getting very far, I decided to try a different algorithm that is not genetic, hoping that it will perform better. I have my eyes on A2C and PPO but I cannot find a way to make a custom reward function for them. It seems that they use the environment&#x27;s reward function, which seems to be only editable in Lua.
 Can someone give me pointers on how to implement a custom reward function for reinforcement learning that is not NEAT? I just need it to take in a list of inputs, output a list, and learn from those and the rewards it gets. I&#x27;ve tried to code the reward function in Lua but I was having issues, so I&#x27;d prefer it to be in Python.

                    <span>Cybersecurity continues to be a top concern for enterprises. Yet the constantly evolving threat landscape that they face makes it harder than ever to be confident in their cybersecurity protections. To address this, ReliaQuest built GreyMatter, an Open XDR-as-a-Service platform that brings together telemetry from any security and business solution, whether on-premises or in one or multiple clouds, to unify detection, investigation, response, and resilience. In 2021, ReliaQuest turned to AWS to help it enhance its artificial intelligence (AI) capabilities and build new features faster.</span>

                    <span>Text-to-Speech (TTS) synthesis is achieved using current voice cloning methods for a new voice. They do not, however, manipulate the expressiveness of synthesized sounds. The task of learning to synthesize the speech of an unseen speaker with the least amount of training is known as voice cloning.
 UC San Diego researchers propose a Controllable voice cloning method that offers fine-grained control over many style features of synthetic speech for an unseen speaker. The voice synthesis model is explicitly conditioned on a speaker encoding, pitch contour, and latent style tokens during training. Continue Reading

                    <span>A team from Google Research, University of Pennsylvania and Cornell University proposes a principled perspective to filter out common memorization for LMs, introducing &quot;counterfactual memorization&quot; to measure the expected change in a model’s prediction and distinguish “rare” (episodic) memorization from “common” (semantic) memorization in neural LMs. 
 Here is a quick read: Counterfactual Memorization in Language Models: Distinguishing Rare from Common Memorization.
 The paper Counterfactual Memorization in Neural Language Models is on arXiv.

                    <span>In a working environment quite often errors are accounted to the contingent/individual because it is considered to be the cheapest fix to blame one rather than rethinking an entire process. Middle-end employees - like project managers - won&#x27;t have anyone to blame if bottom-end employees are all replaced by - not infallible but fair - AI . They&#x27;ll find themselves working for AI and not the other way around. By breaking the the blame cycle, this &quot;fairness&quot; responsibility might backpropagate higher than bottom to mid-end and induce a more radical systematical change.

Friends have been using tools like hyperwrite and speedwrite to get ideas for their writing and assist with drafts, and it seems like more and more people are talking about this as the technology becomes more accessible.

                    <span>Transformers have recently demonstrated promising performance in a variety of visual tests. Inspired by Transformer’s success on a wide range of NLP tasks, Vision Transformer (ViT) first employed a pure Transformer architecture for image classification, demonstrating the promising performance of Transformer architecture for vision tasks.
 However, the quadratic complexity of global self-attention leads to high computing costs and memory use, particularly for high-resolution situations, rendering it unsuitable for use in diverse visual tasks. Various strategies confine the range of attention inside a local region to increase efficiency and lower the quadratic computing complexity generated by global self-attention. As a result, their receptive fields in a single attention layer are insufficiently big, resulting in poor context modeling. 
 A new Pale-Shaped self-Attention (PS-Attention) method executes self-attention inside a pale-shaped zone to solve this issue. Compared to global self-attention, PS-Attention can considerably lower compute and memory expenses. Meanwhile, it can collect more fantastic contextual information while maintaining the same computational complexity as earlier local self-attention techniques. Continue Reading

                    <span>Hello all, I currently have a issue and I&#x27;d like to hear some advice on how to tackle the given problem. I&#x27;m running independent trials, where for each trial a series of variables are recorded at each timestep, where each trial lasts for different periods of time. The outcome of each trial is a single value. I&#x27;d like to predict this single output value given the dynamic timesteps for time series variables. To give a visual example, here is what some data would look like:
 ​

 Each of the first 8 columns represents a variable, where each row represents a different timestep, and each blank row separates the timesteps into chunks, where each chunk is a trial; and the last column is the single value resulting from each trial that I&#x27;d like to predict. Any advice on how to tackle this problem of predicting the last column given a dynamic amount of timesteps for a set of timeseries variables???

                    <span>I was reading section 3.1.D of this paper on re-id and I had a question about this part:
 image of relevant part
 Specifically, both parts are minibatch losses. So why is the 1/Nb loss negative, and why would the 1/Ns loss be positive. Intuitively, the losses are summed, so it should be (-1/Nb)+(-1/Ns) &#x3D; -1/Nb - 1/Ns, right?

                    <span>Hi!
 In my PhD, I studied the design of neural architectures and how to design them without tremendous amounts of trial and error.This lib is my most significant insight compiled into a lightweight package.Simply speaking, I figured out how to predict useless / unproductive layers in CNN architectures.
 This library allows you to easily visualize neural architectures from PyTorch, with unproductive layers highlighted within in the topology. This makes it possible for you to spot inefficiencies within your CNN architecture reliably, without the need for a single training step!

                    <span>Hello everyone ! 
 While working on my PhD, I developed a Python package that I am pretty proud of. 
 It allows you to easily create diverse neural search pipelines with retrievers and pre-trained language models as rankers, and it works flawlessly with middle-sized corpus. 
 It is also currently trending #15 on HackerNews ! Check-it out !

                    <span>Oftentimes I encounter operations that I do not understand as a whole - which can be fixed by simply using dummy arrays and printing them out.
 However, that quickly becomes cumbersome. What do y&#x27;all use to visualize such complex tensor operations quickly and accurately to understand what exactly it accomplishes?

                    <span>Hello all,
 Many of us are having a hard time speeding up our Transformer based NLP models for inference in production.
 So I thought it would be worth writing an article that summarizes the options one should consider (GPU, batch inference, export to ONNX or Torchscript, using TensorRT, Deepspeed, Triton Inference Server... etc.):
 https://nlpcloud.io/how-to-speed-up-deep-learning-nlp-transformers-inference.html
 I hope you&#x27;ll find it useful. If you can think of additional options, please let me know and I&#x27;ll add them to the article!

                    <span>Hi guys, I just programmed my first neural network in Python using keras, but I’m not sure what loss functions and optimizer to use. I used mean squared error, which worked well, but I only have experience in the past using r2, so it’s not optimal. I am currently using ‘Adam’ as my optimizer, but I really don’t understand what this does. I am currently doing regression 28 input neurons leading to 1 output neuron, if that’s helpful. Thanks in advance for the help!

                    <span>I have implemented a Variational Autoencoder using Conv-6 CNN (VGG-* family) as the encoder and decoder with CIFAR-10 in PyTorch. You can refer to the full code here.
 The problem is that the total loss (&#x3D; reconstruction loss + KL-divergence loss) doesn&#x27;t improve. Also, the log-variance is almost 0 indicating further that the multivariate Gaussians being mapped in the latent space is not happening as expected, since the log variance should have values between say -4 to +3, etc. You can see this in this code where the log variance is changing and has a non-zero value.
 Suggestions to alleviate the situation?

                    <span>Hey guys!
 I´m wondering if we can apply Reinforcement Learning where an agent has two action spaces and at time t the agent has to select one of the action spaces (A or B).
 If it selects A there are n tasks that the agent must select one of them. The same for action space B, there are m choices that the agent must select among them.
 It´s a complicated problem. All I want is to know if this is possible?

                    <span>Hey guys, I have implemented and applied the Q-learning algorithm to the simple, grid environment. I defined terminating states, one with positive reward and others with negative rewards. And the training worked pretty well. Now, I wanted to enhance the process by adding the state with half reward,i.e., now there are 3 types of terminating states - a state with the biggest positive reward(100), a state with half of the reward(50), and the state with negative rewards(-100). As I said, they all terminate the process. However, when I test the trained agent, sometimes the agent goes to the state with half reward. So, the process is not as efficient as it was before. Could someone give me any tips on how to approach this problem? Is Q-learning a good approach for short-term vs long-term rewards? Thank you in advance!

                    <span>Hi,
 I have an issue with my algorithm which i can&#x27;t seem to find where the issue lies at. I&#x27;m using RLBench for the environment with Option Critic and DDPG as the agent. I&#x27;m trying out the reach target task. I&#x27;m not sure why but when i looked at the results, the arm ends up curling/trying to return to its initial position when it tries to solve the task at hand. This happened for the open box task as well where it tries to reach the box lid to open it before it swerves and curls up the robot&#x27;s base. Does anyone have any insight as to what is causing this issue?

One of my units is on A.I. and I want to conclude the unit with student debates on topics in AI. I&#x27;m struggling to come up with topic statements however. I know for sure I want one of the topics to be centered on whether A.I. at an advanced level should be afforded the same rights as humans. 
 Any other topic statement ideas? Thanks!

                    <span>Understanding indoor 3D scenes are becoming increasingly important in augmented reality, robotics, photography, games, and real estate. Many state-of-the-art scene interpretation algorithms have lately been driven by modern machine learning approaches. Depth estimation, 3D reconstruction, instance segmentation, object detection, and other methods are used to address distinct aspects of the problem.
 The majority of these studies are made possible by a range of real and synthetic RGB-D datasets that have been made available in recent years. Even though commercially accessible RGB-D sensors, such as Microsoft Kinect, have made the collection of such datasets possible, capturing data at a significant scale with ground truth is still a problematic issue.

                    <span>Admittedly, I am not an expert in machine learning or different libraries but the code I see as an example is not really beginner friendly. Even for an expert, I am not sure, they know all libraries and quircks of different datasets.
 Let me elaborate. The main problem I see is the use of magic numbers. For example, in below hypothetical code
 x &#x3D; dataset[1] 
 there is no indication of why 1 is used instead of 0 or what does it mean. May be 0th elemnt contains metadata/some useless data. Or in other cases, some axis is chosen without specifying why that is used and what are other axis to put in context.
 My only suggestion would be to not ever use a magic number unless it is immediately obvious. Can we not use an appropriately named constant in that case?
 MY_DATA_INDEX&#x3D;1 x &#x3D; dataset[MY_DATA_INDEX] 
 I believe this is a very simple and helpful convention to follow. If such conventions are already there, can someone point me to then? May be people aren&#x27;t just using them too often.

                    <span>Hi everyone, until recently I only had to work on problems for which a single GPU training setup would suffice. But i am working on a problem with a large dataset and I have access to multiple GPUs so I was wondering what&#x27;s the best way to set this up. Going through the PyTorch documentation, they seem to suggest using torch.distributed.run along with DistributedDataParallel for distributed training although I also came across libraries in which the boilerplate stuff is abstracted out such as PyTorch Lightening or DeepSpeed. Since I&#x27;m new to this, I just wanted an opinion on the route I should choose for training my Transformer models in a distributed way. Thanks in advance!

                    <span>Hi all,
 For the last 6 months I have immersed in deep learning problem domain, and have been spending a lot of time catching up on the literature, few courses and doing some personal projects as well.
 But now, I&#x27;m at the point where I&#x27;d like to start contributing in a more meaningful way to the community. Does anyone have idea of good open source projects related to DL (maybe even classic machine learning) that are looking for contributors?
 Thanks for any suggestions!

                    <span>Hello there,
 I am working on a RL environment where an agent moves around in a certain area. At a certain time step, the agent needs to choose the direction of movement (out of 8 choices: up down right left and diagonally). I do get the performance I am expecting in terms of reward/task completion, but the agent&#x27;s movement is just not that smooth (see image below). What are my options here? 
  
I tried continuous action space (2 actions representing forces set on x and y axis), but that did not work really well.

                    <span>Hello Everyone,
 I am trying to implement a RL agent using using PPO with actor/critic. The agent has to move in an x-y plane by setting 2 discretized forces (2 actions) along its x and y axis. Initially I thought I need two output heads for my actor network, one for each action. However I came across this work by OpenAI, where they have a similar agent. They however use one output head for the movement action (along x y and z), where the action has a &quot;multidiscrete&quot; type. Any idea how this works? I have tried to understand it from the gym code but I dont get what &quot;multidiscrete&quot; does? Is it a way of encoding all the combinations of the different actions?
 Any help/insight is really appreciated

                    <span>Anomalous pattern detection aims to identify instances where deviation from
normalcy is evident, and is widely applicable across domains. Multiple
anomalous detection techniques have been proposed in the state of the art.
However, there is a common lack of a principled and scalable feature selection
method for efficient discovery. Existing feature selection techniques are often
conducted by optimizing the performance of prediction outcomes rather than its
systemic deviations from the expected. In this paper, we proposed a
sparsity-based automated feature selection (SAFS) framework, which encodes
systemic outcome deviations via the sparsity of feature-driven odds ratios.
SAFS is a model-agnostic approach with usability across different discovery
techniques. SAFS achieves more than $3\times$ reduction in computation time
while maintaining detection performance when validated on publicly available
critical care dataset. SAFS also results in a superior performance when
compared against multiple baselines for feature selection.</span>

                    <span>Generating images from a single sample, as a newly developing branch of image
synthesis, has attracted extensive attention. In this paper, we formulate this
problem as sampling from the conditional distribution of a single image, and
propose a hierarchical framework that simplifies the learning of the intricate
conditional distributions through the successive learning of the distributions
about structure, semantics and texture, making the process of learning and
generation comprehensible. On this basis, we design ExSinGAN composed of three
cascaded GANs for learning an explainable generative model from a given image,
where the cascaded GANs model the distributions about structure, semantics and
texture successively. ExSinGAN is learned not only from the internal patches of
the given image as the previous works did, but also from the external prior
obtained by the GAN inversion technique. Benefiting from the appropriate
combination of internal and external information, ExSinGAN has a more powerful
capability of generation and competitive generalization ability for the image
manipulation tasks compared with prior works.</span>

                    <span>We present a machine learning system that can quantify fine art paintings
with a set of visual elements and principles of art. This formal analysis is
fundamental for understanding art, but developing such a system is challenging.
Paintings have high visual complexities, but it is also difficult to collect
enough training data with direct labels. To resolve these practical
limitations, we introduce a novel mechanism, called proxy learning, which
learns visual concepts in paintings though their general relation to styles.
This framework does not require any visual annotation, but only uses style
labels and a general relationship between visual concepts and style. In this
paper, we propose a novel proxy model and reformulate four pre-existing methods
in the context of proxy learning. Through quantitative and qualitative
comparison, we evaluate these methods and compare their effectiveness in
quantifying the artistic visual concepts, where the general relationship is
estimated by language models; GloVe or BERT. The language modeling is a
practical and scalable solution requiring no labeling, but it is inevitably
imperfect. We demonstrate how the new proxy model is robust to the
imperfection, while the other models are sensitively affected by it.</span>

                    <span>Zero-Shot Learning (ZSL) aims to transfer classification capability from seen
to unseen classes. Recent methods have proved that generalization and
specialization are two essential abilities to achieve good performance in ZSL.
However, they all focus on only one of the abilities, resulting in models that
are either too general with the degraded classifying ability or too specialized
to generalize to unseen classes. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end
network with balanced generalization and specialization abilities, termed as
BGSNet, to take advantage of both abilities, and balance them at instance- and
dataset-level. Specifically, BGSNet consists of two branches: the
Generalization Network (GNet), which applies episodic meta-learning to learn
generalized knowledge, and the Balanced Specialization Network (BSNet), which
adopts multiple attentive extractors to extract discriminative features and
fulfill the instance-level balance. A novel self-adjusting diversity loss is
designed to optimize BSNet with less redundancy and more diversity. We further
propose a differentiable dataset-level balance and update the weights in a
linear annealing schedule to simulate network pruning and thus obtain the
optimal structure for BSNet at a low cost with dataset-level balance achieved.
Experiments on four benchmark datasets demonstrate our model&#x27;s effectiveness.
Sufficient component ablations prove the necessity of integrating
generalization and specialization abilities.</span>

many computing domains, security issues associated with ML are also emerging.
In the domain of systems security, many endeavors have been made to ensure ML
model and data confidentiality. ML computations are often inevitably performed
in untrusted environments and entail complex multi-party security requirements.
Hence, researchers have leveraged the Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) to
build confidential ML computation systems. We conduct a systematic and
comprehensive survey by classifying attack vectors and mitigation in
confidential ML computation in untrusted environments, analyzing the complex
security requirements in multi-party scenarios, and summarizing engineering
challenges in confidential ML implementation. Lastly, we suggest future

                    <span>The paper introduces a novel conditional independence (CI) based method for
linear and nonlinear, lagged and contemporaneous causal discovery from
observational time series in the causally sufficient case. Existing CI-based
methods such as the PC algorithm and also common methods from other frameworks
suffer from low recall and partially inflated false positives for strong
autocorrelation which is an ubiquitous challenge in time series. The novel
method, PCMCI$^+$, extends PCMCI [Runge et al., 2019b] to include discovery of
contemporaneous links. PCMCI$^+$ improves the reliability of CI tests by
optimizing the choice of conditioning sets and even benefits from
autocorrelation. The method is order-independent and consistent in the oracle
case. A broad range of numerical experiments demonstrates that PCMCI$^+$ has
higher adjacency detection power and especially more contemporaneous
orientation recall compared to other methods while better controlling false
positives. Optimized conditioning sets also lead to much shorter runtimes than
the PC algorithm. PCMCI$^+$ can be of considerable use in many real world
application scenarios where often time resolutions are too coarse to resolve
time delays and strong autocorrelation is present.</span>

                    <span>Classification of long sequential data is an important Machine Learning task
and appears in many application scenarios. Recurrent Neural Networks,
Transformers, and Convolutional Neural Networks are three major techniques for
learning from sequential data. Among these methods, Temporal Convolutional
Networks (TCNs) which are scalable to very long sequences have achieved
remarkable progress in time series regression. However, the performance of TCNs
for sequence classification is not satisfactory because they use a skewed
connection protocol and output classes at the last position. Such asymmetry
restricts their performance for classification which depends on the whole
sequence. In this work, we propose a symmetric multi-scale architecture called
Circular Dilated Convolutional Neural Network (CDIL-CNN), where every position
has an equal chance to receive information from other positions at the previous
layers. Our model gives classification logits in all positions, and we can
apply a simple ensemble learning to achieve a better decision. We have tested
CDIL-CNN on various long sequential datasets. The experimental results show
that our method has superior performance over many state-of-the-art approaches.</span>

                    <span>Spectral clustering is one of the most popular clustering methods. However,
the high computational cost due to the involved eigen-decomposition procedure
can immediately hinder its applications in large-scale tasks. In this paper we
use spectrum-preserving node reduction to accelerate eigen-decomposition and
generate concise representations of data sets. Specifically, we create a small
number of pseudonodes based on spectral similarity. Then, standard spectral
clustering algorithm is performed on the smaller node set. Finally, each data
point in the original data set is assigned to the cluster as its representative
pseudo-node. The proposed framework run in nearly-linear time. Meanwhile, the
clustering accuracy can be significantly improved by mining concise
representations. The experimental results show dramatically improved clustering
performance when compared with state-of-the-art methods.</span>

                    <span>Logistic Bandits have recently undergone careful scrutiny by virtue of their
combined theoretical and practical relevance. This research effort delivered
statistically efficient algorithms, improving the regret of previous strategies
by exponentially large factors. Such algorithms are however strikingly costly
as they require $\Omega(t)$ operations at each round. On the other hand, a
different line of research focused on computational efficiency
($\mathcal{O}(1)$ per-round cost), but at the cost of letting go of the
aforementioned exponential improvements. Obtaining the best of both world is
unfortunately not a matter of marrying both approaches. Instead we introduce a
new learning procedure for Logistic Bandits. It yields confidence sets which
sufficient statistics can be easily maintained online without sacrificing
statistical tightness. Combined with efficient planning mechanisms we design
fast algorithms which regret performance still match the problem-dependent
lower-bound of Abeille et al. (2021). To the best of our knowledge, those are
the first Logistic Bandit algorithms that simultaneously enjoy statistical and
computational efficiency.</span>

                    <span>Existed pre-trained models have achieved state-of-the-art performance on
various text classification tasks. These models have proven to be useful in
learning universal language representations. However, the semantic discrepancy
between similar texts cannot be effectively distinguished by advanced
pre-trained models, which have a great influence on the performance of
hard-to-distinguish classes. To address this problem, we propose a novel
Contrastive Learning with Label Distance (CLLD) in this work. Inspired by
recent advances in contrastive learning, we specifically design a
classification method with label distance for learning contrastive classes.
CLLD ensures the flexibility within the subtle differences that lead to
different label assignments, and generates the distinct representations for
each class having similarity simultaneously. Extensive experiments on public
benchmarks and internal datasets demonstrate that our method improves the
performance of pre-trained models on classification tasks. Importantly, our
experiments suggest that the learned label distance relieve the adversarial
nature of interclasses.</span>

                    <span>The non-convexity of the artificial neural network (ANN) training landscape
brings inherent optimization difficulties. While the traditional
back-propagation stochastic gradient descent (SGD) algorithm and its variants
are effective in certain cases, they can become stuck at spurious local minima
and are sensitive to initializations and hyperparameters. Recent work has shown
that the training of an ANN with ReLU activations can be reformulated as a
convex program, bringing hope to globally optimizing interpretable ANNs.
However, naively solving the convex training formulation has an exponential
complexity, and even an approximation heuristic requires cubic time. In this
work, we characterize the quality of this approximation and develop two
efficient algorithms that train ANNs with global convergence guarantees. The
first algorithm is based on the alternating direction method of multiplier
(ADMM). It solves both the exact convex formulation and the approximate
counterpart. Linear global convergence is achieved, and the initial several
iterations often yield a solution with high prediction accuracy. When solving
the approximate formulation, the per-iteration time complexity is quadratic.
The second algorithm, based on the &quot;sampled convex programs&quot; theory, is simpler
to implement. It solves unconstrained convex formulations and converges to an
approximately globally optimal classifier. The non-convexity of the ANN
training landscape exacerbates when adversarial training is considered. We
apply the robust convex optimization theory to convex training and develop
convex formulations that train ANNs robust to adversarial inputs. Our analysis
explicitly focuses on one-hidden-layer fully connected ANNs, but can extend to
more sophisticated architectures.</span>

                    <span>What is learning? 20$^{st}$ century formalizations of learning theory --
which precipitated revolutions in artificial intelligence -- focus primarily on
$\mathit{in-distribution}$ learning, that is, learning under the assumption
that the training data are sampled from the same distribution as the evaluation
distribution. This assumption renders these theories inadequate for
characterizing 21$^{st}$ century real world data problems, which are typically
characterized by evaluation distributions that differ from the training data
distributions (referred to as out-of-distribution learning). We therefore make
a small change to existing formal definitions of learnability by relaxing that
assumption. We then introduce $\mathbf{learning\ efficiency}$ (LE) to quantify
the amount a learner is able to leverage data for a given problem, regardless
of whether it is an in- or out-of-distribution problem. We then define and
prove the relationship between generalized notions of learnability, and show
how this framework is sufficiently general to characterize transfer, multitask,
meta, continual, and lifelong learning. We hope this unification helps bridge
the gap between empirical practice and theoretical guidance in real world
problems. Finally, because biological learning continues to outperform machine
learning algorithms on certain OOD challenges, we discuss the limitations of
this framework vis-\&#x27;a-vis its ability to formalize biological learning,
suggesting multiple avenues for future research.</span>

                    <span>Spectral clustering has been one of the widely used methods for community
detection in networks. However, large-scale networks bring computational
challenges to the eigenvalue decomposition therein. In this paper, we study the
spectral clustering using randomized sketching algorithms from a statistical
perspective, where we typically assume the network data are generated from a
stochastic block model that is not necessarily of full rank. To do this, we
first use the recently developed sketching algorithms to obtain two randomized
spectral clustering algorithms, namely, the random projection-based and the
random sampling-based spectral clustering. Then we study the theoretical bounds
of the resulting algorithms in terms of the approximation error for the
population adjacency matrix, the misclassification error, and the estimation
error for the link probability matrix. It turns out that, under mild
conditions, the randomized spectral clustering algorithms lead to the same
theoretical bounds as those of the original spectral clustering algorithm. We
also extend the results to degree-corrected stochastic block models. Numerical
experiments support our theoretical findings and show the efficiency of
randomized methods. A new R package called Rclust is developed and made
available to the public.</span>

                    <span>We study the selection of adjustment sets for estimating the interventional
mean under an individualized treatment rule. We assume a non-parametric causal
graphical model with, possibly, hidden variables and at least one adjustment
set comprised of observable variables. Moreover, we assume that observable
variables have positive costs associated with them. We define the cost of an
observable adjustment set as the sum of the costs of the variables that
comprise it. We show that in this setting there exist adjustment sets that are
minimum cost optimal, in the sense that they yield non-parametric estimators of
the interventional mean with the smallest asymptotic variance among those that
control for observable adjustment sets that have minimum cost. Our results are
based on the construction of a special flow network associated with the
original causal graph. We show that a minimum cost optimal adjustment set can
be found by computing a maximum flow on the network, and then finding the set
of vertices that are reachable from the source by augmenting paths. The
optimaladj Python package implements the algorithms introduced in this paper.</span>

                    <span>Most modern approaches for domain adaptive semantic segmentation rely on
continued access to source data during adaptation, which may be infeasible due
to computational or privacy constraints. We focus on source-free domain
adaptation for semantic segmentation, wherein a source model must adapt itself
to a new target domain given only unlabeled target data. We propose
Augmentation Consistency-guided Self-training (AUGCO), a source-free adaptation
algorithm that uses the model&#x27;s pixel-level predictive consistency across
diverse, automatically generated views of each target image along with model
confidence to identify reliable pixel predictions, and selectively self-trains
on those. AUGCO achieves state-of-the-art results for source-free adaptation on
3 standard benchmarks for semantic segmentation, all within a simple to
implement and fast to converge method.</span>

within a polarised social group. We leverage the voter model in which users
hold binary opinions and repeatedly update their beliefs based on others they
connect with. Stubborn agents who never change their minds (&quot;zealots&quot;) are also
disseminated through the network, which is modelled by a connected graph.
Building on earlier results, we provide a closed-form expression for the
average opinion of the group at equilibrium. This leads us to a strategy to
inject zealots into a polarised network in order to shift the average opinion
towards any target value. We account for the possible presence of a backfire
effect, which may lead the group to react negatively and reinforce its level of
polarisation in response. Our results are supported by numerical experiments on

                    <span>Autoencoders are the simplest neural network for unsupervised learning, and
thus an ideal framework for studying feature learning. While a detailed
understanding of the dynamics of linear autoencoders has recently been
obtained, the study of non-linear autoencoders has been hindered by the
technical difficulty of handling training data with non-trivial correlations -
a fundamental prerequisite for feature extraction. Here, we study the dynamics
of feature learning in non-linear, shallow autoencoders. We derive a set of
asymptotically exact equations that describe the generalisation dynamics of
autoencoders trained with stochastic gradient descent (SGD) in the limit of
high-dimensional inputs. These equations reveal that autoencoders learn the
leading principal components of their inputs sequentially. An analysis of the
long-time dynamics explains the failure of sigmoidal autoencoders to learn with
tied weights, and highlights the importance of training the bias in ReLU
autoencoders. Building on previous results for linear networks, we analyse a
modification of the vanilla SGD algorithm which allows learning of the exact
principal components. Finally, we show that our equations accurately describe
the generalisation dynamics of non-linear autoencoders on realistic datasets
such as CIFAR10.</span>

                    <span>Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) aims to transfer and adapt knowledge
from a labeled source domain to an unlabeled target domain. Traditionally,
subspace-based methods form an important class of solutions to this problem.
Despite their mathematical elegance and tractability, these methods are often
found to be ineffective at producing domain-invariant features with complex,
real-world datasets. Motivated by the recent advances in representation
learning with deep networks, this paper revisits the use of subspace alignment
for UDA and proposes a novel adaptation algorithm that consistently leads to
improved generalization. In contrast to existing adversarial training-based DA
methods, our approach isolates feature learning and distribution alignment
steps, and utilizes a primary-auxiliary optimization strategy to effectively
balance the objectives of domain invariance and model fidelity. While providing
a significant reduction in target data and computational requirements, our
subspace-based DA performs competitively and sometimes even outperforms
state-of-the-art approaches on several standard UDA benchmarks. Furthermore,
subspace alignment leads to intrinsically well-regularized models that
demonstrate strong generalization even in the challenging partial DA setting.
Finally, the design of our UDA framework inherently supports progressive
adaptation to new target domains at test-time, without requiring retraining of
the model from scratch. In summary, powered by powerful feature learners and an
effective optimization strategy, we establish subspace-based DA as a highly
effective approach for visual recognition.</span>

otherwise intractable. We consider an agent who is designed to attain a low
information ratio with respect to a bandit environment with a Gaussian prior
distribution and a Gaussian likelihood function, but study the agent&#x27;s
performance when applied instead to a Bernoulli bandit. We establish a bound on
the increase in Bayesian regret when an agent interacts with the Bernoulli
bandit, relative to an information-theoretic bound satisfied with the Gaussian
bandit. If the Gaussian prior distribution and likelihood function are
sufficiently diffuse, this increase grows with the square-root of the time
horizon, and thus the per-timestep increase vanishes. Our results formalize the
folklore that so-called Bayesian agents remain effective when instantiated with
diffuse misspecified distributions.</span>

                    <span>Automated scoring of free drawings or images as responses has yet to be
utilized in large-scale assessments of student achievement. In this study, we
propose artificial neural networks to classify these types of graphical
responses from a computer based international mathematics and science
assessment. We are comparing classification accuracy of convolutional and
feedforward approaches. Our results show that convolutional neural networks
(CNNs) outperform feedforward neural networks in both loss and accuracy. The
CNN models classified up to 97.71% of the image responses into the appropriate
scoring category, which is comparable to, if not more accurate, than typical
human raters. These findings were further strengthened by the observation that
the most accurate CNN models correctly classified some image responses that had
been incorrectly scored by the human raters. As an additional innovation, we
outline a method to select human rated responses for the training sample based
on an application of the expected response function derived from item response
theory. This paper argues that CNN-based automated scoring of image responses
is a highly accurate procedure that could potentially replace the workload and
cost of second human raters for large scale assessments, while improving the
validity and comparability of scoring complex constructed-response items.</span>

                    <span>A key challenge in the study of multiagent cooperation is the need for
individual agents not only to cooperate effectively, but to decide with whom to
cooperate. This is particularly critical in situations when other agents have
hidden, possibly misaligned motivations and goals. Social deduction games offer
an avenue to study how individuals might learn to synthesize potentially
unreliable information about others, and elucidate their true motivations. In
this work, we present Hidden Agenda, a two-team social deduction game that
provides a 2D environment for studying learning agents in scenarios of unknown
team alignment. The environment admits a rich set of strategies for both teams.
Reinforcement learning agents trained in Hidden Agenda show that agents can
learn a variety of behaviors, including partnering and voting without need for

                    <span>Implicit neural networks have been successfully used for surface
reconstruction from point clouds. However, many of them face scalability issues
as they encode the isosurface function of a whole object or scene into a single
latent vector. To overcome this limitation, a few approaches infer latent
vectors on a coarse regular 3D grid or on 3D patches, and interpolate them to
answer occupancy queries. In doing so, they loose the direct connection with
the input points sampled on the surface of objects, and they attach information
uniformly in space rather than where it matters the most, i.e., near the
surface. Besides, relying on fixed patch sizes may require discretization
tuning. To address these issues, we propose to use point cloud convolutions and
compute latent vectors at each input point. We then perform a learning-based
interpolation on nearest neighbors using inferred weights. Experiments on both
object and scene datasets show that our approach significantly outperforms
other methods on most classical metrics, producing finer details and better
reconstructing thinner volumes. The code is available at

Previous work has defined optimality as achieving the smallest asymptotic
estimation variance and derived an optimal set for the case without hidden
variables. For the case with hidden variables there can be settings where no
optimal set exists and currently only a sufficient graphical optimality
criterion of limited applicability has been derived. In the present work
optimality is characterized as maximizing a certain adjustment information
which allows to derive a necessary and sufficient graphical criterion for the
existence of an optimal adjustment set and a definition and algorithm to
construct it. Further, the optimal set is valid if and only if a valid
adjustment set exists and has higher (or equal) adjustment information than the
Adjust-set proposed in Perkovi{\&#x27;c} et al. [Journal of Machine Learning
Research, 18: 1--62, 2018] for any graph. The results translate to minimal
asymptotic estimation variance for a class of estimators whose asymptotic
variance follows a certain information-theoretic relation. Numerical
experiments indicate that the asymptotic results also hold for relatively small
sample sizes and that the optimal adjustment set or minimized variants thereof
often yield better variance also beyond that estimator class. Surprisingly,
among the randomly created setups more than 90\% fulfill the optimality
conditions indicating that also in many real-world scenarios graphical
optimality may hold. Code is available as part of the python package

                    <span>This paper explores a better codebook for BERT pre-training of vision
transformers. The recent work BEiT successfully transfers BERT pre-training
from NLP to the vision field. It directly adopts one simple discrete VAE as the
visual tokenizer, but has not considered the semantic level of the resulting
visual tokens. By contrast, the discrete tokens in NLP field are naturally
highly semantic. This difference motivates us to learn a perceptual codebook.
And we surprisingly find one simple yet effective idea: enforcing perceptual
similarity during the dVAE training. We demonstrate that the visual tokens
generated by the proposed perceptual codebook do exhibit better semantic
meanings, and subsequently help pre-training achieve superior transfer
performance in various downstream tasks. For example, we achieve 84.5% Top-1
accuracy on ImageNet-1K with ViT-B backbone, outperforming the competitive
method BEiT by +1.3 with the same pre-training epochs. It can also improve the
performance of object detection and segmentation tasks on COCO val by +1.3 box
AP and +1.0 mask AP, semantic segmentation on ADE20k by +1.0 mIoU. Equipped
with a larger backbone ViT-H, we achieve the state-of-the-art performance
(88.3% Top-1 accuracy) among the methods using only ImageNet-1K data. The code

                    <span>In recent years, large pre-trained deep neural networks (DNNs) have
revolutionized the field of computer vision (CV). Although these DNNs have been
shown to be very well suited for general image recognition tasks, application
in industry is often precluded for three reasons: 1) large pre-trained DNNs are
built on hundreds of millions of parameters, making deployment on many devices
impossible, 2) the underlying dataset for pre-training consists of general
objects, while industrial cases often consist of very specific objects, such as
structures on solar wafers, 3) potentially biased pre-trained DNNs raise legal
issues for companies. As a remedy, we study neural networks for CV that we
train from scratch. For this purpose, we use a real-world case from a solar
wafer manufacturer. We find that our neural networks achieve similar
performances as pre-trained DNNs, even though they consist of far fewer
parameters and do not rely on third-party datasets.</span>

                    <span>Estimating value functions is a core component of reinforcement learning
algorithms. Temporal difference (TD) learning algorithms use bootstrapping,
i.e. they update the value function toward a learning target using value
estimates at subsequent time-steps. Alternatively, the value function can be
updated toward a learning target constructed by separately predicting successor
features (SF)--a policy-dependent model--and linearly combining them with
instantaneous rewards. We focus on bootstrapping targets used when estimating
value functions, and propose a new backup target, the $\eta$-return mixture,
which implicitly combines value-predictive knowledge (used by TD methods) with
(successor) feature-predictive knowledge--with a parameter $\eta$ capturing how
much to rely on each. We illustrate that incorporating predictive knowledge
through an $\eta\gamma$-discounted SF model makes more efficient use of sampled
experience, compared to either extreme, i.e. bootstrapping entirely on the
value function estimate, or bootstrapping on the product of separately
estimated successor features and instantaneous reward models. We empirically
show this approach leads to faster policy evaluation and better control
performance, for tabular and nonlinear function approximations, indicating
scalability and generality.</span>

                    <span>We study the online influence maximization (OIM) problem in social networks,
where in multiple rounds the learner repeatedly chooses seed nodes to generate
cascades, observes the cascade feedback, and gradually learns the best seeds
that generate the largest cascade. We focus on two major challenges in this
paper. First, we work with node-level feedback instead of edge-level feedback.
The edge-level feedback reveals all edges that pass through information in a
cascade, where the node-level feedback only reveals the activated nodes with
timestamps. The node-level feedback is arguably more realistic since in
practice it is relatively easy to observe who is influenced but very difficult
to observe from which relationship (edge) the influence comes from. Second, we
use standard offline oracle instead of offline pair-oracle. To compute a good
seed set for the next round, an offline pair-oracle finds the best seed set and
the best parameters within the confidence region simultaneously, and such an
oracle is difficult to compute due to the combinatorial core of OIM problem. So
we focus on how to use the standard offline influence maximization oracle which
finds the best seed set given the edge parameters as input. In this paper, we
resolve these challenges for the two most popular diffusion models, the
independent cascade (IC) and the linear threshold (LT) model. For the IC model,
the past research only achieves edge-level feedback, while we present the first
$\widetilde{O}(\sqrt{T})$-regret algorithm for the node-level feedback.
Besides, the algorithm only invokes standard offline oracles. For the LT model,
a recent study only provides an OIM solution that meets the first challenge but
still requires a pair-oracle. In this paper, we apply a similar technique as in
the IC model to replace the pair-oracle with a standard oracle while
maintaining $\widetilde{O}(\sqrt{T})$-regret.</span>

                    <span>The Resource Description Framework (RDF) is a framework for describing
metadata, such as attributes and relationships of resources on the Web. Machine
learning tasks for RDF graphs adopt three methods: (i) support vector machines
(SVMs) with RDF graph kernels, (ii) RDF graph embeddings, and (iii) relational
graph convolutional networks. In this paper, we propose a novel feature vector
(called a Skip vector) that represents some features of each resource in an RDF
graph by extracting various combinations of neighboring edges and nodes. In
order to make the Skip vector low-dimensional, we select important features for
classification tasks based on the information gain ratio of each feature. The
classification tasks can be performed by applying the low-dimensional Skip
vector of each resource to conventional machine learning algorithms, such as
SVMs, the k-nearest neighbors method, neural networks, random forests, and
AdaBoost. In our evaluation experiments with RDF data, such as Wikidata,
DBpedia, and YAGO, we compare our method with RDF graph kernels in an SVM. We
also compare our method with the two approaches: RDF graph embeddings such as
RDF2vec and relational graph convolutional networks on the AIFB, MUTAG, BGS,

community. Analysing the sentiments and opinions of the common public is very

behind the activeness of many media agencies during the election time for
performing various kinds of opinion polls. In this paper, we have worked
towards analysing the sentiments of the people of India during the Lok Sabha

automatic tweet analyser using the Transfer Learning technique to handle the
unsupervised nature of this problem. We have used the Linear Support Vector

Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) methodology for handling the textual data

the sarcastic tweets posted by some of the users, which has not been yet

                    <span>A deep learning-based model reduction (DeePMR) method for simplifying
chemical kinetics is proposed and validated using high-temperature
auto-ignitions, perfectly stirred reactors (PSR), and one-dimensional freely
propagating flames of n-heptane/air mixtures. The mechanism reduction is
modeled as an optimization problem on Boolean space, where a Boolean vector,
each entry corresponding to a species, represents a reduced mechanism. The
optimization goal is to minimize the reduced mechanism size given the error
tolerance of a group of pre-selected benchmark quantities. The key idea of the
DeePMR is to employ a deep neural network (DNN) to formulate the objective
function in the optimization problem. In order to explore high dimensional
Boolean space efficiently, an iterative DNN-assisted data sampling and DNN
training procedure are implemented. The results show that DNN-assistance
improves sampling efficiency significantly, selecting only $10^5$ samples out
of $10^{34}$ possible samples for DNN to achieve sufficient accuracy. The
results demonstrate the capability of the DNN to recognize key species and
reasonably predict reduced mechanism performance. The well-trained DNN
guarantees the optimal reduced mechanism by solving an inverse optimization
problem. By comparing ignition delay times, laminar flame speeds, temperatures
in PSRs, the resulting skeletal mechanism has fewer species (45 species) but
the same level of accuracy as the skeletal mechanism (56 species) obtained by
the Path Flux Analysis (PFA) method. In addition, the skeletal mechanism can be
further reduced to 28 species if only considering atmospheric,
near-stoichiometric conditions (equivalence ratio between 0.6 and 1.2). The
DeePMR provides an innovative way to perform model reduction and demonstrates
the great potential of data-driven methods in the combustion area.</span>

                    <span>The paper describes the use of Bayesian regression for building time series
models and stacking different predictive models for time series. Using Bayesian
regression for time series modeling with nonlinear trend was analyzed. This
approach makes it possible to estimate an uncertainty of time series prediction
and calculate value at risk characteristics. A hierarchical model for time
series using Bayesian regression has been considered. In this approach, one set
of parameters is the same for all data samples, other parameters can be
different for different groups of data samples. Such an approach allows using
this model in the case of short historical data for specified time series, e.g.
in the case of new stores or new products in the sales prediction problem. In
the study of predictive models stacking, the models ARIMA, Neural Network,
Random Forest, Extra Tree were used for the prediction on the first level of
model ensemble. On the second level, time series predictions of these models on
the validation set were used for stacking by Bayesian regression. This approach
gives distributions for regression coefficients of these models. It makes it
possible to estimate the uncertainty contributed by each model to stacking
result. The information about these distributions allows us to select an
optimal set of stacking models, taking into account the domain knowledge. The
probabilistic approach for stacking predictive models allows us to make risk
assessment for the predictions that are important in a decision-making process.</span>

studies, hidden confounders, which are factors that affect both item exposures
and user ratings, lead to a systematic bias in the estimation. Consequently, a
new trend in recommender system research is to negate the influence of
confounders from a causal perspective. Observing that confounders in
recommendations are usually shared among items and are therefore multi-cause
confounders, we model the recommendation as a multi-cause multi-outcome (MCMO)
inference problem. Specifically, to remedy confounding bias, we estimate
user-specific latent variables that render the item exposures independent
Bernoulli trials. The generative distribution is parameterized by a DNN with
factorized logistic likelihood and the intractable posteriors are estimated by
variational inference. Controlling these factors as substitute confounders,
under mild assumptions, can eliminate the bias incurred by multi-cause
confounders. Furthermore, we show that MCMO modeling may lead to high variance
due to scarce observations associated with the high-dimensional causal space.
Fortunately, we theoretically demonstrate that introducing user features as
pre-treatment variables can substantially improve sample efficiency and
alleviate overfitting. Empirical studies on simulated and real-world datasets
show that the proposed deep causal recommender shows more robustness to
unobserved confounders than state-of-the-art causal recommenders. Codes and
datasets are released at https://github.com/yaochenzhu/deep-deconf.</span>

hate-speech texts in Hindi and Bengali. We also explore how transfer learning
can be applied to learning these languages, given that they have the same
origin and thus, are similar to some extend. Even though the whole experiment
was conducted with low computational power, the obtained result is comparable
to the results of other, more expensive, models. Furthermore, since the
training data in use is relatively small and the two languages are almost
entirely unknown to us, this work can be generalized as an effort to demystify
lost or alien languages that no human is capable of understanding.</span>

                    <span>Machine learning can be enhanced through the integration of external
knowledge. This method, called knowledge informed machine learning, is also
applicable within the field of Prognostics and Health Management (PHM). In this
paper, the various methods of knowledge informed machine learning, from a PHM
context, are reviewed with the goal of helping the reader understand the
domain. In addition, a knowledge informed machine learning technique is
demonstrated, using the common IMS and PRONOSTIA bearing data sets, for
remaining useful life (RUL) prediction. Specifically, knowledge is garnered
from the field of reliability engineering which is represented through the
Weibull distribution. The knowledge is then integrated into a neural network
through a novel Weibull-based loss function. A thorough statistical analysis of
the Weibull-based loss function is conducted, demonstrating the effectiveness
of the method on the PRONOSTIA data set. However, the Weibull-based loss
function is less effective on the IMS data set. The results, shortcomings, and
benefits of the approach are discussed in length. Finally, all the code is
publicly available for the benefit of other researchers.</span>

                    <span>The article describes the use of deep Q-learning models in the problems of
sales time series analytics. In contrast to supervised machine learning which
is a kind of passive learning using historical data, Q-learning is a kind of
active learning with goal to maximize a reward by optimal sequence of actions.
Model free Q-learning approach for optimal pricing strategies and supply-demand
problems was considered in the work. The main idea of the study is to show that
using deep Q-learning approach in time series analytics, the sequence of
actions can be optimized by maximizing the reward function when the environment
for learning agent interaction can be modeled using the parametric model and in
the case of using the model which is based on the historical data. In the
pricing optimizing case study environment was modeled using sales dependence on
extras price and randomly simulated demand. In the pricing optimizing case
study, the environment was modeled using sales dependence on extra price and
randomly simulated demand. In the supply-demand case study, it was proposed to
use historical demand time series for environment modeling, agent states were
represented by promo actions, previous demand values and weekly seasonality
features. Obtained results show that using deep Q-learning, we can optimize the
decision making process for price optimization and supply-demand problems.
Environment modeling using parametric models and historical data can be used
for the cold start of learning agent. On the next steps, after the cold start,
the trained agent can be used in real business environment.</span>

                    <span>The problem of linear predictions has been extensively studied for the past
century under pretty generalized frameworks. Recent advances in the robust
statistics literature allow us to analyze robust versions of classical linear
models through the prism of Median of Means (MoM). Combining these approaches
in a piecemeal way might lead to ad-hoc procedures, and the restricted
theoretical conclusions that underpin each individual contribution may no
longer be valid. To meet these challenges coherently, in this study, we offer a
unified robust framework that includes a broad variety of linear prediction
problems on a Hilbert space, coupled with a generic class of loss functions.
Notably, we do not require any assumptions on the distribution of the outlying
data points ($\mathcal{O}$) nor the compactness of the support of the inlying
ones ($\mathcal{I}$). Under mild conditions on the dual norm, we show that for
misspecification level $\epsilon$, these estimators achieve an error rate of
$O(\max\left\{|\mathcal{O}|^{1/2}n^{-1/2}, |\mathcal{I}|^{1/2}n^{-1}
\right\}+\epsilon)$, matching the best-known rates in literature. This rate is
slightly slower than the classical rates of $O(n^{-1/2})$, indicating that we
need to pay a price in terms of error rates to obtain robust estimates.
Additionally, we show that this rate can be improved to achieve so-called
&#x60;&#x60;fast rates&quot; under additional assumptions.</span>

end-to-end generation of RF/mm-wave passive matching network with 3D EM

target circuit component values and target topologies, our proposed approach
achieves the direct synthesis of the passive network given the network topology
from desired performance values as input. We showcase the proposed synthesis
Neural Network (NN) model on an on-chip 1:1 transformer-based impedance
matching network. By leveraging parameter sharing, the synthesis NN model
successfully extracts relevant features from the input impedance and load
capacitors, and predict the transformer 3D EM geometry in a 45nm SOI process
that will match the standard 50$\Omega$ load to the target input impedance
while absorbing the two loading capacitors. As a proof-of-concept, several
example transformer geometries were synthesized, and verified in Ansys HFSS to
provide the desired input impedance.</span>

trials, through the use of covariates correlated with the outcome but

treatment effect estimator, which we call MLRATE. MLRATE uses machine learning
predictors of the outcome to reduce estimator variance. It employs
cross-fitting to avoid overfitting biases, and we prove consistency and
asymptotic normality under general conditions. MLRATE is robust to poor
predictions from the machine learning step: if the predictions are uncorrelated
with the outcomes, the estimator performs asymptotically no worse than the
standard difference-in-means estimator, while if predictions are highly
correlated with outcomes, the efficiency gains are large. In A/A tests, for a
set of 48 outcome metrics commonly monitored in Facebook experiments the
estimator has over 70% lower variance than the simple difference-in-means
estimator, and about 19% lower variance than the common univariate procedure
which adjusts only for pre-experiment values of the outcome.</span>

                    <span>Exploiting sparsity is a key technique in accelerating quantized
convolutional neural network (CNN) inference on mobile devices. Prior sparse
CNN accelerators largely exploit un-structured sparsity and achieve significant
speedups. Due to the unbounded, largely unpredictable sparsity patterns,
however, exploiting unstructured sparsity requires complicated hardware design
with significant energy and area overhead, which is particularly detrimental to
mobile/IoT inference scenarios where energy and area efficiency are crucial. We
propose to exploit structured sparsity, more specifically, Density Bound Block
(DBB) sparsity for both weights and activations. DBB block tensors bound the
maximum number of non-zeros per block. DBB thus exposes statically predictable
sparsity patterns that enable lean sparsity-exploiting hardware. We propose new
hardware primitives to implement DBB sparsity for (static) weights and
(dynamic) activations, respectively, with very low overheads. Building on top
of the primitives, we describe S2TA, a systolic array-based CNN accelerator
that exploits joint weight and activation DBB sparsity and new dimensions of
data reuse unavailable on the traditional systolic array. S2TA in 16nm achieves
more than 2x speedup and energy reduction compared to a strong baseline of a
systolic array with zero-value clock gating, over five popular CNN benchmarks.
Compared to two recent non-systolic sparse accelerators, Eyeriss v2 (65nm) and
SparTen (45nm), S2TA in 65nm uses about 2.2x and 3.1x less energy per
inference, respectively.</span>

                    <span>In this work, we study empirical risk minimization (ERM) within a federated
learning framework, where a central server minimizes an ERM objective function
using training data that is stored across $m$ clients. In this setting, the
Federated Averaging (FedAve) algorithm is the staple for determining
$\epsilon$-approximate solutions to the ERM problem. Similar to standard
optimization algorithms, the convergence analysis of FedAve only relies on
smoothness of the loss function in the optimization parameter. However, loss
functions are often very smooth in the training data too. To exploit this
additional smoothness, we propose the Federated Low Rank Gradient Descent
(FedLRGD) algorithm. Since smoothness in data induces an approximate low rank
structure on the loss function, our method first performs a few rounds of
communication between the server and clients to learn weights that the server
can use to approximate clients&#x27; gradients. Then, our method solves the ERM
problem at the server using inexact gradient descent. To show that FedLRGD can
have superior performance to FedAve, we present a notion of federated oracle
complexity as a counterpart to canonical oracle complexity. Under some
assumptions on the loss function, e.g., strong convexity in parameter,
$\eta$-H\&quot;older smoothness in data, etc., we prove that the federated oracle
complexity of FedLRGD scales like $\phi m(p/\epsilon)^{\Theta(d/\eta)}$ and
that of FedAve scales like $\phi m(p/\epsilon)^{3/4}$ (neglecting sub-dominant
factors), where $\phi\gg 1$ is a &quot;communication-to-computation ratio,&quot; $p$ is
the parameter dimension, and $d$ is the data dimension. Then, we show that when
$d$ is small and the loss function is sufficiently smooth in the data, FedLRGD
beats FedAve in federated oracle complexity. Finally, in the course of
analyzing FedLRGD, we also establish a result on low rank approximation of
latent variable models.</span>

                    <span>We consider reinforcement learning (RL) in Markov Decision Processes in which
an agent repeatedly interacts with an environment that is modeled by a
controlled Markov process. At each time step $t$, it earns a reward, and also
incurs a cost-vector consisting of $M$ costs. We design model-based RL
algorithms that maximize the cumulative reward earned over a time horizon of
$T$ time-steps, while simultaneously ensuring that the average values of the
$M$ cost expenditures are bounded by agent-specified thresholds
$c^{ub}_i,i&#x3D;1,2,\ldots,M$.

In order to measure the performance of a reinforcement learning algorithm
that satisfies the average cost constraints, we define an $M+1$ dimensional
regret vector that is composed of its reward regret, and $M$ cost regrets. The
reward regret measures the sub-optimality in the cumulative reward, while the
$i$-th component of the cost regret vector is the difference between its $i$-th
cumulative cost expense and the expected cost expenditures $Tc^{ub}_i$.

We prove that the expected value of the regret vector of UCRL-CMDP, is
upper-bounded as $\tilde{O}\left(T^{2\slash 3}\right)$, where $T$ is the time
horizon. We further show how to reduce the regret of a desired subset of the
$M$ costs, at the expense of increasing the regrets of rewards and the
remaining costs. To the best of our knowledge, ours is the only work that
considers non-episodic RL under average cost constraints, and derive algorithms
that can~\emph{tune the regret vector} according to the agent&#x27;s requirements on
its cost regrets.</span>

                    <span>We present Contrastive Neighborhood Alignment (CNA), a manifold learning
approach to maintain the topology of learned features whereby data points that
are mapped to nearby representations by the source (teacher) model are also
mapped to neighbors by the target (student) model. The target model aims to
mimic the local structure of the source representation space using a
contrastive loss. CNA is an unsupervised learning algorithm that does not
require ground-truth labels for the individual samples. CNA is illustrated in
three scenarios: manifold learning, where the model maintains the local
topology of the original data in a dimension-reduced space; model distillation,
where a small student model is trained to mimic a larger teacher; and legacy
model update, where an older model is replaced by a more powerful one.
Experiments show that CNA is able to capture the manifold in a high-dimensional
space and improves performance compared to the competing methods in their
domains.</span>

                    <span>Differentiable solvers for the linear assignment problem (LAP) have attracted
much research attention in recent years, which are usually embedded into
learning frameworks as components. However, previous algorithms, with or
without learning strategies, usually suffer from the degradation of the
optimality with the increment of the problem size. In this paper, we propose a
learnable linear assignment solver based on deep graph networks. Specifically,
we first transform the cost matrix to a bipartite graph and convert the
assignment task to the problem of selecting reliable edges from the constructed
graph. Subsequently, a deep graph network is developed to aggregate and update
the features of nodes and edges. Finally, the network predicts a label for each
edge that indicates the assignment relationship. The experimental results on a
synthetic dataset reveal that our method outperforms state-of-the-art baselines
and achieves consistently high accuracy with the increment of the problem size.
Furthermore, we also embed the proposed solver, in comparison with
state-of-the-art baseline solvers, into a popular multi-object tracking (MOT)
framework to train the tracker in an end-to-end manner. The experimental
results on MOT benchmarks illustrate that the proposed LAP solver improves the
tracker by the largest margin.</span>

                    <span>Graph-based Anomaly Detection (GAD) is becoming prevalent due to the powerful
representation abilities of graphs as well as recent advances in graph mining
techniques. These GAD tools, however, expose a new attacking surface,
ironically due to their unique advantage of being able to exploit the relations
among data. That is, attackers now can manipulate those relations (i.e., the
structure of the graph) to allow some target nodes to evade detection. In this
paper, we exploit this vulnerability by designing a new type of targeted
structural poisoning attacks to a representative regression-based GAD system
termed OddBall. Specially, we formulate the attack against OddBall as a
bi-level optimization problem, where the key technical challenge is to
efficiently solve the problem in a discrete domain. We propose a novel attack
method termed BinarizedAttack based on gradient descent. Comparing to prior
arts, BinarizedAttack can better use the gradient information, making it
particularly suitable for solving combinatorial optimization problems.
Furthermore, we investigate the attack transferability of BinarizedAttack by
employing it to attack other representation-learning-based GAD systems. Our
comprehensive experiments demonstrate that BinarizedAttack is very effective in
enabling target nodes to evade graph-based anomaly detection tools with limited
attackers&#x27; budget, and in the black-box transfer attack setting,
BinarizedAttack is also tested effective and in particular, can significantly
change the node embeddings learned by the GAD systems. Our research thus opens
the door to studying a new type of attack against security analytic tools that
rely on graph data.</span>

                    <span>In this paper we propose to study generalization of neural networks on small
algorithmically generated datasets. In this setting, questions about data
efficiency, memorization, generalization, and speed of learning can be studied
in great detail. In some situations we show that neural networks learn through
a process of &quot;grokking&quot; a pattern in the data, improving generalization
performance from random chance level to perfect generalization, and that this
improvement in generalization can happen well past the point of overfitting. We
also study generalization as a function of dataset size and find that smaller
datasets require increasing amounts of optimization for generalization. We
argue that these datasets provide a fertile ground for studying a poorly
understood aspect of deep learning: generalization of overparametrized neural
networks beyond memorization of the finite training dataset.</span>

                    <span>We consider the joint design and control of discrete-time stochastic
dynamical systems over a finite time horizon. We formulate the problem as a
multi-step optimization problem under uncertainty seeking to identify a system
design and a control policy that jointly maximize the expected sum of rewards
collected over the time horizon considered. The transition function, the reward
function and the policy are all parametrized, assumed known and differentiable
with respect to their parameters. We then introduce a deep reinforcement
learning algorithm combining policy gradient methods with model-based
optimization techniques to solve this problem. In essence, our algorithm
iteratively approximates the gradient of the expected return via Monte-Carlo
sampling and automatic differentiation and takes projected gradient ascent
steps in the space of environment and policy parameters. This algorithm is
referred to as Direct Environment and Policy Search (DEPS). We assess the
performance of our algorithm in three environments concerned with the design
and control of a mass-spring-damper system, a small-scale off-grid power system
and a drone, respectively. In addition, our algorithm is benchmarked against a
state-of-the-art deep reinforcement learning algorithm used to tackle joint
design and control problems. We show that DEPS performs at least as well or
better in all three environments, consistently yielding solutions with higher
returns in fewer iterations. Finally, solutions produced by our algorithm are
also compared with solutions produced by an algorithm that does not jointly
optimize environment and policy parameters, highlighting the fact that higher
returns can be achieved when joint optimization is performed.</span>

                    <span>This work studies the question of Representation Learning in RL: how can we
learn a compact low-dimensional representation such that on top of the
representation we can perform RL procedures such as exploration and
exploitation, in a sample efficient manner. We focus on the low-rank Markov
Decision Processes (MDPs) where the transition dynamics correspond to a
low-rank transition matrix. Unlike prior works that assume the representation
is known (e.g., linear MDPs), here we need to learn the representation for the
low-rank MDP. We study both the online RL and offline RL settings. For the
online setting, operating with the same computational oracles used in FLAMBE
(Agarwal et.al), the state-of-art algorithm for learning representations in
low-rank MDPs, we propose an algorithm REP-UCB Upper Confidence Bound driven
Representation learning for RL), which significantly improves the sample
complexity from $\widetilde{O}( A^9 d^7 / (\epsilon^{10} (1-\gamma)^{22}))$ for
FLAMBE to $\widetilde{O}( A^2 d^4 / (\epsilon^2 (1-\gamma)^{5}) )$ with $d$
being the rank of the transition matrix (or dimension of the ground truth
representation), $A$ being the number of actions, and $\gamma$ being the
discounted factor. Notably, REP-UCB is simpler than FLAMBE, as it directly
balances the interplay between representation learning, exploration, and
exploitation, while FLAMBE is an explore-then-commit style approach and has to
perform reward-free exploration step-by-step forward in time. For the offline
RL setting, we develop an algorithm that leverages pessimism to learn under a
partial coverage condition: our algorithm is able to compete against any policy
as long as it is covered by the offline distribution.</span>

                    <span>Online Tensor Factorization (OTF) is a fundamental tool in learning
low-dimensional interpretable features from streaming multi-modal data. While
various algorithmic and theoretical aspects of OTF have been investigated
recently, a general convergence guarantee to stationary points of the objective
function without any incoherence or sparsity assumptions is still lacking even
for the i.i.d. case. In this work, we introduce a novel algorithm that learns a
CANDECOMP/PARAFAC (CP) basis from a given stream of tensor-valued data under
general constraints, including nonnegativity constraints that induce
interpretability of the learned CP basis. We prove that our algorithm converges
almost surely to the set of stationary points of the objective function under
the hypothesis that the sequence of data tensors is generated by an underlying
Markov chain. Our setting covers the classical i.i.d. case as well as a wide
range of application contexts including data streams generated by independent
or MCMC sampling. Our result closes a gap between OTF and Online Matrix
Factorization in global convergence analysis \commHL{for CP-decompositions}.
Experimentally, we show that our algorithm converges much faster than standard
algorithms for nonnegative tensor factorization tasks on both synthetic and
real-world data. Also, we demonstrate the utility of our algorithm on a diverse
set of examples from an image, video, and time-series data, illustrating how
one may learn qualitatively different CP-dictionaries from the same tensor data
by exploiting the tensor structure in multiple ways.</span>

                    <span>We derive conditions for the existence of fixed points of nonnegative neural
networks, an important research objective to understand the behavior of neural
networks in modern applications involving autoencoders and loop unrolling
techniques, among others. In particular, we show that neural networks with
nonnegative inputs and nonnegative parameters can be recognized as monotonic
and (weakly) scalable functions within the framework of nonlinear
Perron-Frobenius theory. This fact enables us to derive conditions for the
existence of a nonempty fixed point set of the nonnegative neural networks, and
these conditions are weaker than those obtained recently using arguments in
convex analysis, which are typically based on the assumption of nonexpansivity
of the activation functions. Furthermore, we prove that the shape of the fixed
point set of monotonic and weakly scalable neural networks is often an
interval, which degenerates to a point for the case of scalable networks. The
chief results of this paper are verified in numerical simulations, where we
consider an autoencoder-type network that first compresses angular power
spectra in massive MIMO systems, and, second, reconstruct the input spectra
from the compressed signals.</span>

                    <span>We consider applications involving a large set of instances of projecting
points to polytopes. We develop an intuition guided by theoretical and
empirical analysis to show that when these instances follow certain structures,
a large majority of the projections lie on vertices of the polytopes. To do
these projections efficiently we derive a vertex-oriented incremental algorithm
to project a point onto any arbitrary polytope, as well as give specific
algorithms to cater to simplex projection and polytopes where the unit box is
cut by planes. Such settings are especially useful in web-scale applications
such as optimal matching or allocation problems. Several such problems in
internet marketplaces (e-commerce, ride-sharing, food delivery, professional
services, advertising, etc.), can be formulated as Linear Programs (LP) with
such polytope constraints that require a projection step in the overall
optimization process. We show that in the very recent work, the polytopic
projection is the most expensive step and our efficient projection algorithms
help in gaining massive improvements in performance.</span>

                    <span>The great performance of machine learning algorithms and deep neural networks
in several perception and control tasks is pushing the industry to adopt such
technologies in safety-critical applications, as autonomous robots and
self-driving vehicles. At present, however, several issues need to be solved to
make deep learning methods more trustworthy, predictable, safe, and secure
against adversarial attacks. Although several methods have been proposed to
improve the trustworthiness of deep neural networks, most of them are tailored
for specific classes of adversarial examples, hence failing to detect other
corner cases or unsafe inputs that heavily deviate from the training samples.
This paper presents a lightweight monitoring architecture based on coverage
paradigms to enhance the model robustness against different unsafe inputs. In
particular, four coverage analysis methods are proposed and tested in the
architecture for evaluating multiple detection logics. Experimental results
show that the proposed approach is effective in detecting both powerful
adversarial examples and out-of-distribution inputs, introducing limited
extra-execution time and memory requirements.</span>

                    <span>We study the transfer learning process between two linear regression
problems. An important and timely special case is when the regressors are
overparameterized and perfectly interpolate their training data. We examine a
parameter transfer mechanism whereby a subset of the parameters of the target
task solution are constrained to the values learned for a related source task.
We analytically characterize the generalization error of the target task in
terms of the salient factors in the transfer learning architecture, i.e., the
number of examples available, the number of (free) parameters in each of the
tasks, the number of parameters transferred from the source to target task, and
the relation between the two tasks. Our non-asymptotic analysis shows that the
generalization error of the target task follows a two-dimensional double
descent trend (with respect to the number of free parameters in each of the
tasks) that is controlled by the transfer learning factors. Our analysis points
to specific cases where the transfer of parameters is beneficial as a
substitute for extra overparameterization (i.e., additional free parameters in
the target task). Specifically, we show that the usefulness of a transfer
learning setting is fragile and depends on a delicate interplay among the set
of transferred parameters, the relation between the tasks, and the true
solution. We also demonstrate that overparameterized transfer learning is not
necessarily more beneficial when the source task is closer or identical to the
target task.</span>

                    <span>Data privacy has become an increasingly important issue in Machine Learning
(ML), where many approaches have been developed to tackle this challenge, e.g.
cryptography (Homomorphic Encryption (HE), Differential Privacy (DP), etc.) and
collaborative training (Secure Multi-Party Computation (MPC), Distributed
Learning and Federated Learning (FL)). These techniques have a particular focus
on data encryption or secure local computation. They transfer the intermediate
information to the third party to compute the final result. Gradient exchanging
is commonly considered to be a secure way of training a robust model
collaboratively in Deep Learning (DL). However, recent researches have
demonstrated that sensitive information can be recovered from the shared
gradient. Generative Adversarial Network (GAN), in particular, has shown to be
effective in recovering such information. However, GAN based techniques require
additional information, such as class labels which are generally unavailable
for privacy-preserved learning. In this paper, we show that, in the FL system,
image-based privacy data can be easily recovered in full from the shared
gradient only via our proposed Generative Regression Neural Network (GRNN). We
formulate the attack to be a regression problem and optimize two branches of
the generative model by minimizing the distance between gradients. We evaluate
our method on several image classification tasks. The results illustrate that
our proposed GRNN outperforms state-of-the-art methods with better stability,
stronger robustness, and higher accuracy. It also has no convergence
requirement to the global FL model. Moreover, we demonstrate information
leakage using face re-identification. Some defense strategies are also
discussed in this work.</span>

                    <span>Active inference is a unifying theory for perception and action resting upon
the idea that the brain maintains an internal model of the world by minimizing
free energy. From a behavioral perspective, active inference agents can be seen
as self-evidencing beings that act to fulfill their optimistic predictions,
namely preferred outcomes or goals. In contrast, reinforcement learning
requires human-designed rewards to accomplish any desired outcome. Although
active inference could provide a more natural self-supervised objective for
control, its applicability has been limited because of the shortcomings in
scaling the approach to complex environments. In this work, we propose a
contrastive objective for active inference that strongly reduces the
computational burden in learning the agent&#x27;s generative model and planning
future actions. Our method performs notably better than likelihood-based active
inference in image-based tasks, while also being computationally cheaper and
easier to train. We compare to reinforcement learning agents that have access
to human-designed reward functions, showing that our approach closely matches
their performance. Finally, we also show that contrastive methods perform
significantly better in the case of distractors in the environment and that our
method is able to generalize goals to variations in the background.</span>

                    <span>Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) can be viewed as nonlinear sieves that can
approximate complex functions of high dimensional variables more effectively
than linear sieves. We investigate the computational performance of various
ANNs in nonparametric instrumental variables (NPIV) models of moderately high
dimensional covariates that are relevant to empirical economics. We present two
efficient procedures for estimation and inference on a weighted average
derivative (WAD): an orthogonalized plug-in with optimally-weighted sieve
minimum distance (OP-OSMD) procedure and a sieve efficient score (ES)
procedure. Both estimators for WAD use ANN sieves to approximate the unknown
NPIV function and are root-n asymptotically normal and first-order equivalent.
We provide a detailed practitioner&#x27;s recipe for implementing both efficient
procedures. This involves the choice of tuning parameters for the unknown NPIV,
the conditional expectations and the optimal weighting function that are
present in both procedures but also the choice of tuning parameters for the
unknown Riesz representer in the ES procedure. We compare their finite-sample
performances in various simulation designs that involve smooth NPIV function of
up to 13 continuous covariates, different nonlinearities and covariate
correlations. Some Monte Carlo findings include: 1) tuning and optimization are
more delicate in ANN estimation; 2) given proper tuning, both ANN estimators
with various architectures can perform well; 3) easier to tune ANN OP-OSMD
estimators than ANN ES estimators; 4) stable inferences are more difficult to
achieve with ANN (than spline) estimators; 5) there are gaps between current
implementations and approximation theories. Finally, we apply ANN NPIV to
estimate average partial derivatives in two empirical demand examples with
multivariate covariates.</span>

                    <span>Evaluating the real-world performance of network protocols is challenging.
Randomized control trials (RCT) are expensive and inaccessible to most
researchers, while expert-designed simulators fail to capture complex behaviors
in real networks. We present CausalSim, a data-driven simulator for network
protocols that addresses this challenge. Learning network behavior from
observational data is complicated due to the bias introduced by the protocols
used during data collection. CausalSim uses traces from an initial RCT under a
set of protocols to learn a causal network model, effectively removing the
biases present in the data. Using this model, CausalSim can then simulate any
protocol over the same traces (i.e., for counterfactual predictions). Key to
CausalSim is the novel use of adversarial neural network training that exploits

                    <span>We study reward design strategies for incentivizing a reinforcement learning
agent to adopt a policy from a set of admissible policies. The goal of the
reward designer is to modify the underlying reward function cost-efficiently
while ensuring that any approximately optimal deterministic policy under the
new reward function is admissible and performs well under the original reward
function. This problem can be viewed as a dual to the problem of optimal reward
poisoning attacks: instead of forcing an agent to adopt a specific policy, the
reward designer incentivizes an agent to avoid taking actions that are
inadmissible in certain states. Perhaps surprisingly, and in contrast to the
problem of optimal reward poisoning attacks, we first show that the reward
design problem for admissible policy teaching is computationally challenging,
and it is NP-hard to find an approximately optimal reward modification. We then
proceed by formulating a surrogate problem whose optimal solution approximates
the optimal solution to the reward design problem in our setting, but is more
amenable to optimization techniques and analysis. For this surrogate problem,
we present characterization results that provide bounds on the value of the
optimal solution. Finally, we design a local search algorithm to solve the
surrogate problem and showcase its utility using simulation-based experiments.</span>

                    <span>Multiple methods of finding the vertices belonging to a planted dense
subgraph in a random dense $G(n, p)$ graph have been proposed, with an emphasis
on planted cliques. Such methods can identify the planted subgraph in
polynomial time, but are all limited to several subgraph structures. Here, we
present PYGON, a graph neural network-based algorithm, which is insensitive to
the structure of the planted subgraph. This is the first algorithm that uses
advanced learning tools for recovering dense subgraphs. We show that PYGON can
recover cliques of sizes $\Theta\left(\sqrt{n}\right)$, where $n$ is the size
of the background graph, comparable with the state of the art. We also show
that the same algorithm can recover multiple other planted subgraphs of size
$\Theta\left(\sqrt{n}\right)$, in both directed and undirected graphs. We
suggest a conjecture that no polynomial time PAC-learning algorithm can detect
planted dense subgraphs with size smaller than $O\left(\sqrt{n}\right)$, even
if in principle one could find dense subgraphs of logarithmic size.</span>

                    <span>Double-strand DNA breaks (DSBs) are a form of DNA damage that can cause
abnormal chromosomal rearrangements. Recent technologies based on
high-throughput experiments have obvious high costs and technical
challenges.Therefore, we design a graph neural network based method to predict
DSBs (GraphDSB), using DNA sequence features and chromosome structure
information. In order to improve the expression ability of the model, we
introduce Jumping Knowledge architecture and several effective structural
encoding methods. The contribution of structural information to the prediction
of DSBs is verified by the experiments on datasets from normal human epidermal
keratinocytes (NHEK) and chronic myeloid leukemia cell line (K562), and the
ablation studies further demonstrate the effectiveness of the designed

analyze the contribution of node features and topology to DSBs prediction, and
proved the high contribution of 5-mer DNA sequence features and two chromatin

                    <span>Analyzing numerous or long time series is difficult in practice due to the
high storage costs and computational requirements. Therefore, techniques have
been proposed to generate compact similarity-preserving representations of time
series, enabling real-time similarity search on large in-memory data
collections. However, the existing techniques are not ideally suited for
assessing similarity when sequences are locally out of phase. In this paper, we
propose the use of product quantization for efficient similarity-based
comparison of time series under time warping. The idea is to first compress the
data by partitioning the time series into equal length sub-sequences which are
represented by a short code. The distance between two time series can then be
efficiently approximated by pre-computed elastic distances between their codes.
The partitioning into sub-sequences forces unwanted alignments, which we
address with a pre-alignment step using the maximal overlap discrete wavelet
transform (MODWT). To demonstrate the efficiency and accuracy of our method, we
perform an extensive experimental evaluation on benchmark datasets in nearest
neighbors classification and clustering applications. Overall, the proposed
solution emerges as a highly efficient (both in terms of memory usage and
computation time) replacement for elastic measures in time series applications.</span>

                    <span>The explicit low-rank regularization, e.g., nuclear norm regularization, has
been widely used in imaging sciences. However, it has been found that implicit
regularization outperforms explicit ones in various image processing tasks.
Another issue is that the fixed explicit regularization limits the
applicability to broad kinds of images since different images favor different
features captured by using different explicit regularizations. As such, this
paper proposes a new adaptive and implicit low-rank regularization that
captures the low-rank prior dynamically from the training data. At the core of
our new adaptive and implicit low-rank regularization is parameterizing the
Laplacian matrix in the Dirichlet energy-based regularization with a neural
network, and we call the proposed model \textit{AIR-Net}. Theoretically, we
show that the adaptive regularization of AIR-Net enhances the implicit
regularization and vanishes at the end of training. We validate AIR-Net&#x27;s
effectiveness on various benchmark tasks, indicating that the AIR-Net is
particularly favorable for the scenarios when the missing entries are
non-uniform. The code can be found at

                    <span>Counterfactual examples for an input -- perturbations that change specific
features but not others -- have been shown to be useful for evaluating bias of
machine learning models, e.g., against specific demographic groups. However,
generating counterfactual examples for images is non-trivial due to the
underlying causal structure on the various features of an image. To be
meaningful, generated perturbations need to satisfy constraints implied by the
causal model. We present a method for generating counterfactuals by
incorporating a structural causal model (SCM) in an improved variant of
Adversarially Learned Inference (ALI), that generates counterfactuals in
accordance with the causal relationships between attributes of an image. Based
on the generated counterfactuals, we show how to explain a pre-trained machine
learning classifier, evaluate its bias, and mitigate the bias using a
counterfactual regularizer. On the Morpho-MNIST dataset, our method generates
counterfactuals comparable in quality to prior work on SCM-based
counterfactuals (DeepSCM), while on the more complex CelebA dataset our method
outperforms DeepSCM in generating high-quality valid counterfactuals. Moreover,
generated counterfactuals are indistinguishable from reconstructed images in a
human evaluation experiment and we subsequently use them to evaluate the
fairness of a standard classifier trained on CelebA data. We show that the
classifier is biased w.r.t. skin and hair color, and how counterfactual
regularization can remove those biases.</span>

                    <span>Social media has become an effective platform to generate and spread fake
news that can mislead people and even distort public opinion. Centralized
methods for fake news detection, however, cannot effectively protect user
privacy during the process of centralized data collection for training models.
Moreover, it cannot fully involve user feedback in the loop of learning
detection models for further enhancing fake news detection. To overcome these
challenges, this paper proposed a novel decentralized method, Human-in-the-loop
Based Swarm Learning (HBSL), to integrate user feedback into the loop of
learning and inference for recognizing fake news without violating user privacy
in a decentralized manner. It consists of distributed nodes that are able to
independently learn and detect fake news on local data. Furthermore, detection
models trained on these nodes can be enhanced through decentralized model
merging. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms
the state-of-the-art decentralized method in regard of detecting fake news on a
benchmark dataset.</span>

models (TagRec, MTPR, and CRGAN) learn to generate personalized and
fake-but-realistic rankings of preferences for top-N recommendations by using
previous interactions. This work successfully replicates the results published
in the original paper and discusses the impact of certain differences between
the CFGAN framework and the model used in the original evaluation. The absence
of random noise and the use of real user profiles as condition vectors leaves
the generator prone to learn a degenerate solution in which the output vector
is identical to the input vector, therefore, behaving essentially as a simple
autoencoder. The work further expands the experimental analysis comparing CFGAN
against a selection of simple and well-known properly optimized baselines,
observing that CFGAN is not consistently competitive against them despite its
high computational cost. To ensure the reproducibility of these analyses, this

                    <span>Pre-trained language models (LMs) often struggle to reason logically or
generalize in a compositional fashion. Recent work suggests that incorporating
external entity knowledge can improve LMs&#x27; abilities to reason and generalize.
However, the effect of explicitly providing entity abstraction remains unclear,
especially with recent studies suggesting that pre-trained LMs already encode
some of that knowledge in their parameters. We study the utility of
incorporating entity type abstractions into pre-trained Transformers and test
these methods on four NLP tasks requiring different forms of logical reasoning:
(1) compositional language understanding with text-based relational reasoning
(CLUTRR), (2) abductive reasoning (ProofWriter), (3) multi-hop question
answering (HotpotQA), and (4) conversational question answering (CoQA). We
propose and empirically explore three ways to add such abstraction: (i) as
additional input embeddings, (ii) as a separate sequence to encode, and (iii)
as an auxiliary prediction task for the model. Overall, our analysis
demonstrates that models with abstract entity knowledge performs better than
without it. However, our experiments also show that the benefits strongly
depend on the technique used and the task at hand. The best abstraction aware
models achieved an overall accuracy of 88.8% and 91.8% compared to the baseline
model achieving 62.3% and 89.8% on CLUTRR and ProofWriter respectively. In
addition, abstraction-aware models showed improved compositional generalization
in both interpolation and extrapolation settings. However, for HotpotQA and
CoQA, we find that F1 scores improve by only 0.5% on average. Our results
suggest that the benefit of explicit abstraction is significant in formally
defined logical reasoning settings requiring many reasoning hops, but point to
the notion that it is less beneficial for NLP tasks having less formal logical
structure.</span>

                    <span>Chemistry research has both high material and computational costs to conduct
experiments. Institutions thus consider chemical data to be valuable and there
have been few efforts to construct large public datasets for machine learning.
Another challenge is that different intuitions are interested in different
classes of molecules, creating heterogeneous data that cannot be easily joined
by conventional distributed training. In this work, we introduce federated
heterogeneous molecular learning to address these challenges. Federated
learning allows end-users to build a global model collaboratively while keeping
the training data distributed over isolated clients. Due to the lack of related
research, we first simulate a heterogeneous federated learning benchmark
(FedChem) by jointly performing scaffold splitting and latent Dirichlet
allocation on existing datasets for heterogeneously distributed client data.
Our results on FedChem show that significant learning challenges arise when
working with heterogeneous molecules across clients. We then propose a method
to alleviate the problem, namely Federated Learning by Instance reweighTing
(FLIT(+)). FLIT(+) can align the local training across heterogeneous clients by
improving the performance for uncertain samples. Comprehensive experiments
conducted on our new benchmark FedChem validate the advantages of this method
over other federated learning schemes. FedChem should enable a new type of
collaboration for improving AI in chemistry that mitigates concerns about
valuable chemical data.</span>

                    <span>Annotating musical beats is a very long in tedious process. In order to
combat this problem, we present a new self-supervised learning pretext task for
beat tracking and downbeat estimation. This task makes use of Spleeter, an
audio source separation model, to separate a song&#x27;s drums from the rest of its
signal. The first set of signals are used as positives, and by extension
negatives, for contrastive learning pre-training. The drum-less signals, on the
other hand, are used as anchors. When pre-training a fully-convolutional and
recurrent model using this pretext task, an onset function is learned. In some
cases, this function was found to be mapped to periodic elements in a song. We
found that pre-trained models outperformed randomly initialized models when a
beat tracking training set was extremely small (less than 10 examples). When
that was not the case, pre-training led to a learning speed-up that caused the
model to overfit to the training set. More generally, this work defines new
perspectives in the realm of musical self-supervised learning. It is notably
one of the first works to use audio source separation as a fundamental
component of self-supervision.</span>

                    <span>Convolutional neural networks have gained vast popularity due to their
excellent performance in the fields of computer vision, image processing, and
others. Unfortunately, it is now well known that convolutional networks often
produce erroneous results - for example, minor perturbations of the inputs of
these networks can result in severe classification errors. Numerous
verification approaches have been proposed in recent years to prove the absence
of such errors, but these are typically geared for fully connected networks and
suffer from exacerbated scalability issues when applied to convolutional
networks. To address this gap, we present here the Cnn-Abs framework, which is
particularly aimed at the verification of convolutional networks. The core of
Cnn-Abs is an abstraction-refinement technique, which simplifies the
verification problem through the removal of convolutional connections in a way
that soundly creates an over-approximation of the original problem; and which
restores these connections if the resulting problem becomes too abstract.
Cnn-Abs is designed to use existing verification engines as a backend, and our
evaluation demonstrates that it can significantly boost the performance of a
state-of-the-art DNN verification engine, reducing runtime by 15.7% on average.</span>

vitamins and nutrients. In our research, a Deep learning method has been used
that can automatically identify spinach and this method has a dataset of a
total of five species of spinach that contains 3785 images. Four Convolutional
Neural Network (CNN) models were used to classify our spinach. These models
give more accurate results for image classification. Before applying these
models there is some preprocessing of the image data. For the preprocessing of
data, some methods need to happen. Those are RGB conversion, filtering, resize
&amp; rescaling, and categorization. After applying these methods image data are
pre-processed and ready to be used in the classifier algorithms. The accuracy
of these classifiers is in between 98.68% - 99.79%. Among those models, VGG16
achieved the highest accuracy of 99.79%.</span>

                    <span>Local explainability methods -- those which seek to generate an explanation
for each prediction -- are becoming increasingly prevalent due to the need for
practitioners to rationalize their model outputs. However, comparing local
explainability methods is difficult since they each generate outputs in various
scales and dimensions. Furthermore, due to the stochastic nature of some
explainability methods, it is possible for different runs of a method to
produce contradictory explanations for a given observation. In this paper, we
propose a topology-based framework to extract a simplified representation from
a set of local explanations. We do so by first modeling the relationship
between the explanation space and the model predictions as a scalar function.
Then, we compute the topological skeleton of this function. This topological
skeleton acts as a signature for such functions, which we use to compare
different explanation methods. We demonstrate that our framework can not only
reliably identify differences between explainability techniques but also
provides stable representations. Then, we show how our framework can be used to
identify appropriate parameters for local explainability methods. Our framework
is simple, does not require complex optimizations, and can be broadly applied
to most local explanation methods. We believe the practicality and versatility
of our approach will help promote topology-based approaches as a tool for
understanding and comparing explanation methods.</span>

                    <span>Deep learning is one of the most successful and far-reaching strategies used
in machine learning today. However, the scale and utility of neural networks is
still greatly limited by the current hardware used to train them. These
concerns have become increasingly pressing as conventional computers quickly
approach physical limitations that will slow performance improvements in years
to come. For these reasons, scientists have begun to explore alternative
computing platforms, like quantum computers, for training neural networks. In
recent years, variational quantum circuits have emerged as one of the most
successful approaches to quantum deep learning on noisy intermediate scale
quantum devices. We propose a hybrid quantum-classical neural network
architecture where each neuron is a variational quantum circuit. We empirically
analyze the performance of this hybrid neural network on a series of binary
classification data sets using a simulated universal quantum computer and a
state of the art universal quantum computer. On simulated hardware, we observe
that the hybrid neural network achieves roughly 10% higher classification
accuracy and 20% better minimization of cost than an individual variational
quantum circuit. On quantum hardware, we observe that each model only performs
well when the qubit and gate count is sufficiently small.</span>

                    <span>Continual learning in environments with shifting data distributions is a
challenging problem with several real-world applications. In this paper we
consider settings in which the data distribution(task) shifts abruptly and the
timing of these shifts are not known. Furthermore, we consider a
semi-supervised task-agnostic setting in which the learning algorithm has
access to both task-segmented and unsegmented data for offline training. We
propose a novel approach called mixture of Basismodels (MoB) for addressing
this problem setting. The core idea is to learn a small set of basis models and
to construct a dynamic, task-dependent mixture of the models to predict for the
current task. We also propose a new methodology to detect observations that are
out-of-distribution with respect to the existing basis models and to
instantiate new models as needed. We test our approach in multiple domains and
show that it attains better prediction error than existing methods in most
cases while using fewer models than other multiple model approaches. Moreover,
we analyze the latent task representations learned by MoB and show that similar
tasks tend to cluster in the latent space and that the latent representation
shifts at the task boundaries when tasks are dissimilar.</span>

                    <span>Fuzzy Cognitive Maps (FCMs) have emerged as an interpretable signed weighted
digraph method consisting of nodes (concepts) and weights which represent the
dependencies among the concepts. Although FCMs have attained considerable
achievements in various time series prediction applications, designing an FCM
model with time-efficient training method is still an open challenge. Thus,
this paper introduces a novel univariate time series forecasting technique,
which is composed of a group of randomized high order FCM models labeled
R-HFCM. The novelty of the proposed R-HFCM model is relevant to merging the
concepts of FCM and Echo State Network (ESN) as an efficient and particular
family of Reservoir Computing (RC) models, where the least squares algorithm is
applied to train the model. From another perspective, the structure of R-HFCM
consists of the input layer, reservoir layer, and output layer in which only
the output layer is trainable while the weights of each sub-reservoir
components are selected randomly and keep constant during the training process.
As case studies, this model considers solar energy forecasting with public data
for Brazilian solar stations as well as Malaysia dataset, which includes hourly
electric load and temperature data of the power supply company of the city of
Johor in Malaysia. The experiment also includes the effect of the map size,
activation function, the presence of bias and the size of the reservoir on the
accuracy of R-HFCM method. The obtained results confirm the outperformance of
the proposed R-HFCM model in comparison to the other methods. This study
provides evidence that FCM can be a new way to implement a reservoir of
dynamics in time series modelling.</span>

                    <span>Geosteering of wells requires fast interpretation of geophysical logs which
is a non-unique inverse problem. Current work presents a proof-of-concept
approach to multi-modal probabilistic inversion of logs using a single
evaluation of an artificial deep neural network (DNN). A mixture density DNN
(MDN) is trained using the &quot;multiple-trajectory-prediction&quot; (MTP) loss
functions, which avoids mode collapse typical for traditional MDNs, and allows
multi-modal prediction ahead of data. The proposed approach is verified on the
real-time stratigraphic inversion of gamma-ray logs. The multi-modal predictor
outputs several likely inverse solutions/predictions, providing more accurate
and realistic solutions compared to a deterministic regression using a DNN. For
these likely stratigraphic curves, the model simultaneously predicts their
probabilities, which are implicitly learned from the training geological data.
The stratigraphy predictions and their probabilities obtained in milliseconds
from the MDN can enable better real-time decisions under geological
uncertainties.</span>

fine-grained basis, by modifying system APIs to make it possible to make
informed trade offs between performance and carbon emissions, and by raising

clustering algorithms in grouping similar objects into clusters. This paper
introduces a new similarity measure called point-set kernel which computes the
similarity between an object and a set of objects. The proposed clustering
procedure utilizes this new measure to characterize every cluster grown from a
seed object. We show that the new clustering procedure is both effective and
efficient that enables it to deal with large scale datasets. In contrast,
existing clustering algorithms are either efficient or effective. In comparison
with the state-of-the-art density-peak clustering and scalable kernel k-means

orders of magnitude faster when applying to datasets of millions of data

displaced control points. We leverage the power of neural networks to inject
the underlying shape geometry into the deformation parameters. The goal of our
technique is to enable a realistic and intuitive shape deformation. Our method
is built upon moving least-squares (MLS), since it minimizes a weighted sum of
the given control point displacements. Traditionally, the influence of each
control point on every point in space (i.e., the weighting function) is defined
using inverse distance heuristics. In this work, we opt to learn the weighting
function, by training a neural network on the control points from a single
input shape, and exploit the innate smoothness of neural networks. Our
geometry-aware control point deformation is agnostic to the surface
representation and quality; it can be applied to point clouds or meshes,
including non-manifold and disconnected surface soups. We show that our
technique facilitates intuitive piecewise smooth deformations, which are well
suited for manufactured objects. We show the advantages of our approach

                    <span>Controlling antenna tilts in cellular networks is imperative to reach an
efficient trade-off between network coverage and capacity. In this paper, we
devise algorithms learning optimal tilt control policies from existing data (in
the so-called passive learning setting) or from data actively generated by the
algorithms (the active learning setting). We formalize the design of such
algorithms as a Best Policy Identification (BPI) problem in Contextual Linear
Multi-Arm Bandits (CL-MAB). An arm represents an antenna tilt update; the
context captures current network conditions; the reward corresponds to an
improvement of performance, mixing coverage and capacity; and the objective is
to identify, with a given level of confidence, an approximately optimal policy
(a function mapping the context to an arm with maximal reward). For CL-MAB in
both active and passive learning settings, we derive information-theoretical
lower bounds on the number of samples required by any algorithm returning an
approximately optimal policy with a given level of certainty, and devise
algorithms achieving these fundamental limits. We apply our algorithms to the
Remote Electrical Tilt (RET) optimization problem in cellular networks, and
show that they can produce optimal tilt update policy using much fewer data
samples than naive or existing rule-based learning algorithms.</span>

                    <span>Financial forecasting has been an important and active area of machine
learning research because of the challenges it presents and the potential
rewards that even minor improvements in prediction accuracy or forecasting may
entail. Traditionally, financial forecasting has heavily relied on quantitative
indicators and metrics derived from structured financial statements. Earnings
conference call data, including text and audio, is an important source of
unstructured data that has been used for various prediction tasks using deep
earning and related approaches. However, current deep learning-based methods
are limited in the way that they deal with numeric data; numbers are typically
treated as plain-text tokens without taking advantage of their underlying
numeric structure. This paper describes a numeric-oriented hierarchical
transformer model to predict stock returns, and financial risk using
multi-modal aligned earnings calls data by taking advantage of the different
categories of numbers (monetary, temporal, percentages etc.) and their
magnitude. We present the results of a comprehensive evaluation of NumHTML
against several state-of-the-art baselines using a real-world publicly
available dataset. The results indicate that NumHTML significantly outperforms
the current state-of-the-art across a variety of evaluation metrics and that it
has the potential to offer significant financial gains in a practical trading

                    <span>Robotic manipulation of cloth remains challenging for robotics due to the
complex dynamics of the cloth, lack of a low-dimensional state representation,
and self-occlusions. In contrast to previous model-based approaches that learn
a pixel-based dynamics model or a compressed latent vector dynamics, we propose
to learn a particle-based dynamics model from a partial point cloud
observation. To overcome the challenges of partial observability, we infer
which visible points are connected on the underlying cloth mesh. We then learn
a dynamics model over this visible connectivity graph. Compared to previous
learning-based approaches, our model poses strong inductive bias with its
particle based representation for learning the underlying cloth physics; it is
invariant to visual features; and the predictions can be more easily
visualized. We show that our method greatly outperforms previous
state-of-the-art model-based and model-free reinforcement learning methods in
simulation. Furthermore, we demonstrate zero-shot sim-to-real transfer where we
deploy the model trained in simulation on a Franka arm and show that the model
can successfully smooth different types of cloth from crumpled configurations.

                    <span>Data-driven models created by machine learning gain in importance in all
fields of design and engineering. They have high potential to assists
decision-makers in creating novel artefacts with a better performance and
sustainability. However, limited generalization and the black-box nature of
these models induce limited explainability and reusability. These drawbacks
provide significant barriers retarding adoption in engineering design. To
overcome this situation, we propose a component-based approach to create
partial component models by machine learning (ML). This component-based
approach aligns deep learning to systems engineering (SE). By means of the
example of energy efficient building design, we first demonstrate
generalization of the component-based method by accurately predicting the
performance of designs with random structure different from training data.
Second, we illustrate explainability by local sampling, sensitivity information
and rules derived from low-depth decision trees and by evaluating this
information from an engineering design perspective. The key for explainability
is that activations at interfaces between the components are interpretable
engineering quantities. In this way, the hierarchical component system forms a
deep neural network (DNN) that directly integrates information for engineering
explainability. The large range of possible configurations in composing
components allows the examination of novel unseen design cases with
understandable data-driven models. The matching of parameter ranges of
components by similar probability distribution produces reusable,
well-generalizing, and trustworthy models. The approach adapts the model
structure to engineering methods of systems engineering and domain knowledge.</span>

                    <span>We suggest a simple practical method to combine the human and artificial
intelligence to both learn best investment practices of fund managers, and
provide recommendations to improve them. Our approach is based on a combination
of Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL) and RL. First, the IRL component learns
the intent of fund managers as suggested by their trading history, and recovers
their implied reward function. At the second step, this reward function is used
by a direct RL algorithm to optimize asset allocation decisions. We show that
our method is able to improve over the performance of individual fund managers.</span>

                    <span>Machine learning (ML) has often been applied to space weather (SW) problems
in recent years. SW originates from solar perturbations and is comprised of the
resulting complex variations they cause within the systems between the Sun and
Earth. These systems are tightly coupled and not well understood. This creates
a need for skillful models with knowledge about the confidence of their
predictions. One example of such a dynamical system is the thermosphere, the
neutral region of Earth&#x27;s upper atmosphere. Our inability to forecast it has
severe repercussions in the context of satellite drag and collision avoidance
operations for objects in low Earth orbit. Even with (assumed) perfect driver
forecasts, our incomplete knowledge of the system results in often inaccurate
neutral mass density predictions. Continuing efforts are being made to improve
model accuracy, but density models rarely provide estimates of uncertainty. In
this work, we propose two techniques to develop nonlinear ML models to predict
thermospheric density while providing calibrated uncertainty estimates: Monte
Carlo (MC) dropout and direct prediction of the probability distribution, both
using the negative logarithm of predictive density (NLPD) loss function. We
show the performance for models trained on local and global datasets. This
shows that NLPD provides similar results for both techniques but the direct
probability method has a much lower computational cost. For the global model
regressed on the SET HASDM density database, we achieve errors of 11% on
independent test data with well-calibrated uncertainty estimates. Using an
in-situ CHAMP density dataset, both techniques provide test error on the order
of 13%. The CHAMP models (on independent data) are within 2% of perfect
calibration for all prediction intervals tested. This model can also be used to
obtain global predictions with uncertainties at a given epoch.</span>

                    <span>Acquiring information on large areas on the earth&#x27;s surface through satellite
cameras allows us to see much more than we can see while standing on the
ground. This assists us in detecting and monitoring the physical
characteristics of an area like land-use patterns, atmospheric conditions,
forest cover, and many unlisted aspects. The obtained images not only keep
track of continuous natural phenomena but are also crucial in tackling the
global challenge of severe deforestation. Among which Amazon basin accounts for
the largest share every year. Proper data analysis would help limit detrimental
effects on the ecosystem and biodiversity with a sustainable healthy
atmosphere. This report aims to label the satellite image chips of the Amazon
rainforest with atmospheric and various classes of land cover or land use
through different machine learning and superior deep learning models.
Evaluation is done based on the F2 metric, while for loss function, we have
both sigmoid cross-entropy as well as softmax cross-entropy. Images are fed
indirectly to the machine learning classifiers after only features are
extracted using pre-trained ImageNet architectures. Whereas for deep learning
models, ensembles of fine-tuned ImageNet pre-trained models are used via
transfer learning. Our best score was achieved so far with the F2 metric is

                    <span>Control certificates based on barrier functions have been a powerful tool to
generate probably safe control policies for dynamical systems. However,
existing methods based on barrier certificates are normally for white-box
systems with differentiable dynamics, which makes them inapplicable to many
practical applications where the system is a black-box and cannot be accurately
modeled. On the other side, model-free reinforcement learning (RL) methods for
black-box systems suffer from lack of safety guarantees and low sampling
efficiency. In this paper, we propose a novel method that can learn safe
control policies and barrier certificates for black-box dynamical systems,
without requiring for an accurate system model. Our method re-designs the loss
function to back-propagate gradient to the control policy even when the
black-box dynamical system is non-differentiable, and we show that the safety
certificates hold on the black-box system. Empirical results in simulation show
that our method can significantly improve the performance of the learned
policies by achieving nearly 100% safety and goal reaching rates using much
fewer training samples, compared to state-of-the-art black-box safe control
methods. Our learned agents can also generalize to unseen scenarios while
keeping the original performance. The source code can be found at

problems, and we see the framework has been applied to build relationship
between recording wavefield and velocity (Yang et al., 2016). Here we will
extend the work from 2 perspectives, one is deriving a more appropriate loss
function, as we now, pixel-2-pixel comparison might not be the best choice to
characterize image structure, and we will elaborate on how to construct cost
function to capture high level feature to enhance the model performance.
Another dimension is searching for the more appropriate neural architecture,
which is a subset of an even bigger picture, the automatic machine learning, or
AutoML. There are several famous networks, U-net, ResNet (He et al., 2016) and
DenseNet (Huang et al., 2017), and they achieve phenomenal results for certain
problems, yet it&#x27;s hard to argue they are the best for inversion problems
without thoroughly searching within certain space. Here we will be showing our

                    <span>We consider the problem of variance reduction in randomized controlled
trials, through the use of covariates correlated with the outcome but
independent of the treatment. We propose a machine learning regression-adjusted
treatment effect estimator, which we call MLRATE. MLRATE uses machine learning
predictors of the outcome to reduce estimator variance. It employs
cross-fitting to avoid overfitting biases, and we prove consistency and
asymptotic normality under general conditions. MLRATE is robust to poor
predictions from the machine learning step: if the predictions are uncorrelated
with the outcomes, the estimator performs asymptotically no worse than the
standard difference-in-means estimator, while if predictions are highly
correlated with outcomes, the efficiency gains are large. In A/A tests, for a
set of 48 outcome metrics commonly monitored in Facebook experiments the
estimator has over 70% lower variance than the simple difference-in-means
estimator, and about 19% lower variance than the common univariate procedure
which adjusts only for pre-experiment values of the outcome.</span>

clustering algorithms in grouping similar objects into clusters. This paper
introduces a new similarity measure called point-set kernel which computes the
similarity between an object and a set of objects. The proposed clustering
procedure utilizes this new measure to characterize every cluster grown from a
seed object. We show that the new clustering procedure is both effective and
efficient that enables it to deal with large scale datasets. In contrast,
existing clustering algorithms are either efficient or effective. In comparison
with the state-of-the-art density-peak clustering and scalable kernel k-means
clustering, we show that the proposed algorithm is more effective and runs
orders of magnitude faster when applying to datasets of millions of data
points, on a commonly used computing machine.</span>

                    <span>Spectral clustering has been one of the widely used methods for community
detection in networks. However, large-scale networks bring computational
challenges to the eigenvalue decomposition therein. In this paper, we study the
spectral clustering using randomized sketching algorithms from a statistical
perspective, where we typically assume the network data are generated from a
stochastic block model that is not necessarily of full rank. To do this, we
first use the recently developed sketching algorithms to obtain two randomized
spectral clustering algorithms, namely, the random projection-based and the
random sampling-based spectral clustering. Then we study the theoretical bounds
of the resulting algorithms in terms of the approximation error for the
population adjacency matrix, the misclassification error, and the estimation
error for the link probability matrix. It turns out that, under mild
conditions, the randomized spectral clustering algorithms lead to the same
theoretical bounds as those of the original spectral clustering algorithm. We
also extend the results to degree-corrected stochastic block models. Numerical
experiments support our theoretical findings and show the efficiency of
randomized methods. A new R package called Rclust is developed and made
available to the public.</span>

                    <span>This work studies how the introduction of the entropic regularization term in
unbalanced Optimal Transport (OT) models may alter their homogeneity with
respect to the input measures. We observe that in common settings (including
balanced OT and unbalanced OT with Kullback-Leibler divergence to the
marginals), although the optimal transport cost itself is not homogeneous,
optimal transport plans and the so-called Sinkhorn divergences are indeed
homogeneous. However, homogeneity does not hold in more general Unbalanced
Regularized Optimal Transport (UROT) models, for instance those using the Total
Variation as divergence to the marginals. We propose to modify the entropic
regularization term to retrieve an UROT model that is homogeneous while
preserving most properties of the standard UROT model. We showcase the
importance of using our Homogeneous UROT (HUROT) model when it comes to
regularize Optimal Transport with Boundary, a transportation model involving a
spatially varying divergence to the marginals for which the standard
(inhomogeneous) UROT model would yield inappropriate behavior.</span>

a large majority of the projections lie on vertices of the polytopes. To do
these projections efficiently we derive a vertex-oriented incremental algorithm
to project a point onto any arbitrary polytope, as well as give specific
algorithms to cater to simplex projection and polytopes where the unit box is
cut by planes. Such settings are especially useful in web-scale applications
such as optimal matching or allocation problems. Several such problems in
internet marketplaces (e-commerce, ride-sharing, food delivery, professional
services, advertising, etc.), can be formulated as Linear Programs (LP) with
such polytope constraints that require a projection step in the overall

                    <span>We study the transfer learning process between two linear regression
problems. An important and timely special case is when the regressors are
overparameterized and perfectly interpolate their training data. We examine a
parameter transfer mechanism whereby a subset of the parameters of the target
task solution are constrained to the values learned for a related source task.
We analytically characterize the generalization error of the target task in
terms of the salient factors in the transfer learning architecture, i.e., the
number of examples available, the number of (free) parameters in each of the
tasks, the number of parameters transferred from the source to target task, and
the relation between the two tasks. Our non-asymptotic analysis shows that the
generalization error of the target task follows a two-dimensional double
descent trend (with respect to the number of free parameters in each of the
tasks) that is controlled by the transfer learning factors. Our analysis points
to specific cases where the transfer of parameters is beneficial as a
substitute for extra overparameterization (i.e., additional free parameters in
the target task). Specifically, we show that the usefulness of a transfer
learning setting is fragile and depends on a delicate interplay among the set
of transferred parameters, the relation between the tasks, and the true
solution. We also demonstrate that overparameterized transfer learning is not
necessarily more beneficial when the source task is closer or identical to the
target task.</span>

networks, an important research objective to understand the behavior of neural
networks in modern applications involving autoencoders and loop unrolling
techniques, among others. In particular, we show that neural networks with
nonnegative inputs and nonnegative parameters can be recognized as monotonic
and (weakly) scalable functions within the framework of nonlinear
Perron-Frobenius theory. This fact enables us to derive conditions for the
existence of a nonempty fixed point set of the nonnegative neural networks, and
these conditions are weaker than those obtained recently using arguments in
convex analysis, which are typically based on the assumption of nonexpansivity
of the activation functions. Furthermore, we prove that the shape of the fixed
point set of monotonic and weakly scalable neural networks is often an
interval, which degenerates to a point for the case of scalable networks. The
chief results of this paper are verified in numerical simulations, where we
consider an autoencoder-type network that first compresses angular power
spectra in massive MIMO systems, and, second, reconstruct the input spectra

approach is based on a variation of the stochastic block model (SBM) with the
addition of triadic closure edges, and its inference can identify the most
plausible mechanism responsible for the existence of every edge in the network,
in addition to the underlying community structure itself. We show how the
method can evade the detection of spurious communities caused solely by the
formation of triangles in the network, and how it can improve the performance
of edge prediction when compared to the pure version of the SBM without triadic
closure.</span>

                    <span>We propose a new method for supervised learning with multiple sets of
features (&quot;views&quot;). Cooperative learning combines the usual squared error loss
of predictions with an &quot;agreement&quot; penalty to encourage the predictions from
different data views to agree. By varying the weight of the agreement penalty,
we get a continuum of solutions that include the well-known early and late
fusion approaches. Cooperative learning chooses the degree of agreement (or
fusion) in an adaptive manner, using a validation set or cross-validation to
estimate test set prediction error. One version of our fitting procedure is
modular, where one can choose different fitting mechanisms (e.g. lasso, random
forests, boosting, neural networks) appropriate for different data views. In
the setting of cooperative regularized linear regression, the method combines
the lasso penalty with the agreement penalty. The method can be especially
powerful when the different data views share some underlying relationship in
their signals that we aim to strengthen, while each view has its idiosyncratic
noise that we aim to reduce. We illustrate the effectiveness of our proposed
method on simulated and real data examples.</span>

                    <span>Tristructural isotropic (TRISO)-coated particle fuel is a robust nuclear fuel
and determining its reliability is critical for the success of advanced nuclear
technologies. However, TRISO failure probabilities are small and the associated
computational models are expensive. We used coupled active learning,
multifidelity modeling, and subset simulation to estimate the failure
probabilities of TRISO fuels using several 1D and 2D models. With multifidelity
modeling, we replaced expensive high-fidelity (HF) model evaluations with
information fusion from two low-fidelity (LF) models. For the 1D TRISO models,
we considered three multifidelity modeling strategies: only Kriging, Kriging LF
prediction plus Kriging correction, and deep neural network (DNN) LF prediction
plus Kriging correction. While the results across these multifidelity modeling
strategies compared satisfactorily, strategies employing information fusion
from two LF models consistently called the HF model least often. Next, for the
2D TRISO model, we considered two multifidelity modeling strategies: DNN LF
prediction plus Kriging correction (data-driven) and 1D TRISO LF prediction
plus Kriging correction (physics-based). The physics-based strategy, as
expected, consistently required the fewest calls to the HF model. However, the
data-driven strategy had a lower overall simulation time since the DNN
predictions are instantaneous, and the 1D TRISO model requires a non-negligible
simulation time.</span>

                    <span>We consider the joint design and control of discrete-time stochastic
dynamical systems over a finite time horizon. We formulate the problem as a
multi-step optimization problem under uncertainty seeking to identify a system
design and a control policy that jointly maximize the expected sum of rewards
collected over the time horizon considered. The transition function, the reward
function and the policy are all parametrized, assumed known and differentiable
with respect to their parameters. We then introduce a deep reinforcement
learning algorithm combining policy gradient methods with model-based
optimization techniques to solve this problem. In essence, our algorithm
iteratively approximates the gradient of the expected return via Monte-Carlo
sampling and automatic differentiation and takes projected gradient ascent
steps in the space of environment and policy parameters. This algorithm is
referred to as Direct Environment and Policy Search (DEPS). We assess the
performance of our algorithm in three environments concerned with the design
and control of a mass-spring-damper system, a small-scale off-grid power system
and a drone, respectively. In addition, our algorithm is benchmarked against a
state-of-the-art deep reinforcement learning algorithm used to tackle joint
design and control problems. We show that DEPS performs at least as well or
better in all three environments, consistently yielding solutions with higher
returns in fewer iterations. Finally, solutions produced by our algorithm are
also compared with solutions produced by an algorithm that does not jointly
optimize environment and policy parameters, highlighting the fact that higher
returns can be achieved when joint optimization is performed.</span>

                    <span>Assuming distributions are Gaussian often facilitates computations that are
otherwise intractable. We consider an agent who is designed to attain a low
information ratio with respect to a bandit environment with a Gaussian prior
distribution and a Gaussian likelihood function, but study the agent&#x27;s
performance when applied instead to a Bernoulli bandit. We establish a bound on
the increase in Bayesian regret when an agent interacts with the Bernoulli
bandit, relative to an information-theoretic bound satisfied with the Gaussian
bandit. If the Gaussian prior distribution and likelihood function are
sufficiently diffuse, this increase grows with the square-root of the time
horizon, and thus the per-timestep increase vanishes. Our results formalize the
folklore that so-called Bayesian agents remain effective when instantiated with
diffuse misspecified distributions.</span>

                    <span>What is learning? 20$^{st}$ century formalizations of learning theory --
which precipitated revolutions in artificial intelligence -- focus primarily on
$\mathit{in-distribution}$ learning, that is, learning under the assumption
that the training data are sampled from the same distribution as the evaluation
distribution. This assumption renders these theories inadequate for
characterizing 21$^{st}$ century real world data problems, which are typically
characterized by evaluation distributions that differ from the training data
distributions (referred to as out-of-distribution learning). We therefore make
a small change to existing formal definitions of learnability by relaxing that
assumption. We then introduce $\mathbf{learning\ efficiency}$ (LE) to quantify
the amount a learner is able to leverage data for a given problem, regardless
of whether it is an in- or out-of-distribution problem. We then define and
prove the relationship between generalized notions of learnability, and show
how this framework is sufficiently general to characterize transfer, multitask,
meta, continual, and lifelong learning. We hope this unification helps bridge
the gap between empirical practice and theoretical guidance in real world
problems. Finally, because biological learning continues to outperform machine
learning algorithms on certain OOD challenges, we discuss the limitations of
this framework vis-\&#x27;a-vis its ability to formalize biological learning,
suggesting multiple avenues for future research.</span>

                    <span>The paper introduces a novel conditional independence (CI) based method for
linear and nonlinear, lagged and contemporaneous causal discovery from
observational time series in the causally sufficient case. Existing CI-based
methods such as the PC algorithm and also common methods from other frameworks
suffer from low recall and partially inflated false positives for strong
autocorrelation which is an ubiquitous challenge in time series. The novel
method, PCMCI$^+$, extends PCMCI [Runge et al., 2019b] to include discovery of
contemporaneous links. PCMCI$^+$ improves the reliability of CI tests by
optimizing the choice of conditioning sets and even benefits from
autocorrelation. The method is order-independent and consistent in the oracle
case. A broad range of numerical experiments demonstrates that PCMCI$^+$ has
higher adjacency detection power and especially more contemporaneous
orientation recall compared to other methods while better controlling false
positives. Optimized conditioning sets also lead to much shorter runtimes than
the PC algorithm. PCMCI$^+$ can be of considerable use in many real world
application scenarios where often time resolutions are too coarse to resolve
time delays and strong autocorrelation is present.</span>

                    <span>Online Tensor Factorization (OTF) is a fundamental tool in learning
low-dimensional interpretable features from streaming multi-modal data. While
various algorithmic and theoretical aspects of OTF have been investigated
recently, a general convergence guarantee to stationary points of the objective
function without any incoherence or sparsity assumptions is still lacking even
for the i.i.d. case. In this work, we introduce a novel algorithm that learns a
CANDECOMP/PARAFAC (CP) basis from a given stream of tensor-valued data under
general constraints, including nonnegativity constraints that induce
interpretability of the learned CP basis. We prove that our algorithm converges
almost surely to the set of stationary points of the objective function under
the hypothesis that the sequence of data tensors is generated by an underlying
Markov chain. Our setting covers the classical i.i.d. case as well as a wide
range of application contexts including data streams generated by independent
or MCMC sampling. Our result closes a gap between OTF and Online Matrix
Factorization in global convergence analysis \commHL{for CP-decompositions}.
Experimentally, we show that our algorithm converges much faster than standard
algorithms for nonnegative tensor factorization tasks on both synthetic and
real-world data. Also, we demonstrate the utility of our algorithm on a diverse
set of examples from an image, video, and time-series data, illustrating how
one may learn qualitatively different CP-dictionaries from the same tensor data
by exploiting the tensor structure in multiple ways.</span>

                    <span>In this work, we study empirical risk minimization (ERM) within a federated
learning framework, where a central server minimizes an ERM objective function
using training data that is stored across $m$ clients. In this setting, the
Federated Averaging (FedAve) algorithm is the staple for determining
$\epsilon$-approximate solutions to the ERM problem. Similar to standard
optimization algorithms, the convergence analysis of FedAve only relies on
smoothness of the loss function in the optimization parameter. However, loss
functions are often very smooth in the training data too. To exploit this
additional smoothness, we propose the Federated Low Rank Gradient Descent
(FedLRGD) algorithm. Since smoothness in data induces an approximate low rank
structure on the loss function, our method first performs a few rounds of
communication between the server and clients to learn weights that the server
can use to approximate clients&#x27; gradients. Then, our method solves the ERM
problem at the server using inexact gradient descent. To show that FedLRGD can
have superior performance to FedAve, we present a notion of federated oracle
complexity as a counterpart to canonical oracle complexity. Under some
assumptions on the loss function, e.g., strong convexity in parameter,
$\eta$-H\&quot;older smoothness in data, etc., we prove that the federated oracle
complexity of FedLRGD scales like $\phi m(p/\epsilon)^{\Theta(d/\eta)}$ and
that of FedAve scales like $\phi m(p/\epsilon)^{3/4}$ (neglecting sub-dominant
factors), where $\phi\gg 1$ is a &quot;communication-to-computation ratio,&quot; $p$ is
the parameter dimension, and $d$ is the data dimension. Then, we show that when
$d$ is small and the loss function is sufficiently smooth in the data, FedLRGD
beats FedAve in federated oracle complexity. Finally, in the course of
analyzing FedLRGD, we also establish a result on low rank approximation of
latent variable models.</span>

                    <span>The problem of linear predictions has been extensively studied for the past
century under pretty generalized frameworks. Recent advances in the robust
statistics literature allow us to analyze robust versions of classical linear
models through the prism of Median of Means (MoM). Combining these approaches
in a piecemeal way might lead to ad-hoc procedures, and the restricted
theoretical conclusions that underpin each individual contribution may no
longer be valid. To meet these challenges coherently, in this study, we offer a
unified robust framework that includes a broad variety of linear prediction
problems on a Hilbert space, coupled with a generic class of loss functions.
Notably, we do not require any assumptions on the distribution of the outlying
data points ($\mathcal{O}$) nor the compactness of the support of the inlying
ones ($\mathcal{I}$). Under mild conditions on the dual norm, we show that for
misspecification level $\epsilon$, these estimators achieve an error rate of
$O(\max\left\{|\mathcal{O}|^{1/2}n^{-1/2}, |\mathcal{I}|^{1/2}n^{-1}
\right\}+\epsilon)$, matching the best-known rates in literature. This rate is
slightly slower than the classical rates of $O(n^{-1/2})$, indicating that we
need to pay a price in terms of error rates to obtain robust estimates.
Additionally, we show that this rate can be improved to achieve so-called
&#x60;&#x60;fast rates&quot; under additional assumptions.</span>

                    <span>Autoencoders are the simplest neural network for unsupervised learning, and
thus an ideal framework for studying feature learning. While a detailed
understanding of the dynamics of linear autoencoders has recently been
obtained, the study of non-linear autoencoders has been hindered by the
technical difficulty of handling training data with non-trivial correlations -
a fundamental prerequisite for feature extraction. Here, we study the dynamics
of feature learning in non-linear, shallow autoencoders. We derive a set of
asymptotically exact equations that describe the generalisation dynamics of
autoencoders trained with stochastic gradient descent (SGD) in the limit of
high-dimensional inputs. These equations reveal that autoencoders learn the
leading principal components of their inputs sequentially. An analysis of the
long-time dynamics explains the failure of sigmoidal autoencoders to learn with
tied weights, and highlights the importance of training the bias in ReLU
autoencoders. Building on previous results for linear networks, we analyse a
modification of the vanilla SGD algorithm which allows learning of the exact
principal components. Finally, we show that our equations accurately describe
the generalisation dynamics of non-linear autoencoders on realistic datasets
such as CIFAR10.</span>

with models&#x27; generalization abilities so that it fits in the standard machine
learning framework and can be efficiently computed. In contrast to the
state-of-the-art approach, which relies on the learner&#x27;s adaptation speed to
new distribution, the proposed approach only requires evaluating the model&#x27;s
generalization ability. We provide a theoretical explanation for the advantage
of the proposed method, and our experiments show that the proposed technique is
1.9--11.0$\times$ more sample efficient and 9.4--32.4 times quicker than the

be improved by letting a machine learning algorithm identify the best maturity

                    <span>This work studies the question of Representation Learning in RL: how can we
learn a compact low-dimensional representation such that on top of the
representation we can perform RL procedures such as exploration and
exploitation, in a sample efficient manner. We focus on the low-rank Markov
Decision Processes (MDPs) where the transition dynamics correspond to a
low-rank transition matrix. Unlike prior works that assume the representation
is known (e.g., linear MDPs), here we need to learn the representation for the
low-rank MDP. We study both the online RL and offline RL settings. For the
online setting, operating with the same computational oracles used in FLAMBE
(Agarwal et.al), the state-of-art algorithm for learning representations in
low-rank MDPs, we propose an algorithm REP-UCB Upper Confidence Bound driven
Representation learning for RL), which significantly improves the sample
complexity from $\widetilde{O}( A^9 d^7 / (\epsilon^{10} (1-\gamma)^{22}))$ for
FLAMBE to $\widetilde{O}( A^2 d^4 / (\epsilon^2 (1-\gamma)^{5}) )$ with $d$
being the rank of the transition matrix (or dimension of the ground truth
representation), $A$ being the number of actions, and $\gamma$ being the
discounted factor. Notably, REP-UCB is simpler than FLAMBE, as it directly
balances the interplay between representation learning, exploration, and
exploitation, while FLAMBE is an explore-then-commit style approach and has to
perform reward-free exploration step-by-step forward in time. For the offline
RL setting, we develop an algorithm that leverages pessimism to learn under a
partial coverage condition: our algorithm is able to compete against any policy
as long as it is covered by the offline distribution.</span>

                    <span>Evaluating the real-world performance of network protocols is challenging.
Randomized control trials (RCT) are expensive and inaccessible to most
researchers, while expert-designed simulators fail to capture complex behaviors
in real networks. We present CausalSim, a data-driven simulator for network
protocols that addresses this challenge. Learning network behavior from
observational data is complicated due to the bias introduced by the protocols
used during data collection. CausalSim uses traces from an initial RCT under a
set of protocols to learn a causal network model, effectively removing the
biases present in the data. Using this model, CausalSim can then simulate any
protocol over the same traces (i.e., for counterfactual predictions). Key to
CausalSim is the novel use of adversarial neural network training that exploits
distributional invariances that are present due to the training data coming
from an RCT. Our extensive evaluation of CausalSim on both real and synthetic
datasets and two use cases, including more than nine months of real data from
the Puffer video streaming system, shows that it provides accurate
counterfactual predictions, reducing prediction error by 44% and 53% on average
compared to expert-designed and standard supervised learning baselines.</span>

                    <span>We study the selection of adjustment sets for estimating the interventional
mean under an individualized treatment rule. We assume a non-parametric causal
graphical model with, possibly, hidden variables and at least one adjustment
set comprised of observable variables. Moreover, we assume that observable
variables have positive costs associated with them. We define the cost of an
observable adjustment set as the sum of the costs of the variables that
comprise it. We show that in this setting there exist adjustment sets that are
minimum cost optimal, in the sense that they yield non-parametric estimators of
the interventional mean with the smallest asymptotic variance among those that
control for observable adjustment sets that have minimum cost. Our results are
based on the construction of a special flow network associated with the
original causal graph. We show that a minimum cost optimal adjustment set can
be found by computing a maximum flow on the network, and then finding the set
of vertices that are reachable from the source by augmenting paths. The
optimaladj Python package implements the algorithms introduced in this paper.</span>

                    <span>Consider a panel data setting where repeated observations on individuals are
available. Often it is reasonable to assume that there exist groups of
individuals that share similar effects of observed characteristics, but the
grouping is typically unknown in advance. We propose a novel approach to
estimate such unobserved groupings for general panel data models. Our method
explicitly accounts for the uncertainty in individual parameter estimates and
remains computationally feasible with a large number of individuals and/or
repeated measurements on each individual. The developed ideas can be applied
even when individual-level data are not available and only parameter estimates
together with some quantification of uncertainty are given to the researcher.</span>

                    <span>The explicit low-rank regularization, e.g., nuclear norm regularization, has
been widely used in imaging sciences. However, it has been found that implicit
regularization outperforms explicit ones in various image processing tasks.
Another issue is that the fixed explicit regularization limits the
applicability to broad kinds of images since different images favor different
features captured by using different explicit regularizations. As such, this
paper proposes a new adaptive and implicit low-rank regularization that
captures the low-rank prior dynamically from the training data. At the core of
our new adaptive and implicit low-rank regularization is parameterizing the
Laplacian matrix in the Dirichlet energy-based regularization with a neural
network, and we call the proposed model \textit{AIR-Net}. Theoretically, we
show that the adaptive regularization of AIR-Net enhances the implicit
regularization and vanishes at the end of training. We validate AIR-Net&#x27;s
effectiveness on various benchmark tasks, indicating that the AIR-Net is
particularly favorable for the scenarios when the missing entries are
non-uniform. The code can be found at

                    <span>We consider reinforcement learning (RL) in Markov Decision Processes in which
an agent repeatedly interacts with an environment that is modeled by a
controlled Markov process. At each time step $t$, it earns a reward, and also
incurs a cost-vector consisting of $M$ costs. We design model-based RL
algorithms that maximize the cumulative reward earned over a time horizon of
$T$ time-steps, while simultaneously ensuring that the average values of the
$M$ cost expenditures are bounded by agent-specified thresholds
$c^{ub}_i,i&#x3D;1,2,\ldots,M$.

In order to measure the performance of a reinforcement learning algorithm
that satisfies the average cost constraints, we define an $M+1$ dimensional
regret vector that is composed of its reward regret, and $M$ cost regrets. The
reward regret measures the sub-optimality in the cumulative reward, while the
$i$-th component of the cost regret vector is the difference between its $i$-th
cumulative cost expense and the expected cost expenditures $Tc^{ub}_i$.

We prove that the expected value of the regret vector of UCRL-CMDP, is
upper-bounded as $\tilde{O}\left(T^{2\slash 3}\right)$, where $T$ is the time
horizon. We further show how to reduce the regret of a desired subset of the
$M$ costs, at the expense of increasing the regrets of rewards and the
remaining costs. To the best of our knowledge, ours is the only work that
considers non-episodic RL under average cost constraints, and derive algorithms
that can~\emph{tune the regret vector} according to the agent&#x27;s requirements on
its cost regrets.</span>

                    <span>Recent advancements in end-to-end deep learning models have enabled new and intriguing Text-to-Speech (TTS) use-cases with excellent natural-sounding outcomes. However, the majority of these models are trained on large datasets recorded with a single speaker in a professional setting. Expanding solutions to numerous languages and speakers is not viable for everyone in this situation. It is more challenging for low-resource languages not often studied by mainstream research.
 Coqui’s team has designed ‘YourTTS‘ to overcome these limits and provide zero-shot TTS to low-resource languages. It can synthesize voices in various languages and drastically reduce data requirements by transferring information between the training set. Continue Reading....

                    <span>Graph kernel approaches have typically been the most popular strategy for graph classification tasks. Graph kernels can be thought of as functions that measure the similarity of two graphs. They allow kernelized learning algorithms like support vector machines to work directly on charts rather than convert them to fixed-length, real-valued feature vectors through feature extraction. 
 In recent years, the use of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) based on high-performance message-passing neural networks has exploded (MPNNs). As a result, they’ve grown increasingly popular for graph categorization. However, their performance is limited by their hand-crafted combinatorial features. 
 Yale University and IBM researchers propose Kernel Graph Neural Networks (KerGNNs). KerGNNs are frameworks that combine graph kernels and the GNN message-passing procedure into one. They achieve results that are equivalent to cutting-edge approaches. Simultaneously, they vastly increase model interpretability when compared to traditional GNNs. Continue Reading....

                    <span>I am working on a hard sci fi project set several hundred years in the future. I&#x27;d like to show a data scientist running realistic (but interesting) tests on an android to see if it&#x27;s core SNN is intact.
 Ideally, this would be some kind of behavioral simulation, a series of tests that the android has to &quot;pass.&quot;
 Thought I should come to the experts for suggestions!

                    <span>I am trying to get into contrastive learning, and I have stumbled upon benchmarks like this: https://paperswithcode.com/sota/few-shot-image-classification-on-imagenet-10
 What exactly is meant by 10-shot? Is it just training on 10 random examples (selected beforehand for fairness)? How does it work?

                    <span>Even though the popularity of JAX is increasing everyday, open sourced code implementations are still hard to find. To counter this, I have created a repository with the goal to achieve something similar to timm for torch (except for the pretrained models because I don&#x27;t have the funds currently).
 Some features of jax_models: 1. Pip installable 2. Weekly / fortnightly model additions 3. Comprehensive tests 4. Model architectures are cross checked by checking original implementations if available or otherwise miscellaneous aspects of the paper such as model parameters
 The repository is currently in its pre-alpha stage with only around 6 model and layer implementations. If you are interested in this, you can contribute by either asking for specific paper implementations or by helping me train and open source weights of these models.
 If you like my work then please consider starring the repository and giving feedback. Thank you!

                    <span>I published a dataset of 5m source code files from 15k open source files. Its long term goal is to enable identifying causality in software engineering. 
 Describing paper: End to End Software Engineering Research
 People from ML, NLP, causality, and software engineering, might find it interesting.
 The dataset enables investigating code similarity (and also text similarity in English), program difficulty, defect predictions, etc.
 The code is extracted every two months in order to investigate the difference. By the difference one can investigate if a change in a possible cause (e.g., smell removal) leads to influence (less bugs)and in which context.
 I plan to keep extending the dataset and would like to get feedback on it - ease of use, new use cases, etc.
 If you have related dataset that can be merged with, related data that you would like to obtain or ideas for research directions, please contact me.

                    <span>Forward: &quot;Bayesian modeling provides an elegant approach to many data science and decision-making problems. However, it can be hard to make it work well in practice. In particular, although there are many software packages that make it easy to specify complex hierarchical models such as Stan, PyMC3, TensorFlow Probability (TFP), and Pyro, users still need additional tools to diagnose whether the results of their computations are correct or not. They may also need advice on what to do when things do go wrong.
 This book focuses on the ArviZ library, which enables users to perform exploratory analysis of Bayesian models, for example, diagnostics of posterior samples generated by any inference method. This can be used to diagnose a variety of failure modes in Bayesian inference. The book also discusses various modeling strategies (such as centering) that can be employed to eliminate many of the most common problems. Most of the examples in the book use PyMC3, although some also use TFP; a brief comparison of other probabilistic programming languages is also included.
 The authors are all experts in the area of Bayesian software and are major contributors to the PyMC3, ArviZ, and TFP libraries. They also have significant experience applying Bayesian data analysis in practice, and this is reflected in the practical approach adopted in this book. Overall, I think this is a valuable addition to the literature, which should hopefully further the adoption of Bayesian methods.&quot;

                    <span>So this is probably a basic question. If the main premise of neural networks is that they are global function approximators, what advantage do they have against other approximators such Fourier transform, which is also proven to be able to approximate any function. Why does not the whole supervised learning field become one of calculating Fourier coefficients

                    <span>My understanding is that if your research paper is denied from a conference, you would take the reviewer&#x27;s feedback, make some changes, then submit to the next big ML conference. The process repeats until the paper is eventually accepted somewhere. But how often is it the case where the paper isn&#x27;t accepted anywhere? How many papers are accepted on the first (or second) try? 
 I&#x27;m an undergrad who&#x27;s really new with the concept of publishing papers, so I thought it&#x27;s worth asking around here. :)

                    <span>In Pay Attention to MLPs, 
  
the authors said that it is necessary for the layer s(&#x27;) to contain a contraction operation over the spatial dimension. It&#x27;s hard to understand why s(&#x27;) should be a contraction operation. I think s(&#x27;) should maintain the spatial dimension for proper calculation. Why should s(&#x27;) be a contraction operation? 
 Can I say transformer dynamically parameterize spatial interactions with positional encoder? I am confused whether spatial interaction already contains the meaning of positional encoding. 
  
What do you think? Thank you in advance.

 Have any of you tried to optimize the neural network using the simulated annealing algorithm?
 I am referring to an example even on a simple neural network because I have a similar project and I will consider how to get started with the topic, so practical use would be extremely helpful ...
 Additionally, some scientific papers or hypothetical examples of use may also be helpful.
 Thanks in advance for your help.

                    <span>Graph kernel approaches have typically been the most popular strategy for graph classification tasks. Graph kernels can be thought of as functions that measure the similarity of two graphs. They allow kernelized learning algorithms like support vector machines to work directly on charts rather than convert them to fixed-length, real-valued feature vectors through feature extraction. 
 In recent years, the use of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) based on high-performance message-passing neural networks has exploded (MPNNs). As a result, they’ve grown increasingly popular for graph categorization. However, their performance is limited by their hand-crafted combinatorial features. 
 Yale University and IBM researchers propose Kernel Graph Neural Networks (KerGNNs). KerGNNs are frameworks that combine graph kernels and the GNN message-passing procedure into one. They achieve results that are equivalent to cutting-edge approaches. Simultaneously, they vastly increase model interpretability when compared to traditional GNNs. Continue Reading....

                    <span>I have a dataset of events that take place in football (soccer) games. This is being framed as a reinforcement learning issue by defining episodes to be the events (pass, shoot, dribble, etc) that take place when a team gains possession and loses it (by shooting, losing possession, etc). 
 I have created a simple NN that estimates what the next action will be from the possible action space as a probability distribution. This NN was trained on the historical data from past matches. I would like to know if there are any good pointers into implementing Policy Gradients to nudge the probability distribution learned by the NN in the direction of some reward function that I define. Ideally the advice would be for tensorflow as that is what I am familiar with.

                    <span>So a NN is good at scanning a thousand labelled pictures of a cat and then when it see&#x27;s a cat it has a high likelihood of knowing it&#x27;s a cat (if it is trained right).
 Can that same nn (with same or similar configuration) also determine a cat from a dog from a range of random animals, assuming weights were adjusted and training redone? Would I need two NN&#x27;s for that?
 Does first NN think it&#x27;s a cat? No? Okay - does 2nd NN think it&#x27;s a dog? Yes!

                    <span>The Covid-19 pandemic has been a scourge upon humanity, claiming the lives of
more than 5 million people worldwide. Although vaccines are being distributed
worldwide, there is an apparent need for affordable screening techniques to
serve parts of the world that do not have access to traditional medicine.
Artificial Intelligence can provide a solution utilizing cough sounds as the
primary screening mode. This paper presents multiple models that have achieved
relatively respectable perfor mance on the largest evaluation dataset currently
presented in academic literature. Moreover, we also show that performance
increases with training data size, showing the need for the world wide
collection of data to help combat the Covid-19 pandemic with non-traditional
means.</span>

                    <span>In this paper, we use support vector machines (SVM) to develop a machine
learning framework to discover phase space structures that distinguish between
distinct reaction pathways. The SVM model is trained using data from
trajectories of Hamilton&#x27;s equations and works well even with relatively few
trajectories. Moreover, this framework is specifically designed to require
minimal a priori knowledge of the dynamics in a system. This makes our approach
computationally better suited than existing methods for high-dimensional
systems and systems where integrating trajectories is expensive. We benchmark
our approach on Chesnavich&#x27;s CH$_4^+$ Hamiltonian.</span>

                    <span>Image denoising is a prerequisite for downstream tasks in many fields.
Low-dose and photon-counting computed tomography (CT) denoising can optimize
diagnostic performance at minimized radiation dose. Supervised deep denoising
methods are popular but require paired clean or noisy samples that are often
unavailable in practice. Limited by the independent noise assumption, current
unsupervised denoising methods cannot process correlated noises as in CT
images. Here we propose the first-of-its-kind similarity-based unsupervised
deep denoising approach, referred to as Noise2Sim, that works in a nonlocal and
nonlinear fashion to suppress not only independent but also correlated noises.
Theoretically, Noise2Sim is asymptotically equivalent to supervised learning
methods under mild conditions. Experimentally, Nosie2Sim recovers intrinsic
features from noisy low-dose CT and photon-counting CT images as effectively as
or even better than supervised learning methods on practical datasets visually,
quantitatively and statistically. Noise2Sim is a general unsupervised denoising
approach and has great potential in diverse applications.</span>

                    <span>An end-to-end communications system based on Orthogonal Frequency Division
Multiplexing (OFDM) is modeled as an autoencoder (AE) for which the transmitter
(coding and modulation) and receiver (demodulation and decoding) are
represented as deep neural networks (DNNs) of the encoder and decoder,
respectively. This AE communications approach is shown to outperform
conventional communications in terms of bit error rate (BER) under practical
scenarios regarding channel and interference effects as well as training data
and embedded implementation constraints. A generative adversarial network (GAN)
is trained to augment the training data when there is not enough training data
available. Also, the performance is evaluated in terms of the DNN model
quantization and the corresponding memory requirements for embedded
implementation. Then, interference training and randomized smoothing are
introduced to train the AE communications to operate under unknown and dynamic
interference (jamming) effects on potentially multiple OFDM symbols. Relative
to conventional communications, up to 36 dB interference suppression for a
channel reuse of four can be achieved by the AE communications with
interference training and randomized smoothing. AE communications is also
extended to the multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) case and its BER
performance gain with and without interference effects is demonstrated compared
to conventional MIMO communications.</span>

                    <span>Formant tracking is investigated in this study by using trackers based on
dynamic programming (DP) and deep neural nets (DNNs). Using the DP approach,
six formant estimation methods were first compared. The six methods include
linear prediction (LP) algorithms, weighted LP algorithms and the recently
developed quasi-closed phase forward-backward (QCP-FB) method. QCP-FB gave the
best performance in the comparison. Therefore, a novel formant tracking
approach, which combines benefits of deep learning and signal processing based
on QCP-FB, was proposed. In this approach, the formants predicted by a
DNN-based tracker from a speech frame are refined using the peaks of the
all-pole spectrum computed by QCP-FB from the same frame. Results show that the
proposed DNN-based tracker performed better both in detection rate and
estimation error for the lowest three formants compared to reference formant
trackers. Compared to the popular Wavesurfer, for example, the proposed tracker
gave a reduction of 29%, 48% and 35% in the estimation error for the lowest
three formants, respectively.</span>

                    <span>Deep learning has achieved great success in many applications. However, its
deployment in practice has been hurdled by two issues: the privacy of data that
has to be aggregated centrally for model training and high communication
overhead due to transmission of a large amount of data usually geographically
distributed. Addressing both issues is challenging and most existing works
could not provide an efficient solution. In this paper, we develop FedPC, a
Federated Deep Learning Framework for Privacy Preservation and Communication
Efficiency. The framework allows a model to be learned on multiple private
datasets while not revealing any information of training data, even with
intermediate data. The framework also minimizes the amount of data exchanged to
update the model. We formally prove the convergence of the learning model when
training with FedPC and its privacy-preserving property. We perform extensive
experiments to evaluate the performance of FedPC in terms of the approximation
to the upper-bound performance (when training centrally) and communication
overhead. The results show that FedPC maintains the performance approximation
of the models within $8.5\%$ of the centrally-trained models when data is
distributed to 10 computing nodes. FedPC also reduces the communication
overhead by up to $42.20\%$ compared to existing works.</span>

                    <span>Advances in deep learning have enabled a wide range of promising
applications. However, these systems are vulnerable to Adversarial Machine
Learning (AML) attacks; adversarially crafted perturbations to their inputs
could cause them to misclassify. Several state-of-the-art adversarial attacks
have demonstrated that they can reliably fool classifiers making these attacks
a significant threat. Adversarial attack generation algorithms focus primarily
on creating successful examples while controlling the noise magnitude and
distribution to make detection more difficult. The underlying assumption of
these attacks is that the adversarial noise is generated offline, making their
execution time a secondary consideration. However, recently, just-in-time
adversarial attacks where an attacker opportunistically generates adversarial
examples on the fly have been shown to be possible. This paper introduces a new
problem: how do we generate adversarial noise under real-time constraints to
support such real-time adversarial attacks? Understanding this problem improves
our understanding of the threat these attacks pose to real-time systems and
provides security evaluation benchmarks for future defenses. Therefore, we
first conduct a run-time analysis of adversarial generation algorithms.
Universal attacks produce a general attack offline, with no online overhead,
and can be applied to any input; however, their success rate is limited because
of their generality. In contrast, online algorithms, which work on a specific
input, are computationally expensive, making them inappropriate for operation
under time constraints. Thus, we propose ROOM, a novel Real-time Online-Offline
attack construction Model where an offline component serves to warm up the
online algorithm, making it possible to generate highly successful attacks
under time constraints.</span>

                    <span>We examine connections between combinatorial notions that arise in machine
learning and topological notions in cubical/simplicial geometry. These
connections enable to export results from geometry to machine learning. Our
first main result is based on a geometric construction by Tracy Hall (2004) of
a partial shelling of the cross-polytope which can not be extended. We use it
to derive a maximum class of VC dimension 3 that has no corners. This refutes
several previous works in machine learning from the past 11 years. In
particular, it implies that all previous constructions of optimal unlabeled
sample compression schemes for maximum classes are erroneous.

On the positive side we present a new construction of an unlabeled sample
compression scheme for maximum classes. We leave as open whether our unlabeled
sample compression scheme extends to ample (a.k.a. lopsided or extremal)
classes, which represent a natural and far-reaching generalization of maximum
classes. Towards resolving this question, we provide a geometric
characterization in terms of unique sink orientations of the 1-skeletons of
associated cubical complexes.</span>

                    <span>Deep neural networks have proved hugely successful, achieving human-like
performance on a variety of tasks. However, they are also computationally
expensive, which has motivated the development of model compression techniques
which reduce the resource consumption associated with deep learning models.
Nevertheless, recent studies have suggested that model compression can have an
adverse effect on algorithmic fairness, amplifying existing biases in machine
learning models. With this project we aim to extend those studies to the
context of facial expression recognition. To do that, we set up a neural
network classifier to perform facial expression recognition and implement
several model compression techniques on top of it. We then run experiments on
two facial expression datasets, namely the Extended Cohn-Kanade Dataset (CK+DB)
and the Real-World Affective Faces Database (RAF-DB), to examine the individual
and combined effect that compression techniques have on the model size,
accuracy and fairness. Our experimental results show that: (i) Compression and
quantisation achieve significant reduction in model size with minimal impact on
overall accuracy for both CK+DB and RAF-DB; (ii) in terms of model accuracy,
the classifier trained and tested on RAF-DB seems more robust to compression
compared to the CK+ DB; (iii) for RAF-DB, the different compression strategies
do not seem to increase the gap in predictive performance across the sensitive
attributes of gender, race and age which is in contrast with the results on the
CK+DB, where compression seems to amplify existing biases for gender. We
analyse the results and discuss the potential reasons for our findings.</span>

                    <span>Neural networks are known to be vulnerable to adversarial attacks -- slight
but carefully constructed perturbations of the inputs which can drastically
impair the network&#x27;s performance. Many defense methods have been proposed for
improving robustness of deep networks by training them on adversarially
perturbed inputs. However, these models often remain vulnerable to new types of
attacks not seen during training, and even to slightly stronger versions of
previously seen attacks. In this work, we propose a novel approach to
adversarial robustness, which builds upon the insights from the domain
adaptation field. Our method, called Adversarial Feature Desensitization (AFD),
aims at learning features that are invariant towards adversarial perturbations
of the inputs. This is achieved through a game where we learn features that are
both predictive and robust (insensitive to adversarial attacks), i.e. cannot be
used to discriminate between natural and adversarial data. Empirical results on
several benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach
against a wide range of attack types and attack strengths. Our code is
available at https://github.com/BashivanLab/afd.</span>

                    <span>Recent approaches in literature have exploited the multi-modal information in
documents (text, layout, image) to serve specific downstream document tasks.
However, they are limited by their - (i) inability to learn cross-modal
representations across text, layout and image dimensions for documents and (ii)
inability to process multi-page documents. Pre-training techniques have been
shown in Natural Language Processing (NLP) domain to learn generic textual
representations from large unlabelled datasets, applicable to various
downstream NLP tasks. In this paper, we propose a multi-task learning-based
framework that utilizes a combination of self-supervised and supervised
pre-training tasks to learn a generic document representation applicable to
various downstream document tasks. Specifically, we introduce Document Topic
Modelling and Document Shuffle Prediction as novel pre-training tasks to learn
rich image representations along with the text and layout representations for
documents. We utilize the Longformer network architecture as the backbone to
encode the multi-modal information from multi-page documents in an end-to-end
fashion. We showcase the applicability of our pre-training framework on a
variety of different real-world document tasks such as document classification,
document information extraction, and document retrieval. We evaluate our
framework on different standard document datasets and conduct exhaustive
experiments to compare performance against various ablations of our framework
and state-of-the-art baselines.</span>

                    <span>The machine learning (ML) life cycle involves a series of iterative steps,
from the effective gathering and preparation of the data, including complex
feature engineering processes, to the presentation and improvement of results,
with various algorithms to choose from in every step. Feature engineering in
particular can be very beneficial for ML, leading to numerous improvements such
as boosting the predictive results, decreasing computational times, reducing
excessive noise, and increasing the transparency behind the decisions taken
during the training. Despite that, while several visual analytics tools exist
to monitor and control the different stages of the ML life cycle (especially
those related to data and algorithms), feature engineering support remains
inadequate. In this paper, we present FeatureEnVi, a visual analytics system
specifically designed to assist with the feature engineering process. Our
proposed system helps users to choose the most important feature, to transform
the original features into powerful alternatives, and to experiment with
different feature generation combinations. Additionally, data space slicing
allows users to explore the impact of features on both local and global scales.
FeatureEnVi utilizes multiple automatic feature selection techniques;
furthermore, it visually guides users with statistical evidence about the
influence of each feature (or subsets of features). The final outcome is the
extraction of heavily engineered features, evaluated by multiple validation
metrics. The usefulness and applicability of FeatureEnVi are demonstrated with
two use cases and a case study. We also report feedback from interviews with
two ML experts and a visualization researcher who assessed the effectiveness of
our system.</span>

                    <span>This paper presents and characterizes an Open Application Repository for
Federated Learning (OARF), a benchmark suite for federated machine learning
systems. Previously available benchmarks for federated learning have focused
mainly on synthetic datasets and use a limited number of applications. OARF
mimics more realistic application scenarios with publicly available data sets
as different data silos in image, text and structured data. Our
characterization shows that the benchmark suite is diverse in data size,
distribution, feature distribution and learning task complexity. The extensive
evaluations with reference implementations show the future research
opportunities for important aspects of federated learning systems. We have
developed reference implementations, and evaluated the important aspects of
federated learning, including model accuracy, communication cost, throughput
and convergence time. Through these evaluations, we discovered some interesting
findings such as federated learning can effectively increase end-to-end
throughput.</span>

learn new tasks continually without catastrophically interfering with previous
knowledge. On the other hand, artificial neural networks suffer from
catastrophic forgetting and tend to only perform well on tasks that they were
recently trained on. In this work we explore the application of latent space

                    <span>We consider a matrix completion problem that exploits social or item
similarity graphs as side information. We develop a universal, parameter-free,
and computationally efficient algorithm that starts with hierarchical graph
clustering and then iteratively refines estimates both on graph clustering and
matrix ratings. Under a hierarchical stochastic block model that well respects
practically-relevant social graphs and a low-rank rating matrix model (to be
detailed), we demonstrate that our algorithm achieves the information-theoretic
limit on the number of observed matrix entries (i.e., optimal sample
complexity) that is derived by maximum likelihood estimation together with a
lower-bound impossibility result. One consequence of this result is that
exploiting the hierarchical structure of social graphs yields a substantial
gain in sample complexity relative to the one that simply identifies different
groups without resorting to the relational structure across them. We conduct
extensive experiments both on synthetic and real-world datasets to corroborate
our theoretical results as well as to demonstrate significant performance
improvements over other matrix completion algorithms that leverage graph side

                    <span>The Searching on Sorted Data ({\bf SOSD}, in short) is a highly engineered
software platform for benchmarking Learned Indexes, those latter being a novel
and quite effective proposal of how to search in a sorted table by combining
Machine Learning techniques with classic Algorithms. In such a platform and in
the related benchmarking experiments, following a natural and intuitive choice,
the final search stage is performed via the Standard (textbook) Binary Search
procedure. However, recent studies, that do not use Machine Learning
predictions, indicate that Uniform Binary Search, streamlined to avoid
\vir{branching} in the main loop, is superior in performance to its Standard
counterpart when the table to be searched into is relatively small, e.g.,
fitting in L1 or L2 cache. Analogous results hold for k-ary Search, even on
large tables. One would expect an analogous behaviour within Learned Indexes.
Via a set of extensive experiments, coherent with the State of the Art, we show
that for Learned Indexes, and as far as the {\bf SOSD} software is concerned,
the use of the Standard routine (either Binary or k-ary Search) is superior to
the Uniform one, across all the internal memory levels. This fact provides a
quantitative justification of the natural choice made so far. Our experiments
also indicate that Uniform Binary and k-ary Search can be advantageous to use
in order to save space in Learned Indexes, while granting a good performance in
time. Our findings are of methodological relevance for this novel and
fast-growing area and informative to practitioners interested in using Learned
Indexes in application domains, e.g., Data Bases and Search Engines.</span>

                    <span>Adversarial attacks make their success in &quot;fooling&quot; DNNs and among them,
gradient-based algorithms become one of the mainstreams. Based on the linearity
hypothesis [12], under $\ell_\infty$ constraint, $sign$ operation applied to
the gradients is a good choice for generating perturbations. However, the
side-effect from such operation exists since it leads to the bias of direction
between the real gradients and the perturbations. In other words, current
methods contain a gap between real gradients and actual noises, which leads to
biased and inefficient attacks. Therefore in this paper, based on the Taylor
expansion, the bias is analyzed theoretically and the correction of $\sign$,
i.e., Fast Gradient Non-sign Method (FGNM), is further proposed. Notably, FGNM
is a general routine, which can seamlessly replace the conventional $sign$
operation in gradient-based attacks with negligible extra computational cost.
Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods.
Specifically, ours outperform them by \textbf{27.5\%} at most and
\textbf{9.5\%} on average. Our anonymous code is publicly available:

                    <span>It has been argued by Thom and Palm that sparsely-connected neural networks
(SCNs) show improved performance over fully-connected networks (FCNs).
Super-regular networks (SRNs) are neural networks composed of a set of stacked
sparse layers of (epsilon, delta)-super-regular pairs, and randomly permuted
node order. Using the Blow-up Lemma, we prove that as a result of the
individual super-regularity of each pair of layers, SRNs guarantee a number of
properties that make them suitable replacements for FCNs for many tasks. These
guarantees include edge uniformity across all large-enough subsets, minimum
node in- and out-degree, input-output sensitivity, and the ability to embed
pre-trained constructs. Indeed, SRNs have the capacity to act like FCNs, and
eliminate the need for costly regularization schemes like Dropout. We show that
SRNs perform similarly to X-Nets via readily reproducible experiments, and
offer far greater guarantees and control over network structure.</span>

                    <span>In recent years, deep learning has successfully been applied to automate a
wide variety of tasks in diagnostic histopathology. However, fast and reliable
localization of small-scale regions-of-interest (ROI) has remained a key
challenge, as discriminative morphologic features often occupy only a small
fraction of a gigapixel-scale whole-slide image (WSI). In this paper, we
propose a sparse WSI analysis method for the rapid identification of high-power
ROI for WSI-level classification. We develop an evaluation framework inspired
by the early classification literature, in order to quantify the tradeoff
between diagnostic performance and inference time for sparse analytic
approaches. We test our method on a common but time-consuming task in pathology
- that of diagnosing gastric intestinal metaplasia (GIM) on hematoxylin and
eosin (H&amp;E)-stained slides from endoscopic biopsy specimens. GIM is a
well-known precursor lesion along the pathway to development of gastric cancer.
We performed a thorough evaluation of the performance and inference time of our
approach on a test set of GIM-positive and GIM-negative WSI, finding that our
method successfully detects GIM in all positive WSI, with a WSI-level
classification area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of
0.98 and an average precision (AP) of 0.95. Furthermore, we show that our
method can attain these metrics in under one minute on a standard CPU. Our
results are applicable toward the goal of developing neural networks that can
easily be deployed in clinical settings to support pathologists in quickly
localizing and diagnosing small-scale morphologic features in WSI.</span>

                    <span>High-quality estimates of uncertainty and robustness are crucial for numerous
real-world applications, especially for deep learning which underlies many
deployed ML systems. The ability to compare techniques for improving these
estimates is therefore very important for research and practice alike. Yet,
competitive comparisons of methods are often lacking due to a range of reasons,
including: compute availability for extensive tuning, incorporation of
sufficiently many baselines, and concrete documentation for reproducibility. In
this paper we introduce Uncertainty Baselines: high-quality implementations of
standard and state-of-the-art deep learning methods on a variety of tasks. As
of this writing, the collection spans 19 methods across 9 tasks, each with at
least 5 metrics. Each baseline is a self-contained experiment pipeline with
easily reusable and extendable components. Our goal is to provide immediate
starting points for experimentation with new methods or applications.
Additionally we provide model checkpoints, experiment outputs as Python
notebooks, and leaderboards for comparing results. Code available at

                    <span>Feature selection, as a vital dimension reduction technique, reduces data
dimension by identifying an essential subset of input features, which can
facilitate interpretable insights into learning and inference processes.
Algorithmic stability is a key characteristic of an algorithm regarding its
sensitivity to perturbations of input samples. In this paper, we propose an
innovative unsupervised feature selection algorithm attaining this stability
with provable guarantees. The architecture of our algorithm consists of a
feature scorer and a feature selector. The scorer trains a neural network (NN)
to globally score all the features, and the selector adopts a dependent sub-NN
to locally evaluate the representation abilities for selecting features.
Further, we present algorithmic stability analysis and show that our algorithm
has a performance guarantee via a generalization error bound. Extensive
experimental results on real-world datasets demonstrate superior generalization
performance of our proposed algorithm to strong baseline methods. Also, the
properties revealed by our theoretical analysis and the stability of our
algorithm-selected features are empirically confirmed.</span>

                    <span>This paper proposes a method for modeling human driver interactions that
relies on multi-output gaussian processes. The proposed method is developed as
a refinement of the game theoretical hierarchical reasoning approach called
&quot;level-k reasoning&quot; which conventionally assigns discrete levels of behaviors
to agents. Although it is shown to be an effective modeling tool, the level-k
reasoning approach may pose undesired constraints for predicting human decision
making due to a limited number (usually 2 or 3) of driver policies it extracts.
The proposed approach is put forward to fill this gap in the literature by
introducing a continuous domain framework that enables an infinite policy
space. By using the approach presented in this paper, more accurate driver
models can be obtained, which can then be employed for creating high fidelity
simulation platforms for the validation of autonomous vehicle control
algorithms. The proposed method is validated on a real traffic dataset and
compared with the conventional level-k approach to demonstrate its
contributions and implications.</span>

                    <span>Audio-based automatic speech recognition (ASR) degrades significantly in
noisy environments and is particularly vulnerable to interfering speech, as the
model cannot determine which speaker to transcribe. Audio-visual speech
recognition (AVSR) systems improve robustness by complementing the audio stream
with the visual information that is invariant to noise and helps the model
focus on the desired speaker. However, previous AVSR work focused solely on the
supervised learning setup; hence the progress was hindered by the amount of
labeled data available. In this work, we present a self-supervised AVSR
framework built upon Audio-Visual HuBERT (AV-HuBERT), a state-of-the-art
audio-visual speech representation learning model. On the largest available
AVSR benchmark dataset LRS3, our approach outperforms prior state-of-the-art by
~50% (28.0% vs. 14.1%) using less than 10% of labeled data (433hr vs. 30hr) in

                    <span>State-of-the-art machine learning models are routinely trained on large-scale
distributed clusters. Crucially, such systems can be compromised when some of
the computing devices exhibit abnormal (Byzantine) behavior and return
arbitrary results to the parameter server (PS). This behavior may be attributed
to a plethora of reasons, including system failures and orchestrated attacks.
Existing work suggests robust aggregation and/or computational redundancy to
alleviate the effect of distorted gradients. However, most of these schemes are
ineffective when an adversary knows the task assignment and can choose the
attacked workers judiciously to induce maximal damage. Our proposed method
Aspis assigns gradient computations to worker nodes using a subset-based
assignment which allows for multiple consistency checks on the behavior of a
worker node. Examination of the calculated gradients and post-processing
(clique-finding in an appropriately constructed graph) by the central node
allows for efficient detection and subsequent exclusion of adversaries from the
training process. We prove the Byzantine resilience and detection guarantees of
Aspis under weak and strong attacks and extensively evaluate the system on
various large-scale training scenarios. The principal metric for our

improvement of about 30% compared to many state-of-the-art approaches on the
CIFAR-10 dataset. The corresponding reduction of the fraction of corrupted
gradients ranges from 16% to 99%.</span>

                    <span>Permeability has a dominant influence on the flow properties of a natural
fluid. Lattice Boltzmann simulator determines permeability from the nano and
micropore network. The simulator holds millions of flow dynamics calculations
with its accumulated errors and high consumption of computing power. To
efficiently and consistently predict permeability, we propose a morphology
decoder, a parallel and serial flow reconstruction of machine learning
segmented heterogeneous Cretaceous texture from 3D micro computerized
tomography and nuclear magnetic resonance images. For 3D vision, we introduce
controllable-measurable-volume as new supervised segmentation, in which a
unique set of voxel intensity corresponds to grain and pore throat sizes. The
morphology decoder demarks and aggregates the morphologies boundaries in a
novel way to produce permeability. Morphology decoder method consists of five
novel processes, which describes in this paper, these novel processes are: (1)
Geometrical 3D Permeability, (2) Machine Learning guided 3D Properties
Recognition of Rock Morphology, (3) 3D Image Properties Integration Model for
Permeability, (4) MRI Permeability Imager, and (5) Morphology Decoder (the
process that integrates the other four novel processes).</span>

                    <span>While advances in multi-agent learning have enabled the training of
increasingly complex agents, most existing techniques produce a final policy
that is not designed to adapt to a new partner&#x27;s strategy. However, we would
like our AI agents to adjust their strategy based on the strategies of those
around them. In this work, we study the problem of conditional multi-agent
imitation learning, where we have access to joint trajectory demonstrations at
training time, and we must interact with and adapt to new partners at test
time. This setting is challenging because we must infer a new partner&#x27;s
strategy and adapt our policy to that strategy, all without knowledge of the
environment reward or dynamics. We formalize this problem of conditional
multi-agent imitation learning, and propose a novel approach to address the
difficulties of scalability and data scarcity. Our key insight is that
variations across partners in multi-agent games are often highly structured,
and can be represented via a low-rank subspace. Leveraging tools from tensor
decomposition, our model learns a low-rank subspace over ego and partner agent
strategies, then infers and adapts to a new partner strategy by interpolating
in the subspace. We experiments with a mix of collaborative tasks, including
bandits, particle, and Hanabi environments. Additionally, we test our
conditional policies against real human partners in a user study on the
Overcooked game. Our model adapts better to new partners compared to baselines,
and robustly handles diverse settings ranging from discrete/continuous actions
and static/online evaluation with AI/human partners.</span>

                    <span>Neural generative models can be used to learn complex probability
distributions from data, to sample from them, and to produce probability
density estimates. We propose a computational framework for developing neural
generative models inspired by the theory of predictive processing in the brain.
According to predictive processing theory, the neurons in the brain form a
hierarchy in which neurons in one level form expectations about sensory inputs
from another level. These neurons update their local models based on
differences between their expectations and the observed signals. In a similar
way, artificial neurons in our generative models predict what neighboring
neurons will do, and adjust their parameters based on how well the predictions
matched reality. In this work, we show that the neural generative models
learned within our framework perform well in practice across several benchmark
datasets and metrics and either remain competitive with or significantly
outperform other generative models with similar functionality (such as the
variational auto-encoder).</span>

                    <span>Artificial intelligence (AI) has become a part of everyday conversation and
our lives. It is considered as the new electricity that is revolutionizing the
world. AI is heavily invested in both industry and academy. However, there is
also a lot of hype in the current AI debate. AI based on so-called deep
learning has achieved impressive results in many problems, but its limits are
already visible. AI has been under research since the 1940s, and the industry
has seen many ups and downs due to over-expectations and related
disappointments that have followed.

The purpose of this book is to give a realistic picture of AI, its history,
its potential and limitations. We believe that AI is a helper, not a ruler of
humans. We begin by describing what AI is and how it has evolved over the
decades. After fundamentals, we explain the importance of massive data for the
current mainstream of artificial intelligence. The most common representations
for AI, methods, and machine learning are covered. In addition, the main
application areas are introduced. Computer vision has been central to the
development of AI. The book provides a general introduction to computer vision,
and includes an exposure to the results and applications of our own research.
Emotions are central to human intelligence, but little use has been made in AI.
We present the basics of emotional intelligence and our own research on the
topic. We discuss super-intelligence that transcends human understanding,
explaining why such achievement seems impossible on the basis of present
knowledge,and how AI could be improved. Finally, a summary is made of the
current state of AI and what to do in the future. In the appendix, we look at
the development of AI education, especially from the perspective of contents at
our own university.</span>

                    <span>Learning to solve combinatorial optimization problems, such as the vehicle
routing problem, offers great computational advantages over classical
operations research solvers and heuristics. The recently developed deep
reinforcement learning approaches either improve an initially given solution
iteratively or sequentially construct a set of individual tours. However, most
of the existing learning-based approaches are not able to work for a fixed
number of vehicles and thus bypass the complex assignment problem of the
customers onto an apriori given number of available vehicles. On the other
hand, this makes them less suitable for real applications, as many logistic
service providers rely on solutions provided for a specific bounded fleet size
and cannot accommodate short term changes to the number of vehicles. In
contrast we propose a powerful supervised deep learning framework that
constructs a complete tour plan from scratch while respecting an apriori fixed
number of available vehicles. In combination with an efficient post-processing
scheme, our supervised approach is not only much faster and easier to train but
also achieves competitive results that incorporate the practical aspect of
vehicle costs. In thorough controlled experiments we compare our method to
multiple state-of-the-art approaches where we demonstrate stable performance,
while utilizing less vehicles and shed some light on existent inconsistencies
in the experimentation protocols of the related work.</span>

                    <span>Biomedical research is growing in such an exponential pace that scientists,
researchers and practitioners are no more able to cope with the amount of
published literature in the domain. The knowledge presented in the literature
needs to be systematized in such a ways that claims and hypothesis can be
easily found, accessed and validated. Knowledge graphs can provide such
framework for semantic knowledge representation from literature. However, in
order to build knowledge graph, it is necessary to extract knowledge in form of
relationships between biomedical entities and normalize both entities and
relationship types. In this paper, we present and compare few rule-based and
machine learning-based (Naive Bayes, Random Forests as examples of traditional
machine learning methods and T5-based model as an example of modern deep
learning) methods for scalable relationship extraction from biomedical
literature for the integration into the knowledge graphs. We examine how
resilient are these various methods to unbalanced and fairly small datasets,
showing that T5 model handles well both small datasets, due to its pre-training
on large C4 dataset as well as unbalanced data. The best performing model was
T5 model fine-tuned on balanced data, with reported F1-score of 0.88.</span>

                    <span>Generative adversarial networks (GANs) with clustered latent spaces can
perform conditional generation in a completely unsupervised manner. In the real
world, the salient attributes of unlabeled data can be imbalanced. However,
most of existing unsupervised conditional GANs cannot cluster attributes of
these data in their latent spaces properly because they assume uniform
distributions of the attributes. To address this problem, we theoretically
derive Stein latent optimization that provides reparameterizable gradient
estimations of the latent distribution parameters assuming a Gaussian mixture
prior in a continuous latent space. Structurally, we introduce an encoder
network and novel unsupervised conditional contrastive loss to ensure that data
generated from a single mixture component represent a single attribute. We
confirm that the proposed method, named Stein Latent Optimization for GANs
(SLOGAN), successfully learns balanced or imbalanced attributes and achieves
state-of-the-art unsupervised conditional generation performance even in the
absence of attribute information (e.g., the imbalance ratio). Moreover, we
demonstrate that the attributes to be learned can be manipulated using a small
amount of probe data.</span>

objects -- has emerged as a promising avenue for characterizing the dark matter
population in our Galaxy. By leveraging recent advances in simulation-based
inference and neural network architectures, we introduce a novel method to
search for global dark matter-induced gravitational lensing signatures in
astrometric datasets. Our method based on neural likelihood-ratio estimation
shows significantly enhanced sensitivity to a cold dark matter population and
more favorable scaling with measurement noise compared to existing approaches
based on two-point correlation statistics. We demonstrate the real-world
viability of our method by showing it to be robust to non-trivial modeled as
well as unmodeled noise features expected in astrometric measurements. This
establishes machine learning as a powerful tool for characterizing dark matter
using astrometric data.</span>

realistic images and outperforms most previous approaches. In this article, we
reproduce the TryOnGAN implementation and probe it along diverse angles: impact
of transfer learning, variants of conditioning image generation with poses and
properties of latent space interpolation. Some of these facets have never been
explored in literature earlier. We find that transfer helps training initially
but gains are lost as models train longer and pose conditioning via
concatenation performs better. The latent space self-disentangles the pose and
the style features and enables style transfer across poses. Our code and models

                    <span>Due to the success of deep learning (DL) and its growing job market, students
and researchers from many areas are interested in learning about DL
technologies. Visualization has proven to be of great help during this learning
process. While most current educational visualizations are targeted towards one
specific architecture or use case, recurrent neural networks (RNNs), which are
capable of processing sequential data, are not covered yet. This is despite the
fact that tasks on sequential data, such as text and function analysis, are at
the forefront of DL research. Therefore, we propose exploRNN, the first
interactively explorable educational visualization for RNNs. On the basis of
making learning easier and more fun, we define educational objectives targeted
towards understanding RNNs. We use these objectives to form guidelines for the
visual design process. By means of exploRNN, which is accessible online, we
provide an overview of the training process of RNNs at a coarse level, while
also allowing a detailed inspection of the data flow within LSTM cells. In an
empirical study, we assessed 37 subjects in a between-subjects design to
investigate the learning outcomes and cognitive load of exploRNN compared to a
classic text-based learning environment. While learners in the text group are
ahead in superficial knowledge acquisition, exploRNN is particularly helpful
for deeper understanding of the learning content. In addition, the complex
content in exploRNN is perceived as significantly easier and causes less
extraneous load than in the text group. The study shows that for difficult
learning material such as recurrent networks, where deep understanding is
important, interactive visualizations such as exploRNN can be helpful.</span>

                    <span>Knowledge Graph Embedding (KGE) aims to learn representations for entities
and relations. Most KGE models have gained great success, especially on
extrapolation scenarios. Specifically, given an unseen triple (h, r, t), a
trained model can still correctly predict t from (h, r, ?), or h from (?, r,
t), such extrapolation ability is impressive. However, most existing KGE works
focus on the design of delicate triple modeling function, which mainly tells us
how to measure the plausibility of observed triples, but offers limited
explanation of why the methods can extrapolate to unseen data, and what are the
important factors to help KGE extrapolate. Therefore in this work, we attempt
to study the KGE extrapolation of two problems: 1. How does KGE extrapolate to
unseen data? 2. How to design the KGE model with better extrapolation ability?
For the problem 1, we first discuss the impact factors for extrapolation and
from relation, entity and triple level respectively, propose three Semantic
Evidences (SEs), which can be observed from train set and provide important
semantic information for extrapolation. Then we verify the effectiveness of SEs
through extensive experiments on several typical KGE methods. For the problem
2, to make better use of the three levels of SE, we propose a novel GNN-based
KGE model, called Semantic Evidence aware Graph Neural Network (SE-GNN). In
SE-GNN, each level of SE is modeled explicitly by the corresponding neighbor
pattern, and merged sufficiently by the multi-layer aggregation, which
contributes to obtaining more extrapolative knowledge representation. Finally,
through extensive experiments on FB15k-237 and WN18RR datasets, we show that
SE-GNN achieves state-of-the-art performance on Knowledge Graph Completion task
and performs a better extrapolation ability.</span>

                    <span>We argue the Fisher information matrix (FIM) of one hidden layer networks
with the ReLU activation function. Let $W$ denote the $d \times p$ weight
matrix from the $d$-dimensional input to the hidden layer consisting of $p$
neurons, and $v$ the $p$-dimensional weight vector from the hidden layer to the
scalar output. We focus on the FIM of $v$, which we denote as $I$. When $p$ is
large, under certain conditions, the following approximately holds. 1) There
are three major clusters in the eigenvalue distribution. 2) Since $I$ is
non-negative owing to the ReLU, the first eigenvalue is the Perron-Frobenius
eigenvalue. 3) For the cluster of the next maximum values, the eigenspace is
spanned by the row vectors of $W$. 4) The direct sum of the eigenspace of the
first eigenvalue and that of the third cluster is spanned by the set of all the
vectors obtained as the Hadamard product of any pair of the row vectors of $W$.
We confirmed by numerical simulation that the above is approximately correct
when the number of hidden nodes is about 10000.</span>

                    <span>This work studies the bias issue of pseudo-labeling, a natural phenomenon
that widely occurs but often overlooked by prior research. Pseudo-labels are
generated when a classifier trained on source data is transferred to unlabeled
target data. We observe heavy long-tailed pseudo-labels when a semi-supervised
learning model FixMatch predicts labels on the unlabeled set even though the
unlabeled data is curated to be balanced. Without intervention, the training
model inherits the bias from the pseudo-labels and end up being sub-optimal. To
eliminate the model bias, we propose a simple yet effective method DebiasMatch,
comprising of an adaptive debiasing module and an adaptive marginal loss. The
strength of debiasing and the size of margins can be automatically adjusted by
making use of an online updated queue. Benchmarked on ImageNet-1K, DebiasMatch
significantly outperforms previous state-of-the-arts by more than 26% and 8.7%

                    <span>Feature selection reduces the dimensionality of data by identifying a subset
of the most informative features. In this paper, we propose an innovative
framework for unsupervised feature selection, called fractal autoencoders
(FAE). It trains a neural network to pinpoint informative features for global
exploring of representability and for local excavating of diversity.
Architecturally, FAE extends autoencoders by adding a one-to-one scoring layer
and a small sub-neural network for feature selection in an unsupervised
fashion. With such a concise architecture, FAE achieves state-of-the-art
performances; extensive experimental results on fourteen datasets, including
very high-dimensional data, have demonstrated the superiority of FAE over
existing contemporary methods for unsupervised feature selection. In
particular, FAE exhibits substantial advantages on gene expression data
exploration, reducing measurement cost by about $15$\% over the widely used
L1000 landmark genes. Further, we show that the FAE framework is easily
extensible with an application.</span>

                    <span>GPUs are widely used to accelerate the training of machine learning
workloads. As modern machine learning models become increasingly larger, they
require a longer time to train, leading to higher GPU energy consumption. This
paper presents GPOEO, an online GPU energy optimization framework for machine
learning training workloads. GPOEO dynamically determines the optimal energy
configuration by employing novel techniques for online measurement,
multi-objective prediction modeling, and search optimization. To characterize
the target workload behavior, GPOEO utilizes GPU performance counters. To
reduce the performance counter profiling overhead, it uses an analytical model
to detect the training iteration change and only collects performance counter
data when an iteration shift is detected. GPOEO employs multi-objective models
based on gradient boosting and a local search algorithm to find a trade-off
between execution time and energy consumption. We evaluate the GPOEO by
applying it to 71 machine learning workloads from two AI benchmark suites
running on an NVIDIA RTX3080Ti GPU. Compared with the NVIDIA default scheduling
strategy, GPOEO delivers a mean energy saving of 16.2% with a modest average
execution time increase of 5.1%.</span>

                    <span>In model-free deep reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms, using noisy value
estimates to supervise policy evaluation and optimization is detrimental to the
sample efficiency. As this noise is heteroscedastic, its effects can be
mitigated using uncertainty-based weights in the optimization process. Previous
methods rely on sampled ensembles, which do not capture all aspects of
uncertainty. We provide a systematic analysis of the sources of uncertainty in
the noisy supervision that occurs in RL, and introduce inverse-variance RL, a
Bayesian framework which combines probabilistic ensembles and Batch Inverse
Variance weighting. We propose a method whereby two complementary uncertainty
estimation methods account for both the Q-value and the environment
stochasticity to better mitigate the negative impacts of noisy supervision. Our
results show significant improvement in terms of sample efficiency on discrete
and continuous control tasks.</span>

                    <span>A common approach to solving tasks, such as node classification or link
prediction, on a large network begins by learning a Euclidean embedding of the
nodes of the network, from which regular machine learning methods can be
applied. For unsupervised random walk methods such as DeepWalk and node2vec,
adding a $\ell_2$ penalty on the embedding vectors to the loss leads to
improved downstream task performance. In this paper we study the effects of
this regularization and prove that, under exchangeability assumptions on the
graph, it asymptotically leads to learning a nuclear-norm-type penalized
graphon. In particular, the exact form of the penalty depends on the choice of
subsampling method used within stochastic gradient descent to learn the
embeddings. We also illustrate empirically that concatenating node covariates
to $\ell_2$ regularized node2vec embeddings leads to comparable, if not
superior, performance to methods which incorporate node covariates and the
network structure in a non-linear manner.</span>

however, their approximation capabilities remain unexplored. This paper
rigorously analyses the approximation capabilities of existing
measure-preserving neural networks including NICE and RevNets. It is shown that
for compact $U \subset \R^D$ with $D\geq 2$, the measure-preserving neural
networks are able to approximate arbitrary measure-preserving map $\psi: U\to

health and survival, which contains physical, functional, and biological
variables, and is conditioned on demographic, lifestyle, and medical background
information. We combine techniques of modern machine learning with an
interpretable interaction network, where health variables are coupled by
explicit pair-wise interactions within a stochastic dynamical system. Our
dynamic joint interpretable network (DJIN) model is scalable to large
longitudinal data sets, is predictive of individual high-dimensional health
trajectories and survival from baseline health states, and infers an
interpretable network of directed interactions between the health variables.
The network identifies plausible physiological connections between health
variables as well as clusters of strongly connected health variables. We use
English Longitudinal Study of Aging (ELSA) data to train our model and show
that it performs better than multiple dedicated linear models for health
outcomes and survival. We compare our model with flexible lower-dimensional
latent-space models to explore the dimensionality required to accurately model
aging health outcomes. Our DJIN model can be used to generate synthetic
individuals that age realistically, to impute missing data, and to simulate
future aging outcomes given arbitrary initial health states.</span>

                    <span>Deep reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms are predominantly evaluated by
comparing their relative performance on a large suite of tasks. Most published
results on deep RL benchmarks compare point estimates of aggregate performance
such as mean and median scores across tasks, ignoring the statistical
uncertainty implied by the use of a finite number of training runs. Beginning
with the Arcade Learning Environment (ALE), the shift towards
computationally-demanding benchmarks has led to the practice of evaluating only
a small number of runs per task, exacerbating the statistical uncertainty in
point estimates. In this paper, we argue that reliable evaluation in the few
run deep RL regime cannot ignore the uncertainty in results without running the
risk of slowing down progress in the field. We illustrate this point using a
case study on the Atari 100k benchmark, where we find substantial discrepancies
between conclusions drawn from point estimates alone versus a more thorough
statistical analysis. With the aim of increasing the field&#x27;s confidence in
reported results with a handful of runs, we advocate for reporting interval
estimates of aggregate performance and propose performance profiles to account
for the variability in results, as well as present more robust and efficient
aggregate metrics, such as interquartile mean scores, to achieve small
uncertainty in results. Using such statistical tools, we scrutinize performance
evaluations of existing algorithms on other widely used RL benchmarks including
the ALE, Procgen, and the DeepMind Control Suite, again revealing discrepancies
in prior comparisons. Our findings call for a change in how we evaluate
performance in deep RL, for which we present a more rigorous evaluation
methodology, accompanied with an open-source library rliable, to prevent
unreliable results from stagnating the field.</span>

                    <span>Deep neural networks (DNNs) are notorious for making more mistakes for the
classes that have substantially fewer samples than the others during training.
Such class imbalance is ubiquitous in clinical applications and very crucial to
handle because the classes with fewer samples most often correspond to critical
cases (e.g., cancer) where misclassifications can have severe consequences. Not
to miss such cases, binary classifiers need to be operated at high True
Positive Rates (TPRs) by setting a higher threshold, but this comes at the cost
of very high False Positive Rates (FPRs) for problems with class imbalance.
Existing methods for learning under class imbalance most often do not take this
into account. We argue that prediction accuracy should be improved by
emphasizing reducing FPRs at high TPRs for problems where misclassification of
the positive, i.e. critical, class samples are associated with higher cost. To
this end, we pose the training of a DNN for binary classification as a
constrained optimization problem and introduce a novel constraint that can be
used with existing loss functions to enforce maximal area under the ROC curve
(AUC) through prioritizing FPR reduction at high TPR. We solve the resulting
constrained optimization problem using an Augmented Lagrangian method (ALM).
Going beyond binary, we also propose two possible extensions of the proposed
constraint for multi-class classification problems. We present experimental
results for image-based binary and multi-class classification applications
using an in-house medical imaging dataset, CIFAR10, and CIFAR100. Our results
demonstrate that the proposed method improves the baselines in majority of the
cases by attaining higher accuracy on critical classes while reducing the
misclassification rate for the non-critical class samples.</span>

                    <span>Software often produces biased outputs. In particular, machine learning (ML)
based software are known to produce erroneous predictions when processing
discriminatory inputs. Such unfair program behavior can be caused by societal
bias. In the last few years, Amazon, Microsoft and Google have provided
software services that produce unfair outputs, mostly due to societal bias
(e.g. gender or race). In such events, developers are saddled with the task of
conducting fairness testing. Fairness testing is challenging; developers are
tasked with generating discriminatory inputs that reveal and explain biases.

We propose a grammar-based fairness testing approach (called ASTRAEA) which
leverages context-free grammars to generate discriminatory inputs that reveal
fairness violations in software systems. Using probabilistic grammars, ASTRAEA
also provides fault diagnosis by isolating the cause of observed software bias.
ASTRAEA&#x27;s diagnoses facilitate the improvement of ML fairness.

ASTRAEA was evaluated on 18 software systems that provide three major natural
language processing (NLP) services. In our evaluation, ASTRAEA generated
fairness violations with a rate of ~18%. ASTRAEA generated over 573K
discriminatory test cases and found over 102K fairness violations. Furthermore,
ASTRAEA improves software fairness by ~76%, via model-retraining.</span>

                    <span>The exemplar-free class incremental learning requires classification models
to learn new class knowledge incrementally without retaining any old samples.
Recently, the framework based on parallel one-class classifiers (POC), which
trains a one-class classifier (OCC) independently for each category, has
attracted extensive attention, since it can naturally avoid catastrophic
forgetting. POC, however, suffers from weak discriminability and comparability
due to its independent training strategy for different OOCs. To meet this
challenge, we propose a new framework, named Discriminative and Comparable
One-class classifiers for Incremental Learning (DisCOIL). DisCOIL follows the
basic principle of POC, but it adopts variational auto-encoders (VAE) instead
of other well-established one-class classifiers (e.g. deep SVDD), because a
trained VAE can not only identify the probability of an input sample belonging
to a class but also generate pseudo samples of the class to assist in learning
new tasks. With this advantage, DisCOIL trains a new-class VAE in contrast with
the old-class VAEs, which forces the new-class VAE to reconstruct better for
new-class samples but worse for the old-class pseudo samples, thus enhancing
the comparability. Furthermore, DisCOIL introduces a hinge reconstruction loss
to ensure the discriminability. We evaluate our method extensively on MNIST,
CIFAR10, and Tiny-ImageNet. The experimental results show that DisCOIL achieves
state-of-the-art performance.</span>

                    <span>Cloud computing has become a major approach to enable reproducible
computational experiments because of its support of on-demand hardware and
software resource provisioning. Yet there are still two main difficulties in
reproducing big data applications in the cloud. The first is how to automate
end-to-end execution of big data analytics in the cloud including virtual
distributed environment provisioning, network and security group setup, and big
data analytics pipeline description and execution. The second is an application
developed for one cloud, such as AWS or Azure, is difficult to reproduce in
another cloud, a.k.a. vendor lock-in problem. To tackle these problems, we
leverage serverless computing and containerization techniques for automatic
scalable big data application execution and reproducibility, and utilize the
adapter design pattern to enable application portability and reproducibility
across different clouds. Based on the approach, we propose and develop an
open-source toolkit that supports 1) on-demand distributed hardware and
software environment provisioning, 2) automatic data and configuration storage
for each execution, 3) flexible client modes based on user preferences, 4)
execution history query, and 5) simple reproducibility of existing executions
in the same environment or a different environment. We did extensive
experiments on both AWS and Azure using three big data analytics applications
that run on a virtual CPU/GPU cluster. Three main behaviors of our toolkit were
benchmarked: i) execution overhead ratio for reproducibility support, ii)
differences of reproducing the same application on AWS and Azure in terms of
execution time, budgetary cost and cost-performance ratio, iii) differences
between scale-out and scale-up approach for the same application on AWS and
Azure.</span>

                    <span>We study time-series classification (TSC), a fundamental task of time-series
data mining. Prior work has approached TSC from two major directions: (1)
similarity-based methods that classify time-series based on the nearest
neighbors, and (2) deep learning models that directly learn the representations
for classification in a data-driven manner. Motivated by the different working
mechanisms within these two research lines, we aim to connect them in such a
way as to jointly model time-series similarities and learn the representations.
This is a challenging task because it is unclear how we should efficiently
leverage similarity information. To tackle the challenge, we propose
Similarity-Aware Time-Series Classification (SimTSC), a conceptually simple and
general framework that models similarity information with graph neural networks
(GNNs). Specifically, we formulate TSC as a node classification problem in
graphs, where the nodes correspond to time-series, and the links correspond to
pair-wise similarities. We further design a graph construction strategy and a
batch training algorithm with negative sampling to improve training efficiency.
We instantiate SimTSC with ResNet as the backbone and Dynamic Time Warping
(DTW) as the similarity measure. Extensive experiments on the full UCR datasets
and several multivariate datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of
incorporating similarity information into deep learning models in both
supervised and semi-supervised settings. Our code is available at

which reaches a lower gradient complexity of $O(\kappa^4\epsilon^{-4})$ for
finding an $\epsilon$-stationary point without large batches, which improves
the results of the existing adaptive GDA methods by a factor of
$O(\sqrt{\kappa})$. At the same time, we present an accelerated version of

technique, which achieves a lower gradient complexity of
$O(\kappa^{4.5}\epsilon^{-3})$ for finding an $\epsilon$-stationary point
without large batches, which improves the results of the existing adaptive GDA
methods by a factor of $O(\epsilon^{-1})$. Moreover, we prove that our
VR-AdaGDA method reaches the best known gradient complexity of
$O(\kappa^{3}\epsilon^{-3})$ with the mini-batch size $O(\kappa^3)$. In
particular, we provide an effective convergence analysis framework for our
adaptive GDA methods. Some experimental results on policy evaluation and fair
classifier tasks demonstrate the efficiency of our algorithms.</span>

                    <span>Adverse drug reactions / events (ADR/ADE) have a major impact on patient
health and health care costs. Detecting ADR&#x27;s as early as possible and sharing
them with regulators, pharma companies, and healthcare providers can prevent
morbidity and save many lives. While most ADR&#x27;s are not reported via formal
channels, they are often documented in a variety of unstructured conversations
such as social media posts by patients, customer support call transcripts, or
CRM notes of meetings between healthcare providers and pharma sales reps. In
this paper, we propose a natural language processing (NLP) solution that
detects ADR&#x27;s in such unstructured free-text conversations, which improves on
previous work in three ways. First, a new Named Entity Recognition (NER) model
obtains new state-of-the-art accuracy for ADR and Drug entity extraction on the
ADE, CADEC, and SMM4H benchmark datasets (91.75%, 78.76%, and 83.41% F1 scores
respectively). Second, two new Relation Extraction (RE) models are introduced -
one based on BioBERT while the other utilizing crafted features over a Fully
Connected Neural Network (FCNN) - are shown to perform on par with existing
state-of-the-art models, and outperform them when trained with a supplementary
clinician-annotated RE dataset. Third, a new text classification model, for
deciding if a conversation includes an ADR, obtains new state-of-the-art
accuracy on the CADEC dataset (86.69% F1 score). The complete solution is
implemented as a unified NLP pipeline in a production-grade library built on
top of Apache Spark, making it natively scalable and able to process millions
of batch or streaming records on commodity clusters.</span>

                    <span>Travel time is a crucial measure in transportation. Accurate travel time
prediction is also fundamental for operation and advanced information systems.
A variety of solutions exist for short-term travel time predictions such as
solutions that utilize real-time GPS data and optimization methods to track the
path of a vehicle. However, reliable long-term predictions remain challenging.
We show in this paper the applicability and usefulness of travel time i.e.
delivery time prediction for postal services. We investigate several methods
such as linear regression models and tree based ensembles such as random
forest, bagging, and boosting, that allow to predict delivery time by
conducting extensive experiments and considering many usability scenarios.
Results reveal that travel time prediction can help mitigate high delays in
postal services. We show that some boosting algorithms, such as light gradient
boosting and catboost, have a higher performance in terms of accuracy and
runtime efficiency than other baselines such as linear regression models,
bagging regressor and random forest.</span>

                    <span>The emergence of new nanoscale technologies has imposed significant
challenges to designing reliable electronic systems in radiation environments.
A few types of radiation like Total Ionizing Dose (TID) effects often cause
permanent damages on such nanoscale electronic devices, and current
state-of-the-art technologies to tackle TID make use of expensive
radiation-hardened devices. This paper focuses on a novel and different
approach: using machine learning algorithms on consumer electronic level Field
Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) to tackle TID effects and monitor them to
replace before they stop working. This condition has a research challenge to
anticipate when the board results in a total failure due to TID effects. We
observed internal measurements of the FPGA boards under gamma radiation and
used three different anomaly detection machine learning (ML) algorithms to
detect anomalies in the sensor measurements in a gamma-radiated environment.
The statistical results show a highly significant relationship between the
gamma radiation exposure levels and the board measurements. Moreover, our
anomaly detection results have shown that a One-Class Support Vector Machine
with Radial Basis Function Kernel has an average Recall score of 0.95. Also,
all anomalies can be detected before the boards stop working.</span>

                    <span>This paper presents local minimax regret lower bounds for adaptively
controlling linear-quadratic-Gaussian (LQG) systems. We consider smoothly
parametrized instances and provide an understanding of when logarithmic regret
is impossible which is both instance specific and flexible enough to take
problem structure into account. This understanding relies on two key notions:
That of local-uninformativeness; when the optimal policy does not provide
sufficient excitation for identification of the optimal policy, and yields a
degenerate Fisher information matrix; and that of
information-regret-boundedness, when the small eigenvalues of a
policy-dependent information matrix are boundable in terms of the regret of
that policy. Combined with a reduction to Bayesian estimation and application
of Van Trees&#x27; inequality, these two conditions are sufficient for proving
regret bounds on order of magnitude $\sqrt{T}$ in the time horizon, $T$. This
method yields lower bounds that exhibit tight dimensional dependencies and
scale naturally with control-theoretic problem constants. For instance, we are
able to prove that systems operating near marginal stability are fundamentally
hard to learn to control. We further show that large classes of systems satisfy
these conditions, among them any state-feedback system with both $A$- and
$B$-matrices unknown. Most importantly, we also establish that a nontrivial
class of partially observable systems, essentially those that are
over-actuated, satisfy these conditions, thus providing a $\sqrt{T}$ lower
bound also valid for partially observable systems. Finally, we turn to two
simple examples which demonstrate that our lower bound captures classical
control-theoretic intuition: our lower bounds diverge for systems operating
near marginal stability or with large filter gain -- these can be arbitrarily
hard to (learn to) control.</span>

the opportunities we have access to. Current audits for fairness are limited to
coarse-grained parity assessments at the level of sensitive groups. We propose
to audit for envy-freeness, a more granular criterion aligned with individual
preferences: every user should prefer their recommendations to those of other
users. Since auditing for envy requires to estimate the preferences of users
beyond their existing recommendations, we cast the audit as a new pure
exploration problem in multi-armed bandits. We propose a sample-efficient
algorithm with theoretical guarantees that it does not deteriorate user
experience. We also study the trade-offs achieved on real-world recommendation
datasets.</span>

                    <span>In bandits with distribution shifts, one aims to automatically detect an
unknown number $L$ of changes in reward distribution, and restart exploration
when necessary. While this problem remained open for many years, a recent
breakthrough of Auer et al. (2018, 2019) provide the first adaptive procedure
to guarantee an optimal (dynamic) regret $\sqrt{LT}$, for $T$ rounds, with no
knowledge of $L$. However, not all distributional shifts are equally severe,
e.g., suppose no best arm switches occur, then we cannot rule out that a regret
$O(\sqrt{T})$ may remain possible; in other words, is it possible to achieve
dynamic regret that optimally scales only with an unknown number of severe
shifts? This unfortunately has remained elusive, despite various attempts (Auer
et al., 2019, Foster et al., 2020).

We resolve this problem in the case of two-armed bandits: we derive an
adaptive procedure that guarantees a dynamic regret of order
$\tilde{O}(\sqrt{\tilde{L} T})$, where $\tilde L \ll L$ captures an unknown
number of severe best arm changes, i.e., with significant switches in rewards,
and which last sufficiently long to actually require a restart. As a
consequence, for any number $L$ of distributional shifts outside of these
severe shifts, our procedure achieves regret just $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{T})\ll
\tilde{O}(\sqrt{LT})$.

Finally, we note that our notion of severe shift applies in both classical
settings of stochastic switching bandits and of adversarial bandits.</span>

                    <span>Entropy coding is the backbone data compression. Novel machine-learning based
compression methods often use a new entropy coder called Asymmetric Numeral
Systems (ANS) [Duda et al., 2015], which provides very close to optimal
bitrates and simplifies [Townsend et al., 2019] advanced compression techniques
such as bits-back coding. However, researchers with a background in machine
learning often struggle to understand how ANS works, which prevents them from
exploiting its full versatility. This paper is meant as an educational resource
to make ANS more approachable by presenting it from a new perspective of latent
variable models and the so-called bits-back trick. We guide the reader step by
step to a complete implementation of ANS in the Python programming language,
which we then generalize for more advanced use cases. We also present and
empirically evaluate an open-source library of various entropy coders designed
for both research and production use. Related teaching videos and problem sets

                    <span>Self-supervision is recently surging at its new frontier of graph learning.
It facilitates graph representations beneficial to downstream tasks; but its
success could hinge on domain knowledge for handcraft or the often expensive
trials and errors. Even its state-of-the-art representative, graph contrastive
learning (GraphCL), is not completely free of those needs as GraphCL uses a
prefabricated prior reflected by the ad-hoc manual selection of graph data
augmentations. Our work aims at advancing GraphCL by answering the following
questions: How to represent the space of graph augmented views? What principle
can be relied upon to learn a prior in that space? And what framework can be
constructed to learn the prior in tandem with contrastive learning?
Accordingly, we have extended the prefabricated discrete prior in the
augmentation set, to a learnable continuous prior in the parameter space of
graph generators, assuming that graph priors per se, similar to the concept of
image manifolds, can be learned by data generation. Furthermore, to form
contrastive views without collapsing to trivial solutions due to the prior
learnability, we have leveraged both principles of information minimization
(InfoMin) and information bottleneck (InfoBN) to regularize the learned priors.
Eventually, contrastive learning, InfoMin, and InfoBN are incorporated
organically into one framework of bi-level optimization. Our principled and
automated approach has proven to be competitive against the state-of-the-art
graph self-supervision methods, including GraphCL, on benchmarks of small
graphs; and shown even better generalizability on large-scale graphs, without
resorting to human expertise or downstream validation. Our code is publicly
released at https://github.com/Shen-Lab/GraphCL_Automated.</span>

                    <span>Communication is defined as the act of sharing or exchanging information,
ideas or feelings. To establish communication between two people, both of them
are required to have knowledge and understanding of a common language. But in
the case of deaf and dumb people, the means of communication are different.
Deaf is the inability to hear and dumb is the inability to speak. They
communicate using sign language among themselves and with normal people but
normal people do not take seriously the importance of sign language. Not
everyone possesses the knowledge and understanding of sign language which makes
communication difficult between a normal person and a deaf and dumb person. To
overcome this barrier, one can build a model based on machine learning. A model
can be trained to recognize different gestures of sign language and translate
them into English. This will help a lot of people in communicating and
conversing with deaf and dumb people. The existing Indian Sing Language
Recognition systems are designed using machine learning algorithms with single
and double-handed gestures but they are not real-time. In this paper, we
propose a method to create an Indian Sign Language dataset using a webcam and
then using transfer learning, train a TensorFlow model to create a real-time
Sign Language Recognition system. The system achieves a good level of accuracy
even with a limited size dataset.</span>

                    <span>Modern kernel-based two-sample tests have shown great success in
distinguishing complex, high-dimensional distributions with appropriate learned
kernels. Previous work has demonstrated that this kernel learning procedure
succeeds, assuming a considerable number of observed samples from each
distribution. In realistic scenarios with very limited numbers of data samples,
however, it can be challenging to identify a kernel powerful enough to
distinguish complex distributions. We address this issue by introducing the
problem of meta two-sample testing (M2ST), which aims to exploit (abundant)
auxiliary data on related tasks to find an algorithm that can quickly identify
a powerful test on new target tasks. We propose two specific algorithms for
this task: a generic scheme which improves over baselines and a more tailored
approach which performs even better. We provide both theoretical justification
and empirical evidence that our proposed meta-testing schemes out-perform
learning kernel-based tests directly from scarce observations, and identify
when such schemes will be successful.</span>

                    <span>Machine learning models often encounter distribution shifts when deployed in
the real world. In this paper, we focus on adaptation to label distribution
shift in the online setting, where the test-time label distribution is
continually changing and the model must dynamically adapt to it without
observing the true label. Leveraging a novel analysis, we show that the lack of
true label does not hinder estimation of the expected test loss, which enables
the reduction of online label shift adaptation to conventional online learning.
Informed by this observation, we propose adaptation algorithms inspired by
classical online learning techniques such as Follow The Leader (FTL) and Online
Gradient Descent (OGD) and derive their regret bounds. We empirically verify
our findings under both simulated and real world label distribution shifts and
show that OGD is particularly effective and robust to a variety of challenging
label shift scenarios.</span>

                    <span>Complex systems (stars, supernovae, galaxies, and clusters) often exhibit low
scatter relations between observable properties (e.g., luminosity, velocity
dispersion, oscillation period, temperature). These scaling relations can
illuminate the underlying physics and can provide observational tools for
estimating masses and distances. Machine learning can provide a systematic way
to search for new scaling relations (or for simple extensions to existing
relations) in abstract high-dimensional parameter spaces. We use a machine
learning tool called symbolic regression (SR), which models the patterns in a
given dataset in the form of analytic equations. We focus on the
Sunyaev-Zeldovich flux$-$cluster mass relation ($Y_\mathrm{SZ}-M$), the scatter
in which affects inference of cosmological parameters from cluster abundance
data. Using SR on the data from the IllustrisTNG hydrodynamical simulation, we
find a new proxy for cluster mass which combines $Y_\mathrm{SZ}$ and
concentration of ionized gas ($c_\mathrm{gas}$): $M \propto
Y_\mathrm{conc}^{3/5} \equiv Y_\mathrm{SZ}^{3/5} (1-A\, c_\mathrm{gas})$.
$Y_\mathrm{conc}$ reduces the scatter in the predicted $M$ by $\sim 20-30$% for
large clusters ($M\gtrsim 10^{14}\, h^{-1} \, M_\odot$) at both high and low
redshifts, as compared to using just $Y_\mathrm{SZ}$. We show that the
dependence on $c_\mathrm{gas}$ is linked to cores of clusters exhibiting larger
scatter than their outskirts. Finally, we test $Y_\mathrm{conc}$ on clusters
from simulations of the CAMELS project and show that $Y_\mathrm{conc}$ is
robust against variations in cosmology, astrophysics, subgrid physics, and
cosmic variance. Our results and methodology can be useful for accurate
multiwavelength cluster mass estimation from current and upcoming CMB and X-ray
surveys like ACT, SO, SPT, eROSITA and CMB-S4.</span>

                    <span>Although deep neural networks have achieved great performance on
classification tasks, recent studies showed that well trained networks can be
fooled by adding subtle noises. This paper introduces a new approach to improve
neural network robustness by applying the recovery process on top of the
naturally trained classifier. In this approach, images will be intentionally
corrupted by some significant operator and then be recovered before passing
through the classifiers. SARGAN -- an extension on Generative Adversarial
Networks (GAN) is capable of denoising radar signals. This paper will show that
SARGAN can also recover corrupted images by removing the adversarial effects.
Our results show that this approach does improve the performance of naturally

                    <span>Stochastic majorization-minimization (SMM) is an online extension of the
classical principle of majorization-minimization, which consists of sampling
i.i.d. data points from a fixed data distribution and minimizing a recursively
defined majorizing surrogate of an objective function. In this paper, we
introduce stochastic block majorization-minimization, where the surrogates can
now be only block multi-convex and a single block is optimized at a time within
a diminishing radius. Relaxing the standard strong convexity requirements for
surrogates in SMM, our framework gives wider applicability including online
CANDECOMP/PARAFAC (CP) dictionary learning and yields greater computational
efficiency especially when the problem dimension is large. We provide an
extensive convergence analysis on the proposed algorithm, which we derive under
possibly dependent data streams, relaxing the standard i.i.d. assumption on
data samples. We show that the proposed algorithm converges almost surely to
the set of stationary points of a nonconvex objective under constraints at a
rate $O((\log n)^{1+\eps}/n^{1/2})$ for the empirical loss function and
$O((\log n)^{1+\eps}/n^{1/4})$ for the expected loss function, where $n$
denotes the number of data samples processed. Under some additional assumption,
the latter convergence rate can be improved to $O((\log n)^{1+\eps}/n^{1/2})$.
Our results provide first convergence rate bounds for various online matrix and
tensor decomposition algorithms under a general Markovian data setting.</span>

                    <span>Self-attention shows outstanding competence in capturing long-range
relationships while enhancing performance on vision tasks, such as image
classification and image captioning. However, the self-attention module highly
relies on the dot product multiplication and dimension alignment among
query-key-value features, which cause two problems: (1) The dot product
multiplication results in exhaustive and redundant computation. (2) Due to the
visual feature map often appearing as a multi-dimensional tensor, reshaping the
scale of the tensor feature to adapt to the dimension alignment might destroy
the internal structure of the tensor feature map. To address these problems,
this paper proposes a self-attention plug-in module with its variants, namely,
Synthesizing Tensor Transformations (STT), for directly processing image tensor
features. Without computing the dot-product multiplication among
query-key-value, the basic STT is composed of the tensor transformation to
learn the synthetic attention weight from visual information. The effectiveness
of STT series is validated on the image classification and image caption.
Experiments show that the proposed STT achieves competitive performance while
keeping robustness compared to self-attention based above vision tasks.</span>

                    <span>Recent years have witnessed growing interests in online incremental learning.
However, there are three major challenges in this area. The first major
difficulty is concept drift, that is, the probability distribution in the
streaming data would change as the data arrives. The second major difficulty is
catastrophic forgetting, that is, forgetting what we have learned before when
learning new knowledge. The last one we often ignore is the learning of the
latent representation. Only good latent representation can improve the
prediction accuracy of the model. Our research builds on this observation and
attempts to overcome these difficulties. To this end, we propose an Adaptive
Online Incremental Learning for evolving data streams (AOIL). We use
auto-encoder with the memory module, on the one hand, we obtained the latent
features of the input, on the other hand, according to the reconstruction loss
of the auto-encoder with memory module, we could successfully detect the
existence of concept drift and trigger the update mechanism, adjust the model
parameters in time. In addition, we divide features, which are derived from the
activation of the hidden layers, into two parts, which are used to extract the
common and private features respectively. By means of this approach, the model
could learn the private features of the new coming instances, but do not forget
what we have learned in the past (shared features), which reduces the
occurrence of catastrophic forgetting. At the same time, to get the fusion
feature vector we use the self-attention mechanism to effectively fuse the
extracted features, which further improved the latent representation learning.</span>

                    <span>Federated Learning (FL) trains a machine learning model on distributed
clients without exposing individual data. Unlike centralized training that is
usually based on carefully-organized data, FL deals with on-device data that
are often unfiltered and imbalanced. As a result, conventional FL training
protocol that treats all data equally leads to a waste of local computational
resources and slows down the global learning process. To this end, we propose
FedBalancer, a systematic FL framework that actively selects clients&#x27; training
samples. Our sample selection strategy prioritizes more &quot;informative&quot; data
while respecting privacy and computational capabilities of clients. To better
utilize the sample selection to speed up global training, we further introduce
an adaptive deadline control scheme that predicts the optimal deadline for each
round with varying client train data. Compared with existing FL algorithms with
deadline configuration methods, our evaluation on five datasets from three
different domains shows that FedBalancer improves the time-to-accuracy
performance by 1.22~4.62x while improving the model accuracy by 1.0~3.3%. We
also show that FedBalancer is readily applicable to other FL approaches by
demonstrating that FedBalancer improves the convergence speed and accuracy when
operating jointly with three different FL algorithms.</span>

                    <span>Learning-based control of linear systems received a lot of attentions
recently. In popular settings, the true dynamical models are unknown to the
decision-maker and need to be interactively learned by applying control inputs
to the systems. Unlike the matured literature of efficient reinforcement
learning policies for adaptive control of a single system, results on joint
learning of multiple systems are not currently available. Especially, the
important problem of fast and reliable joint-stabilization remains unaddressed
and so is the focus of this work. We propose a novel joint learning-based
stabilization algorithm for quickly learning stabilizing policies for all
systems understudy, from the data of unstable state trajectories. The presented
procedure is shown to be notably effective such that it stabilizes the family
of dynamical systems in an extremely short time period.</span>

                    <span>This paper investigates the dynamics of competition among organizations with
unequal expertise. Multi-agent reinforcement learning has been used to simulate
and understand the impact of various incentive schemes designed to offset such
inequality. We design Touch-Mark, a game based on well-known
multi-agent-particle-environment, where two teams (weak, strong) with unequal
but changing skill levels compete against each other. For training such a game,
we propose a novel controller assisted multi-agent reinforcement learning
algorithm \our\, which empowers each agent with an ensemble of policies along
with a supervised controller that by selectively partitioning the sample space,
triggers intelligent role division among the teammates. Using C-MADDPG as an
underlying framework, we propose an incentive scheme for the weak team such
that the final rewards of both teams become the same. We find that in spite of
the incentive, the final reward of the weak team falls short of the strong
team. On inspecting, we realize that an overall incentive scheme for the weak
team does not incentivize the weaker agents within that team to learn and
improve. To offset this, we now specially incentivize the weaker player to
learn and as a result, observe that the weak team beyond an initial phase
performs at par with the stronger team. The final goal of the paper has been to
formulate a dynamic incentive scheme that continuously balances the reward of
the two teams. This is achieved by devising an incentive scheme enriched with
an RL agent which takes minimum information from the environment.</span>

                    <span>Traditional text classification approaches often require a good amount of
labeled data, which is difficult to obtain, especially in restricted domains or
less widespread languages. This lack of labeled data has led to the rise of
low-resource methods, that assume low data availability in natural language
processing. Among them, zero-shot learning stands out, which consists of
learning a classifier without any previously labeled data. The best results
reported with this approach use language models such as Transformers, but fall
into two problems: high execution time and inability to handle long texts as
input. This paper proposes a new model, ZeroBERTo, which leverages an
unsupervised clustering step to obtain a compressed data representation before
the classification task. We show that ZeroBERTo has better performance for long
inputs and shorter execution time, outperforming XLM-R by about 12% in the F1
score in the FolhaUOL dataset. Keywords: Low-Resource NLP, Unlabeled data,

                    <span>Control barrier functions (CBFs) have become a popular tool to enforce safety
of a control system. CBFs are commonly utilized in a quadratic program
formulation (CBF-QP) as safety-critical constraints. A class $\mathcal{K}$
function in CBFs usually needs to be tuned manually in order to balance the
trade-off between performance and safety for each environment. However, this
process is often heuristic and can become intractable for high relative-degree
systems. Moreover, it prevents the CBF-QP from generalizing to different
environments in the real world. By embedding the optimization procedure of the
CBF-QP as a differentiable layer within a deep learning architecture, we
propose a differentiable optimization-based safety-critical control framework
that enables generalization to new environments with forward invariance
guarantees. Finally, we validate the proposed control design with 2D double and
quadruple integrator systems in various environments.</span>

feature, and global levels on a graph under the node classification task.
However, the computation burden now becomes the most significant issue because
the relevance of both graph structure and node attributes are computed on a
graph. In order to solve this issue, only relevant representative node
attributes are extracted by graph feature filters, allowing calculations to be
performed in a category-oriented manner. Experiments on seven datasets show
that Graph Decipher achieves state-of-the-art performance while imposing a
substantially lower computation burden under the node classification task.
Additionally, since our algorithm has the ability to explore the representative
node attributes by category, it is utilized to alleviate the imbalanced node
classification problem on multi-class graph datasets.</span>

                    <span>In this letter, the authors propose a two-step approach to evaluate and
verify a true system&#x27;s capacity to satisfy its operational objective.
Specifically, whenever the system objective has a quantifiable measure of
satisfaction, i.e. a signal temporal logic specification, a barrier function,
etc - the authors develop two separate optimization problems solvable via a
Bayesian Optimization procedure detailed within. This dual approach has the
added benefit of quantifying the Sim2Real Gap between a system simulator and
its hardware counterpart. Our contributions are twofold. First, we show
repeatability with respect to our outlined optimization procedure in solving
these optimization problems. Second, we show that the same procedure can
discriminate between different environments by identifying the Sim2Real Gap
between a simulator and its hardware counterpart operating in different
environments.</span>

                    <span>Federated learning (FL) is a widely adopted distributed learning paradigm in
practice, which intends to preserve users&#x27; data privacy while leveraging the
entire dataset of all participants for training. In FL, multiple models are
trained independently on the users and aggregated centrally to update a global
model in an iterative process. Although this approach is excellent at
preserving privacy by design, FL still tends to suffer from quality issues such
as attacks or byzantine faults. Some recent attempts have been made to address
such quality challenges on the robust aggregation techniques for FL. However,
the effectiveness of state-of-the-art (SOTA) robust FL techniques is still
unclear and lacks a comprehensive study. Therefore, to better understand the
current quality status and challenges of these SOTA FL techniques in the
presence of attacks and faults, in this paper, we perform a large-scale
empirical study to investigate the SOTA FL&#x27;s quality from multiple angles of
attacks, simulated faults (via mutation operators), and aggregation (defense)
methods. In particular, we perform our study on two generic image datasets and
one real-world federated medical image dataset. We also systematically
investigate the effect of the distribution of attacks/faults over users and the
independent and identically distributed (IID) factors, per dataset, on the
robustness results. After a large-scale analysis with 496 configurations, we
find that most mutators on each individual user have a negligible effect on the
final model. Moreover, choosing the most robust FL aggregator depends on the
attacks and datasets. Finally, we illustrate that it is possible to achieve a
generic solution that works almost as well or even better than any single
aggregator on all attacks and configurations with a simple ensemble model of
aggregators.</span>

                    <span>Deep learning methods can classify various unstructured data such as images,
language, and voice as input data. As the task of classifying anomalies becomes
more important in the real world, various methods exist for classifying using
deep learning with data collected in the real world. As the task of classifying
anomalies becomes more important in the real world, there are various methods
for classifying using deep learning with data collected in the real world.
Among the various methods, the representative approach is a method of
extracting and learning the main features based on a transition model from
pre-trained models, and a method of learning an autoencoderbased structure only
with normal data and classifying it as abnormal through a threshold value.
However, if the dataset is imbalanced, even the state-of-the-arts models do not
achieve good performance. This can be addressed by augmenting normal and
abnormal features in imbalanced data as features with strong distinction. We
use the features of the autoencoder to train latent vectors from low to high
dimensionality. We train normal and abnormal data as a feature that has a
strong distinction among the features of imbalanced data. We propose a latent
vector expansion autoencoder model that improves classification performance at
imbalanced data. The proposed method shows performance improvement compared to
the basic autoencoder using imbalanced anomaly dataset.</span>

                    <span>Massive MIMO systems are highly efficient but critically rely on accurate
channel state information (CSI) at the base station in order to determine
appropriate precoders. CSI acquisition requires sending pilot symbols which
induce an important overhead. In this paper, a method whose objective is to
determine an appropriate precoder from the knowledge of the user&#x27;s location
only is proposed. Such a way to determine precoders is known as location based
beamforming. It allows to reduce or even eliminate the need for pilot symbols,
depending on how the location is obtained. the proposed method learns a direct
mapping from location to precoder in a supervised way. It involves a neural
network with a specific structure based on random Fourier features allowing to
learn functions containing high spatial frequencies. It is assessed empirically
and yields promising results on realistic synthetic channels. As opposed to
previously proposed methods, it allows to handle both line-of-sight (LOS) and
non-line-of-sight (NLOS) channels.</span>

system. Due to their complexity, optimizers take experts months to write and
years to refine. In this work, we demonstrate for the first time that learning
to optimize queries without learning from an expert optimizer is both possible
and efficient. We present Balsa, a query optimizer built by deep reinforcement
learning. Balsa first learns basic knowledge from a simple,
environment-agnostic simulator, followed by safe learning in real execution. On
the Join Order Benchmark, Balsa matches the performance of two expert query
optimizers, both open-source and commercial, with two hours of learning, and
outperforms them by up to 2.8$\times$ in workload runtime after a few more
hours. Balsa thus opens the possibility of automatically learning to optimize
in future compute environments where expert-designed optimizers do not exist.</span>

                    <span>This paper introduces a new neural network-based estimation approach that is
inspired by the biological phenomenon whereby humans and animals vary the
levels of attention and effort that they dedicate to a problem depending upon
its difficulty. The proposed approach leverages alternate models&#x27; internal
levels of confidence in their own projections. If the least costly model is
confident in its classification, then that is the classification used; if not,
the model with the next lowest cost of implementation is run, and so on. This
use of successively more complex models -- together with the models&#x27; internal
propensity scores to evaluate their likelihood of being correct -- makes it
possible to substantially reduce resource use while maintaining high standards
for classification accuracy. The approach is applied to the digit recognition
problem from Google&#x27;s Street View House Numbers dataset, using Multilayer
Perceptron (MLP) neural networks trained on high- and low-resolution versions
of the digit images. The algorithm examines the low-resolution images first,
only moving to higher resolution images if the classification from the initial
low-resolution pass does not have a high degree of confidence. For the MLPs
considered here, this sequential approach enables a reduction in resource usage
of more than 50\% without any sacrifice in classification accuracy.</span>

commonly employed to handle time-varying reward distributions: adversarial
bandit and nonstationary bandit. Although their oracles, algorithms, and regret
analysis differ significantly, we provide a unified formulation in this paper
that smoothly bridges the two as special cases. The formulation uses an oracle
that takes the best-fixed arm within time windows. Depending on the window
size, it turns into the oracle in hindsight in the adversarial bandit and
dynamic oracle in the nonstationary bandit. We provide algorithms that attain
the optimal regret with the matching lower bound.</span>

                    <span>Static graph neural networks have been widely used in modeling and
representation learning of graph structure data. However, many real-world
problems, such as social networks, financial transactions, recommendation
systems, etc., are dynamic, that is, nodes and edges are added or deleted over
time. Therefore, in recent years, dynamic graph neural networks have received
more and more attention from researchers. In this work, we propose a novel
dynamic graph neural network, Efficient-Dyn. It adaptively encodes temporal
information into a sequence of patches with an equal amount of
temporal-topological structure. Therefore, while avoiding the use of snapshots
to cause information loss, it also achieves a finer time granularity, which is
close to what continuous networks could provide. In addition, we also designed
a lightweight module, Sparse Temporal Transformer, to compute node
representations through both structural neighborhoods and temporal dynamics.
Since the fully-connected attention conjunction is simplified, the computation
cost is far lower than the current state-of-the-arts. Link prediction
experiments are conducted on both continuous and discrete graph datasets.
Through comparing with several state-of-the-art graph embedding baselines, the
experimental results demonstrate that Efficient-Dyn has a faster inference
speed while having competitive performance.</span>

applications involving computer vision and natural language processing. The
type of pretext task is important to this boost in performance. One common
pretext task is the measure of similarity and dissimilarity between pairs of
images. In this scenario, the two images that make up the negative pair are
visibly different to humans. However, in entomology, species are nearly
indistinguishable and thus hard to differentiate. In this study, we explored
the performance of a Siamese neural network using contrastive loss by learning
to push apart embeddings of bumblebee species pair that are dissimilar, and
pull together similar embeddings. Our experimental results show a 61% F1-score
on zero-shot instances, a performance showing 11% improvement on samples of
classes that share intersections with the training set.</span>

                    <span>In bandits with distribution shifts, one aims to automatically detect an
unknown number $L$ of changes in reward distribution, and restart exploration
when necessary. While this problem remained open for many years, a recent
breakthrough of Auer et al. (2018, 2019) provide the first adaptive procedure
to guarantee an optimal (dynamic) regret $\sqrt{LT}$, for $T$ rounds, with no
knowledge of $L$. However, not all distributional shifts are equally severe,
e.g., suppose no best arm switches occur, then we cannot rule out that a regret
$O(\sqrt{T})$ may remain possible; in other words, is it possible to achieve
dynamic regret that optimally scales only with an unknown number of severe
shifts? This unfortunately has remained elusive, despite various attempts (Auer
et al., 2019, Foster et al., 2020).

We resolve this problem in the case of two-armed bandits: we derive an
adaptive procedure that guarantees a dynamic regret of order
$\tilde{O}(\sqrt{\tilde{L} T})$, where $\tilde L \ll L$ captures an unknown
number of severe best arm changes, i.e., with significant switches in rewards,
and which last sufficiently long to actually require a restart. As a
consequence, for any number $L$ of distributional shifts outside of these
severe shifts, our procedure achieves regret just $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{T})\ll
\tilde{O}(\sqrt{LT})$.

Finally, we note that our notion of severe shift applies in both classical
settings of stochastic switching bandits and of adversarial bandits.</span>

                    <span>Deep reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms are predominantly evaluated by
comparing their relative performance on a large suite of tasks. Most published
results on deep RL benchmarks compare point estimates of aggregate performance
such as mean and median scores across tasks, ignoring the statistical
uncertainty implied by the use of a finite number of training runs. Beginning
with the Arcade Learning Environment (ALE), the shift towards
computationally-demanding benchmarks has led to the practice of evaluating only
a small number of runs per task, exacerbating the statistical uncertainty in
point estimates. In this paper, we argue that reliable evaluation in the few
run deep RL regime cannot ignore the uncertainty in results without running the
risk of slowing down progress in the field. We illustrate this point using a
case study on the Atari 100k benchmark, where we find substantial discrepancies
between conclusions drawn from point estimates alone versus a more thorough
statistical analysis. With the aim of increasing the field&#x27;s confidence in
reported results with a handful of runs, we advocate for reporting interval
estimates of aggregate performance and propose performance profiles to account
for the variability in results, as well as present more robust and efficient
aggregate metrics, such as interquartile mean scores, to achieve small
uncertainty in results. Using such statistical tools, we scrutinize performance
evaluations of existing algorithms on other widely used RL benchmarks including
the ALE, Procgen, and the DeepMind Control Suite, again revealing discrepancies
in prior comparisons. Our findings call for a change in how we evaluate
performance in deep RL, for which we present a more rigorous evaluation
methodology, accompanied with an open-source library rliable, to prevent
unreliable results from stagnating the field.</span>

                    <span>We perform a systematic analysis of the quality of fit of the stochastic
block model (SBM) for 275 empirical networks spanning a wide range of domains
and orders of size magnitude. We employ posterior predictive model checking as
a criterion to assess the quality of fit, which involves comparing networks
generated by the inferred model with the empirical network, according to a set
of network descriptors. We observe that the SBM is capable of providing an
accurate description for the majority of networks considered, but falls short
of saturating all modeling requirements. In particular, networks possessing a
large diameter and slow-mixing random walks tend to be badly described by the
SBM. However, contrary to what is often assumed, networks with a high abundance
of triangles can be well described by the SBM in many cases. We demonstrate
that simple network descriptors can be used to evaluate whether or not the SBM
can provide a sufficiently accurate representation, potentially pointing to
possible model extensions that can systematically improve the expressiveness of
this class of models.</span>

                    <span>In binary classification, imbalance refers to situations in which one class
is heavily under-represented. This issue is due to either a data collection
process or because one class is indeed rare in a population. Imbalanced
classification frequently arises in applications such as biology, medicine,
engineering, and social sciences. In this paper, for the first time, we
theoretically study the impact of imbalance class sizes on the linear
discriminant analysis (LDA) in high dimensions. We show that due to data
scarcity in one class, referred to as the minority class, and
high-dimensionality of the feature space, the LDA ignores the minority class
yielding a maximum misclassification rate. We then propose a new construction
of hard-thresholding rules based on a data splitting technique that reduces the
large difference between the misclassification rates. We show that the proposed
method is asymptotically optimal. We further study two well-known sparse
versions of the LDA in imbalanced cases. We evaluate the finite-sample
performance of different methods using simulations and by analyzing two real
data sets. The results show that our method either outperforms its competitors
or has comparable performance based on a much smaller subset of selected
features, while being computationally more efficient.</span>

                    <span>The machine learning (ML) life cycle involves a series of iterative steps,
from the effective gathering and preparation of the data, including complex
feature engineering processes, to the presentation and improvement of results,
with various algorithms to choose from in every step. Feature engineering in
particular can be very beneficial for ML, leading to numerous improvements such
as boosting the predictive results, decreasing computational times, reducing
excessive noise, and increasing the transparency behind the decisions taken
during the training. Despite that, while several visual analytics tools exist
to monitor and control the different stages of the ML life cycle (especially
those related to data and algorithms), feature engineering support remains
inadequate. In this paper, we present FeatureEnVi, a visual analytics system
specifically designed to assist with the feature engineering process. Our
proposed system helps users to choose the most important feature, to transform
the original features into powerful alternatives, and to experiment with
different feature generation combinations. Additionally, data space slicing
allows users to explore the impact of features on both local and global scales.
FeatureEnVi utilizes multiple automatic feature selection techniques;
furthermore, it visually guides users with statistical evidence about the
influence of each feature (or subsets of features). The final outcome is the
extraction of heavily engineered features, evaluated by multiple validation
metrics. The usefulness and applicability of FeatureEnVi are demonstrated with
two use cases and a case study. We also report feedback from interviews with
two ML experts and a visualization researcher who assessed the effectiveness of
our system.</span>

                    <span>Modern kernel-based two-sample tests have shown great success in
distinguishing complex, high-dimensional distributions with appropriate learned
kernels. Previous work has demonstrated that this kernel learning procedure
succeeds, assuming a considerable number of observed samples from each
distribution. In realistic scenarios with very limited numbers of data samples,
however, it can be challenging to identify a kernel powerful enough to
distinguish complex distributions. We address this issue by introducing the
problem of meta two-sample testing (M2ST), which aims to exploit (abundant)
auxiliary data on related tasks to find an algorithm that can quickly identify
a powerful test on new target tasks. We propose two specific algorithms for
this task: a generic scheme which improves over baselines and a more tailored
approach which performs even better. We provide both theoretical justification
and empirical evidence that our proposed meta-testing schemes out-perform
learning kernel-based tests directly from scarce observations, and identify
when such schemes will be successful.</span>

                    <span>Machine learning models often encounter distribution shifts when deployed in
the real world. In this paper, we focus on adaptation to label distribution
shift in the online setting, where the test-time label distribution is
continually changing and the model must dynamically adapt to it without
observing the true label. Leveraging a novel analysis, we show that the lack of
true label does not hinder estimation of the expected test loss, which enables
the reduction of online label shift adaptation to conventional online learning.
Informed by this observation, we propose adaptation algorithms inspired by
classical online learning techniques such as Follow The Leader (FTL) and Online
Gradient Descent (OGD) and derive their regret bounds. We empirically verify
our findings under both simulated and real world label distribution shifts and
show that OGD is particularly effective and robust to a variety of challenging
label shift scenarios.</span>

                    <span>Feature selection, as a vital dimension reduction technique, reduces data
dimension by identifying an essential subset of input features, which can
facilitate interpretable insights into learning and inference processes.
Algorithmic stability is a key characteristic of an algorithm regarding its
sensitivity to perturbations of input samples. In this paper, we propose an
innovative unsupervised feature selection algorithm attaining this stability
with provable guarantees. The architecture of our algorithm consists of a
feature scorer and a feature selector. The scorer trains a neural network (NN)
to globally score all the features, and the selector adopts a dependent sub-NN
to locally evaluate the representation abilities for selecting features.
Further, we present algorithmic stability analysis and show that our algorithm
has a performance guarantee via a generalization error bound. Extensive
experimental results on real-world datasets demonstrate superior generalization
performance of our proposed algorithm to strong baseline methods. Also, the
properties revealed by our theoretical analysis and the stability of our
algorithm-selected features are empirically confirmed.</span>

the opportunities we have access to. Current audits for fairness are limited to
coarse-grained parity assessments at the level of sensitive groups. We propose
to audit for envy-freeness, a more granular criterion aligned with individual
preferences: every user should prefer their recommendations to those of other
users. Since auditing for envy requires to estimate the preferences of users
beyond their existing recommendations, we cast the audit as a new pure

Federated Learning (OARF), a benchmark suite for federated machine learning
systems. Previously available benchmarks for federated learning have focused
mainly on synthetic datasets and use a limited number of applications. OARF
mimics more realistic application scenarios with publicly available data sets
as different data silos in image, text and structured data. Our

                    <span>Generative adversarial networks (GANs) with clustered latent spaces can
perform conditional generation in a completely unsupervised manner. In the real
world, the salient attributes of unlabeled data can be imbalanced. However,
most of existing unsupervised conditional GANs cannot cluster attributes of
these data in their latent spaces properly because they assume uniform
distributions of the attributes. To address this problem, we theoretically
derive Stein latent optimization that provides reparameterizable gradient
estimations of the latent distribution parameters assuming a Gaussian mixture
prior in a continuous latent space. Structurally, we introduce an encoder
network and novel unsupervised conditional contrastive loss to ensure that data
generated from a single mixture component represent a single attribute. We
confirm that the proposed method, named Stein Latent Optimization for GANs
(SLOGAN), successfully learns balanced or imbalanced attributes and achieves
state-of-the-art unsupervised conditional generation performance even in the
absence of attribute information (e.g., the imbalance ratio). Moreover, we
demonstrate that the attributes to be learned can be manipulated using a small
amount of probe data.</span>

                    <span>We consider a matrix completion problem that exploits social or item
similarity graphs as side information. We develop a universal, parameter-free,
and computationally efficient algorithm that starts with hierarchical graph
clustering and then iteratively refines estimates both on graph clustering and
matrix ratings. Under a hierarchical stochastic block model that well respects
practically-relevant social graphs and a low-rank rating matrix model (to be
detailed), we demonstrate that our algorithm achieves the information-theoretic
limit on the number of observed matrix entries (i.e., optimal sample
complexity) that is derived by maximum likelihood estimation together with a
lower-bound impossibility result. One consequence of this result is that
exploiting the hierarchical structure of social graphs yields a substantial
gain in sample complexity relative to the one that simply identifies different
groups without resorting to the relational structure across them. We conduct
extensive experiments both on synthetic and real-world datasets to corroborate
our theoretical results as well as to demonstrate significant performance
improvements over other matrix completion algorithms that leverage graph side
information.</span>

                    <span>A common approach to solving tasks, such as node classification or link
prediction, on a large network begins by learning a Euclidean embedding of the
nodes of the network, from which regular machine learning methods can be
applied. For unsupervised random walk methods such as DeepWalk and node2vec,
adding a $\ell_2$ penalty on the embedding vectors to the loss leads to
improved downstream task performance. In this paper we study the effects of
this regularization and prove that, under exchangeability assumptions on the
graph, it asymptotically leads to learning a nuclear-norm-type penalized
graphon. In particular, the exact form of the penalty depends on the choice of
subsampling method used within stochastic gradient descent to learn the
embeddings. We also illustrate empirically that concatenating node covariates
to $\ell_2$ regularized node2vec embeddings leads to comparable, if not
superior, performance to methods which incorporate node covariates and the
network structure in a non-linear manner.</span>

                    <span>The covariance structure of multivariate functional data can be highly
complex, especially if the multivariate dimension is large, making extensions
of statistical methods for standard multivariate data to the functional data
setting challenging. For example, Gaussian graphical models have recently been
extended to the setting of multivariate functional data by applying
multivariate methods to the coefficients of truncated basis expansions.
However, a key difficulty compared to multivariate data is that the covariance
operator is compact, and thus not invertible. The methodology in this paper
addresses the general problem of covariance modeling for multivariate
functional data, and functional Gaussian graphical models in particular. As a
first step, a new notion of separability for the covariance operator of
multivariate functional data is proposed, termed partial separability, leading
to a novel Karhunen-Lo\&#x60;eve-type expansion for such data. Next, the partial
separability structure is shown to be particularly useful in order to provide a
well-defined functional Gaussian graphical model that can be identified with a
sequence of finite-dimensional graphical models, each of identical fixed
dimension. This motivates a simple and efficient estimation procedure through
application of the joint graphical lasso. Empirical performance of the method
for graphical model estimation is assessed through simulation and analysis of
functional brain connectivity during a motor task. %Empirical performance of

prediction is also fundamental for operation and advanced information systems.
A variety of solutions exist for short-term travel time predictions such as
solutions that utilize real-time GPS data and optimization methods to track the
path of a vehicle. However, reliable long-term predictions remain challenging.
We show in this paper the applicability and usefulness of travel time i.e.
delivery time prediction for postal services. We investigate several methods
such as linear regression models and tree based ensembles such as random
forest, bagging, and boosting, that allow to predict delivery time by
conducting extensive experiments and considering many usability scenarios.
Results reveal that travel time prediction can help mitigate high delays in

                    <span>Neural networks are known to be vulnerable to adversarial attacks -- slight
but carefully constructed perturbations of the inputs which can drastically
impair the network&#x27;s performance. Many defense methods have been proposed for
improving robustness of deep networks by training them on adversarially
perturbed inputs. However, these models often remain vulnerable to new types of
attacks not seen during training, and even to slightly stronger versions of
previously seen attacks. In this work, we propose a novel approach to
adversarial robustness, which builds upon the insights from the domain
adaptation field. Our method, called Adversarial Feature Desensitization (AFD),
aims at learning features that are invariant towards adversarial perturbations
of the inputs. This is achieved through a game where we learn features that are
both predictive and robust (insensitive to adversarial attacks), i.e. cannot be
used to discriminate between natural and adversarial data. Empirical results on
several benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach
against a wide range of attack types and attack strengths. Our code is

                    <span>This paper presents local minimax regret lower bounds for adaptively
controlling linear-quadratic-Gaussian (LQG) systems. We consider smoothly
parametrized instances and provide an understanding of when logarithmic regret
is impossible which is both instance specific and flexible enough to take
problem structure into account. This understanding relies on two key notions:
That of local-uninformativeness; when the optimal policy does not provide
sufficient excitation for identification of the optimal policy, and yields a
degenerate Fisher information matrix; and that of
information-regret-boundedness, when the small eigenvalues of a
policy-dependent information matrix are boundable in terms of the regret of
that policy. Combined with a reduction to Bayesian estimation and application
of Van Trees&#x27; inequality, these two conditions are sufficient for proving
regret bounds on order of magnitude $\sqrt{T}$ in the time horizon, $T$. This
method yields lower bounds that exhibit tight dimensional dependencies and
scale naturally with control-theoretic problem constants. For instance, we are
able to prove that systems operating near marginal stability are fundamentally
hard to learn to control. We further show that large classes of systems satisfy
these conditions, among them any state-feedback system with both $A$- and
$B$-matrices unknown. Most importantly, we also establish that a nontrivial
class of partially observable systems, essentially those that are
over-actuated, satisfy these conditions, thus providing a $\sqrt{T}$ lower
bound also valid for partially observable systems. Finally, we turn to two
simple examples which demonstrate that our lower bound captures classical
control-theoretic intuition: our lower bounds diverge for systems operating
near marginal stability or with large filter gain -- these can be arbitrarily
hard to (learn to) control.</span>

                    <span>Entropy coding is the backbone data compression. Novel machine-learning based
compression methods often use a new entropy coder called Asymmetric Numeral
Systems (ANS) [Duda et al., 2015], which provides very close to optimal
bitrates and simplifies [Townsend et al., 2019] advanced compression techniques
such as bits-back coding. However, researchers with a background in machine
learning often struggle to understand how ANS works, which prevents them from
exploiting its full versatility. This paper is meant as an educational resource
to make ANS more approachable by presenting it from a new perspective of latent
variable models and the so-called bits-back trick. We guide the reader step by
step to a complete implementation of ANS in the Python programming language,
which we then generalize for more advanced use cases. We also present and
empirically evaluate an open-source library of various entropy coders designed
for both research and production use. Related teaching videos and problem sets
are available online.</span>

                    <span>Recent advances in counter-adversarial systems have garnered significant
research interest in inverse filtering from a Bayesian perspective. For
example, interest in estimating the adversary&#x27;s Kalman filter tracked estimate
with the purpose of predicting the adversary&#x27;s future steps has led to recent
formulations of inverse Kalman filter (I-KF). In this context of inverse
filtering, we address the key challenges of nonlinear process dynamics and
unknown input to the forward filter by proposing inverse extended Kalman filter
(I-EKF). We derive I-EKF with and without an unknown input by considering
nonlinearity in both forward and inverse state-space models. In the process,
I-KF-with-unknown-input is also obtained. We then provide theoretical stability
guarantees using both bounded nonlinearity and unknown matrix approaches. We
further generalize these formulations and results to the case of higher-order,
Gaussian-sum, and dithered I-EKFs. Numerical experiments validate our methods
for various proposed inverse filters using the recursive Cram\&#x27;er-Rao lower
bound as a benchmark.</span>

                    <span>Stochastic majorization-minimization (SMM) is an online extension of the
classical principle of majorization-minimization, which consists of sampling
i.i.d. data points from a fixed data distribution and minimizing a recursively
defined majorizing surrogate of an objective function. In this paper, we
introduce stochastic block majorization-minimization, where the surrogates can
now be only block multi-convex and a single block is optimized at a time within
a diminishing radius. Relaxing the standard strong convexity requirements for
surrogates in SMM, our framework gives wider applicability including online
CANDECOMP/PARAFAC (CP) dictionary learning and yields greater computational
efficiency especially when the problem dimension is large. We provide an
extensive convergence analysis on the proposed algorithm, which we derive under
possibly dependent data streams, relaxing the standard i.i.d. assumption on
data samples. We show that the proposed algorithm converges almost surely to
the set of stationary points of a nonconvex objective under constraints at a
rate $O((\log n)^{1+\eps}/n^{1/2})$ for the empirical loss function and
$O((\log n)^{1+\eps}/n^{1/4})$ for the expected loss function, where $n$
denotes the number of data samples processed. Under some additional assumption,
the latter convergence rate can be improved to $O((\log n)^{1+\eps}/n^{1/2})$.
Our results provide first convergence rate bounds for various online matrix and
tensor decomposition algorithms under a general Markovian data setting.</span>

                    <span>The goal of NAS is to find an optimal architecture of a neural network for a given problem. In my case, I am interested in creating an algorithm for finding the architecture of a Convolutional Neural Network for an Image dataset.
 The problem with any NAS algorithm is that the only true way to know if a created architecture is good is by running the model to convergence, thus increasing computational resources spent.
 There have been many possible solutions to gauge the relative trained accuracy of model. The most popular is to simply reduce the dataset, reuse training weights, and/or train for only a couple of iterations.
 I was wanting to hear some thoughts...
 I can save computational resources by only training each possible model for only 3 iterations and gauge its success using its training accuracy. The problem however with using training accuracy is that it does not gauge how well the model will generalize, only if it is capable of learning anything from the training data, if not overfitting. The problem with using the validation accuracy after 3 iterations is that most models have extremely poor validation accuracy scores early on during training, only catching up around iteration 10, therefore in order to fully gauged the validation accuracy the models would have to be trained until iteration 10, 3x more than using the training accuracy after 3 iterations.
 Would you rather train the models for only 3 iterations, using training accuracy as the metric to compare models, risking the models overfitting when trained until convergence; or, would you rather play the safe game and train models for 10 iterations using validation accuracy as a metric to compare models, but spend 3x the amount of computational resources?

                    <span>There has been a lot of recent work on model calibration — ensuring a match between a model’s confidence and correctness.
 This seems critical in applications where confidence/safety matters (e.g. perception related parts of self-driving), but I’m curious whether model calibration is something important for industry practitioners.

                    <span>I posted here a while ago about a website I created that aggregates competitions across Kaggle and other websites: https://mlcontests.com (open source and community maintained - GitHub link at the bottom of the page)
 https://preview.redd.it/7poem4aqmaa81.png?width&#x3D;1100&amp;format&#x3D;png&amp;auto&#x3D;webp&amp;s&#x3D;362666ed2bec33d88cdb2c03b84371891e29a928
 Based on some feedback I implemented a few extra features, and today I launched a Discord community to go along with it - this allows people to find teammates to collaborate with on a competition, and to get real-time alerts when new competitions are launched. There are also a few team members from the competition platforms in the Discord already.

 Also welcome is discussion about ongoing competitions, and post-mortems/debriefs after competitions end. If this sounds interesting to you, you can join the Discord here: https://discord.com/invite/nM482gc9h8
 Hope to see you there!

                    <span>In the domain of uncertainty estimation in places like segmentation, MC Dropout is used as an approximation of Bayesian computations. I&#x27;ve seen a thread from a few years ago talking about its issues and I&#x27;ve just read this recent paper called Is MC Dropout Bayesian?, and they conclude it isn&#x27;t.
 They propose a new method for parametric VI based on the reparametrization trick and stochastic backpropagation, but my maths isn&#x27;t good enough to fully understand it. 
 Does anyone have any thoughts on this? I find it a little strange that every uncertainty estimation paper in segmentation just uses MC Dropout as a default, with just a throwaway line that it is &quot;approximately Bayesian&quot;, even though it isn&#x27;t!

 Code:https://github.com/Oneflow-Inc/oneflow/
 In a previous article, we discussed OneFlow’s techniques for optimizing the Softmax CUDA Kernel. The performance of the OneFlow-optimized Softmax greatly exceeds that of the Softmax of CuDNN, and OneFlow also fully optimizes half types that many frameworks do not take into account.
 Here, we share OneFlow’s approach for optimizing the performance of another important operator, LayerNorm.

                    <span>Hello,
 I recently came across neuro-symbolic ai, and the concept looked really cool. However, except for a 2-3 papers from IBM-MIT research and a couple of blogs, I couldn’t find any work in this direction. 
  
Apart from VQA, what kind of potential domains can NS be applied to?
 Are there any caveats I am not aware of as to why not many from the community are not working in this direction?
  
Thank you!

                    <span>Hello, I have an issue with the training of a GAN, which consists of a generator and two discriminators, each discriminator working on one specific domain (i.e. time domain and time-frequency domain).
 The generator is used to generate waveforms, provided other waveforms (i.e. noisy waveform to de-noised waveform).
 ​
 The whole GAN is trained in the following way:
 1-The generator is independently pre-trained by regression, until validation losses reach a plateau.
 2-The two randomly initialized discriminators are then activated, and GANs training takes place.
 ​
 The output of step 1. is a raw version of the desired output.
 However, step 2 inititially degrades the output of the generator, by removing too much information. This is also reflected in all the validation losses, whose values…</span>

 Anyone take Datacamp courses and do projects?
 So quite a lot of projects and courses actually apply data preprocessing techniques before splitting data that encourage data leakage. 
 I can&#x27;t believe I paid for their services......
 Anyone catch other bad habits that Datacamp encourages? Aside from being a rather ineffective platform to learn?

                    <span>Hi!
 I am currently involved in a project that needs me to classify multimodal data - In which one modality is image. I went through many papers on the topic and most of them just seem to choose a random pretrained architecture for the same - VGG19 being the most common. I found little to no reason for the same except for the performance being better than other models.
 So basically, I want to know whether there is a way to choose the right model? And if not, which one out of Inception, VGG and ResNet are the best for binary image classification on a large scale? 
 Thanks!

                    <span>Hello, Currently I am learning NN algos, because I want to create a project, but during this time I got an idea for another project, I&#x27;m curious if its possible. Some of us have their favourite games of all times as do I, i.e. skyrim. And I got the second idea for the project. What if I created some kind of a &quot;chat bot&quot; that runs in the background in real time. It would allow player, to communicate with npcs with their own voice and ask them something that is not scripted in the game itself, but is &quot;lore friendly&quot;, by this I mean no questions about trump, biden or tiktok lol. Of course the second step would be to synthesize the voices of npcs for their generated dialogue. What I&#x27;d like to know is if that is possible, not only from proggramimg perspecitve(cuz anything given enough time would be completed), but is it possible for modern computers to run?
 It is just a crazy idea of a begginer lol

                    <span>Hi all, 
 I am trying to look at the code from a paper (https://github.com/anirudh9119/shared_workspace/tree/main/Triangle). I can code fluently and I know RL quite well in theory, the problem is I don&#x27;t have much hands-on experience yet. Perhaps this is why I get confused when looking at this repo, not because I don&#x27;t understand how the algorithm works, but because I can&#x27;t find the code for it. Specifically, I would like to take the code for this algorithm: 
 https://preview.redd.it/vip5wrq3p9a81.png?width&#x3D;957&amp;format&#x3D;png&amp;auto&#x3D;webp&amp;s&#x3D;4735929cbbd651d1d26dcbdfcb33b2a99be28c16
 Naively, I would expect to see one file with all the classes and functions needed for this agent, and then another file with the agent imported and the reinforcement learning task performed in a certain environment. Instead, in this repo there are so many files with so many classes and so many functions, that I get lost and I can&#x27;t identify which code refers to this algorithm. I can&#x27;t see where the agent is, I can&#x27;t see where the task is performed and so on. 
 I don&#x27;t understand if the repo is actually messy, or if it&#x27;s just due to the fact that I&#x27;m not interpreting it in the right way. 
 Thanks!

                    <span>I’m working on a project where my robotic arm should trace a hand written letter. For me to show that my arm is indeed tracing out the letter it would be better if I can draw a line as the end effector moves. Does anyone know how can I do that?

                    <span>Hello everyone,
 I am currently using a PPO implementation (using pytorch) that has the actor and critic networks defined under one class (Class ActorCritic(nn.Module)), where each network is defined using nn.sequential (self.actor &#x3D; nn.sequential ... and self.critic&#x3D;nn.sequential).
 Is there a way to define both networks in the same class but using the forward method instead of nn.sequential?

                    <span>The neural network-based approach to solving partial differential equations
has attracted considerable attention due to its simplicity and flexibility in
representing the solution of the partial differential equation. In training a
neural network, the network learns global features corresponding to
low-frequency components while high-frequency components are approximated at a
much slower rate. For a class of equations in which the solution contains a
wide range of scales, the network training process can suffer from slow
convergence and low accuracy due to its inability to capture the high-frequency
components. In this work, we propose a hierarchical approach to improve the
convergence rate and accuracy of the neural network solution to partial
differential equations. The proposed method comprises multi-training levels in
which a newly introduced neural network is guided to learn the residual of the
previous level approximation. By the nature of neural networks&#x27; training
process, the high-level correction is inclined to capture the high-frequency
components. We validate the efficiency and robustness of the proposed
hierarchical approach through a suite of linear and nonlinear partial
differential equations.</span>

                    <span>In computer vision and natural language processing, innovations in model
architecture that increase model capacity have reliably translated into gains
in performance. In stark contrast with this trend, state-of-the-art
reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms often use small MLPs, and gains in
performance typically originate from algorithmic innovations. It is natural to
hypothesize that small datasets in RL necessitate simple models to avoid
overfitting; however, this hypothesis is untested. In this paper we investigate
how RL agents are affected by exchanging the small MLPs with larger modern
networks with skip connections and normalization, focusing specifically on
actor-critic algorithms. We empirically verify that naively adopting such
architectures leads to instabilities and poor performance, likely contributing
to the popularity of simple models in practice. However, we show that dataset
size is not the limiting factor, and instead argue that instability from taking
gradients through the critic is the culprit. We demonstrate that spectral
normalization (SN) can mitigate this issue and enable stable training with
large modern architectures. After smoothing with SN, larger models yield
significant performance improvements -- suggesting that more &quot;easy&quot; gains may
be had by focusing on model architectures in addition to algorithmic
innovations.</span>

                    <span>Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) is one promising approach to teaching
robots to perform complex tasks. Because methods that directly reuse the stored
experience data cannot follow the change of the environment in robotic problems
with a time-varying environment, online DRL is required. The eligibility traces
method is well known as an online learning technique for improving sample
efficiency in traditional reinforcement learning with linear regressors rather
than DRL. The dependency between parameters of deep neural networks would
destroy the eligibility traces, which is why they are not integrated with DRL.
Although replacing the gradient with the most influential one rather than
accumulating the gradients as the eligibility traces can alleviate this
problem, the replacing operation reduces the number of reuses of previous
experiences. To address these issues, this study proposes a new eligibility
traces method that can be used even in DRL while maintaining high sample
efficiency. When the accumulated gradients differ from those computed using the
latest parameters, the proposed method takes into account the divergence
between the past and latest parameters to adaptively decay the eligibility
traces. Bregman divergences between outputs computed by the past and latest
parameters are exploited due to the infeasible computational cost of the
divergence between the past and latest parameters. In addition, a generalized
method with multiple time-scale traces is designed for the first time. This
design allows for the replacement of the most influential adaptively
accumulated (decayed) eligibility traces.</span>

                    <span>Dynamic objects have a significant impact on the robot&#x27;s perception of the
environment which degrades the performance of essential tasks such as
localization and mapping. In this work, we address this problem by synthesizing
plausible color, texture and geometry in regions occluded by dynamic objects.
We propose the novel geometry-aware DynaFill architecture that follows a
coarse-to-fine topology and incorporates our gated recurrent feedback mechanism
to adaptively fuse information from previous timesteps. We optimize our
architecture using adversarial training to synthesize fine realistic textures
which enables it to hallucinate color and depth structure in occluded regions
online in a spatially and temporally coherent manner, without relying on future
frame information. Casting our inpainting problem as an image-to-image
translation task, our model also corrects regions correlated with the presence
of dynamic objects in the scene, such as shadows or reflections. We introduce a
large-scale hyperrealistic dataset with RGB-D images, semantic segmentation
labels, camera poses as well as groundtruth RGB-D information of occluded
regions. Extensive quantitative and qualitative evaluations show that our
approach achieves state-of-the-art performance, even in challenging weather
conditions. Furthermore, we present results for retrieval-based visual
localization with the synthesized images that demonstrate the utility of our
approach.</span>

                    <span>Over the past several years, legal applications of deep learning have been on
the rise. However, as with other high-stakes decision making areas, the
requirement for interpretability is of crucial importance. Current models
utilized by legal practitioners are more of the conventional machine learning
type, wherein they are inherently interpretable, yet unable to harness the
performance capabilities of data-driven deep learning models. In this work, we
utilize deep learning models in the area of trademark law to shed light on the
issue of likelihood of confusion between trademarks. Specifically, we introduce
a model-agnostic interpretable intermediate layer, a technique which proves to
be effective for legal documents. Furthermore, we utilize weakly supervised
learning by means of a curriculum learning strategy, effectively demonstrating
the improved performance of a deep learning model. This is in contrast to the
conventional models which are only able to utilize the limited number of
expensive manually-annotated samples by legal experts. Although the methods
presented in this work tackles the task of risk of confusion for trademarks, it
is straightforward to extend them to other fields of law, or more generally, to
other similar high-stakes application scenarios.</span>

                    <span>In this paper, we address the problem of automatic repair of software
vulnerabilities with deep learning. The major problem with data-driven
vulnerability repair is that the few existing datasets of known confirmed
vulnerabilities consist of only a few thousand examples. However, training a
deep learning model often requires hundreds of thousands of examples. In this
work, we leverage the intuition that the bug fixing task and the vulnerability
fixing task are related and that the knowledge learned from bug fixes can be
transferred to fixing vulnerabilities. In the machine learning community, this
technique is called transfer learning. In this paper, we propose an approach
for repairing security vulnerabilities named VRepair which is based on transfer
learning. VRepair is first trained on a large bug fix corpus and is then tuned
on a vulnerability fix dataset, which is an order of magnitude smaller. In our
experiments, we show that a model trained only on a bug fix corpus can already
fix some vulnerabilities. Then, we demonstrate that transfer learning improves
the ability to repair vulnerable C functions. We also show that the transfer
learning model performs better than a model trained with a denoising task and
fine-tuned on the vulnerability fixing task. To sum up, this paper shows that
transfer learning works well for repairing security vulnerabilities in C
compared to learning on a small dataset.</span>

fuzzy membership function. An alternative conception of deep autoencoder,
referred to as \emph{Conditionally Deep Membership-Mapping Autoencoder

practice-oriented settings, an analytical solution for the learning of CDMMA
can be derived by means of variational optimization. The paper proposes a
transfer and multi-task learning approach that combines CDMMA with a tailored

                    <span>Although Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have shown incredible performance in
perceptive and control tasks, several trustworthy issues are still open. One of
the most discussed topics is the existence of adversarial perturbations, which
has opened an interesting research line on provable techniques capable of
quantifying the robustness of a given input. In this regard, the Euclidean
distance of the input from the classification boundary denotes a well-proved
robustness assessment as the minimal affordable adversarial perturbation.
Unfortunately, computing such a distance is highly complex due the non-convex
nature of NNs. Despite several methods have been proposed to address this
issue, to the best of our knowledge, no provable results have been presented to
estimate and bound the error committed. This paper addresses this issue by
proposing two lightweight strategies to find the minimal adversarial
perturbation. Differently from the state-of-the-art, the proposed approach
allows formulating an error estimation theory of the approximate distance with
respect to the theoretical one. Finally, a substantial set of experiments is
reported to evaluate the performance of the algorithms and support the
theoretical findings. The obtained results show that the proposed strategies
approximate the theoretical distance for samples close to the classification
boundary, leading to provable robustness guarantees against any adversarial
attacks.</span>

                    <span>Recent work has shown the potential of the use of audio data in screening for
COVID-19. However, very little exploration has been done of monitoring disease
progression, especially recovery in COVID-19 through audio. Tracking disease
progression characteristics and patterns of recovery could lead to tremendous
insights and more timely treatment or treatment adjustment, as well as better
resources management in health care systems.

The primary objective of this study is to explore the potential of
longitudinal audio dynamics for COVID-19 monitoring using sequential deep
learning techniques, focusing on prediction of disease progression and,
especially, recovery trend prediction. We analysed crowdsourced respiratory
audio data from 212 individuals over 5 days to 385 days, alongside their
self-reported COVID-19 test results. We first explore the benefits of capturing
longitudinal dynamics of audio biomarkers for COVID-19 detection. The strong
performance, yielding an AUC-ROC of 0.79, sensitivity of 0.75 and specificity
of 0.70, supports the effectiveness of the approach compared to methods that do
not leverage longitudinal dynamics. We further examine the predicted disease
progression trajectory, which displays high consistency with the longitudinal
test results with a correlation of 0.76 in the test cohort, and 0.86 in a
subset of the test cohort with 12 participants who report disease recovery.

Our findings suggest that monitoring COVID-19 progression via longitudinal
audio data has enormous potential in the tracking of individuals&#x27; disease
progression and recovery.</span>

                    <span>The Sliced-Wasserstein distance (SW) is being increasingly used in machine
learning applications as an alternative to the Wasserstein distance and offers
significant computational and statistical benefits. Since it is defined as an
expectation over random projections, SW is commonly approximated by Monte
Carlo. We adopt a new perspective to approximate SW by making use of the
concentration of measure phenomenon: under mild assumptions, one-dimensional
projections of a high-dimensional random vector are approximately Gaussian.
Based on this observation, we develop a simple deterministic approximation for
SW. Our method does not require sampling a number of random projections, and is
therefore both accurate and easy to use compared to the usual Monte Carlo
approximation. We derive nonasymptotical guarantees for our approach, and show
that the approximation error goes to zero as the dimension increases, under a
weak dependence condition on the data distribution. We validate our theoretical
findings on synthetic datasets, and illustrate the proposed approximation on a
generative modeling problem.</span>

                    <span>A novel instance-based method for the classification of
electroencephalography (EEG) signals is presented and evaluated in this paper.
The non-stationary nature of the EEG signals, coupled with the demanding task
of pattern recognition with limited training data as well as the potentially
noisy signal acquisition conditions, have motivated the work reported in this
study. The proposed adaptive template enhancement mechanism transforms the
feature-level instances by treating each feature dimension separately, hence
resulting in improved class separation and better query-class matching. The
proposed new instance-based learning algorithm is compared with a few related
algorithms in a number of scenarios. A clinical grade 64-electrode EEG
database, as well as a low-quality (high-noise level) EEG database obtained
with a low-cost system using a single dry sensor have been used for evaluations
in biometric person recognition. The proposed approach demonstrates
significantly improved classification accuracy in both identification and
verification scenarios. In particular, this new method is seen to provide a
good classification performance for noisy EEG data, indicating its potential
suitability for a wide range of applications.</span>

                    <span>Machine learning (ML) has been pervasively researched nowadays and it has
been applied in many aspects of real life. Nevertheless, issues of model and
data still accompany the development of ML. For instance, training of
traditional ML models is limited to the access of data sets, which are
generally proprietary; published ML models may soon be out of date without
update of new data and continuous training; malicious data contributors may
upload wrongly labeled data that leads to undesirable training results; and the
abuse of private data and data leakage also exit. With the utilization of
blockchain, an emerging and swiftly developing technology, these problems can
be efficiently solved. In this paper, we conduct a survey of the convergence of
collaborative ML and blockchain. We investigate different ways of combination
of these two technologies, and their fields of application. We also discuss the
limitations of current research and their future directions.</span>

                    <span>Machine learning models may involve decision boundaries that change over time
due to updates to rules and regulations, such as in loan approvals or claims
management. However, in such scenarios, it may take time for sufficient
training data to accumulate in order to retrain the model to reflect the new
decision boundaries. While work has been done to reinforce existing decision
boundaries, very little has been done to cover these scenarios where decision
boundaries of the ML models should change in order to reflect new rules. In
this paper, we focus on user-provided feedback rules as a way to expedite the
ML models update process, and we formally introduce the problem of
pre-processing training data to edit an ML model in response to feedback rules
such that once the model is retrained on the pre-processed data, its decision
boundaries align more closely with the rules. To solve this problem, we propose
a novel data augmentation method, the Feedback Rule-Based Oversampling
Technique. Extensive experiments using different ML models and real world
datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the method, in particular the benefit
of augmentation and the ability to handle many feedback rules.</span>

                    <span>Understanding how the predictions of deep learning models are formed during
the training process is crucial to improve model performance and fix model
defects, especially when we need to investigate nontrivial training strategies
such as active learning, and track the root cause of unexpected training
results such as performance degeneration.

In this work, we propose a time-travelling visual solution DeepVisualInsight
(DVI), aiming to manifest the spatio-temporal causality while training a deep
learning image classifier. The spatio-temporal causality demonstrates how the
gradient-descent algorithm and various training data sampling techniques can
influence and reshape the layout of learnt input representation and the
classification boundaries in consecutive epochs. Such causality allows us to
observe and analyze the whole learning process in the visible low dimensional
space. Technically, we propose four spatial and temporal properties and design
our visualization solution to satisfy them. These properties preserve the most
important information when inverse-)projecting input samples between the
visible low-dimensional and the invisible high-dimensional space, for causal
analyses. Our extensive experiments show that, comparing to baseline
approaches, we achieve the best visualization performance regarding the
spatial/temporal properties and visualization efficiency. Moreover, our case
study shows that our visual solution can well reflect the characteristics of
various training scenarios, showing good potential of DVI as a debugging tool
for analyzing deep learning training processes.</span>

                    <span>Finding different solutions to the same problem is a key aspect of
intelligence associated with creativity and adaptation to novel situations. In
reinforcement learning, a set of diverse policies can be useful for
exploration, transfer, hierarchy, and robustness. We propose Diverse Successive
Policies, a method for discovering policies that are diverse in the space of
Successor Features, while assuring that they are near optimal. We formalize the
problem as a Constrained Markov Decision Process (CMDP) where the goal is to
find policies that maximize diversity, characterized by an intrinsic diversity
reward, while remaining near-optimal with respect to the extrinsic reward of
the MDP. We also analyze how recently proposed robustness and discrimination
rewards perform and find that they are sensitive to the initialization of the
procedure and may converge to sub-optimal solutions. To alleviate this, we
propose new explicit diversity rewards that aim to minimize the correlation
between the Successor Features of the policies in the set. We compare the
different diversity mechanisms in the DeepMind Control Suite and find that the
type of explicit diversity we are proposing is important to discover distinct
behavior, like for example different locomotion patterns.</span>

                    <span>The effect of bias on hypothesis formation is characterized for an automated
data-driven projection pursuit neural network to extract and select features
for binary classification of data streams. This intelligent exploratory process
partitions a complete vector state space into disjoint subspaces to create
working hypotheses quantified by similarities and differences observed between
two groups of labeled data streams. Data streams are typically time sequenced,
and may exhibit complex spatio-temporal patterns. For example, given atomic
trajectories from molecular dynamics simulation, the machine&#x27;s task is to
quantify dynamical mechanisms that promote function by comparing protein
mutants, some known to function while others are nonfunctional. Utilizing
synthetic two-dimensional molecules that mimic the dynamics of functional and
nonfunctional proteins, biases are identified and controlled in both the
machine learning model and selected training data under different contexts. The
refinement of a working hypothesis converges to a statistically robust
multivariate perception of the data based on a context-dependent perspective.
Including diverse perspectives during data exploration enhances
interpretability of the multivariate characterization of similarities and
differences.</span>

                    <span>A variety of modern applications exhibit multi-view multi-label learning,
where each sample has multi-view features, and multiple labels are correlated
via common views. In recent years, several methods have been proposed to cope
with it and achieve much success, but still suffer from two key problems: 1)
lack the ability to deal with the incomplete multi-view weak-label data, in
which only a subset of features and labels are provided for each sample; 2)
ignore the presence of noisy views and tail labels usually occurring in
real-world problems. In this paper, we propose a novel method, named CEMENT, to
overcome the limitations. For 1), CEMENT jointly embeds incomplete views and
weak labels into distinct low-dimensional subspaces, and then correlates them
via Hilbert-Schmidt Independence Criterion (HSIC). For 2), CEMEMT adaptively
learns the weights of embeddings to capture noisy views, and explores an
additional sparse component to model tail labels, making the low-rankness
available in the multi-label setting. We develop an alternating algorithm to
solve the proposed optimization problem. Experimental results on seven
real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.</span>

                    <span>Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder which results
in altered behavior, social development, and communication patterns. In past
years, autism prevalence has tripled, with 1 in 54 children now affected. Given
that traditional diagnosis is a lengthy, labor-intensive process, significant
attention has been given to developing systems that automatically screen for
autism. Prosody abnormalities are among the clearest signs of autism, with
affected children displaying speech idiosyncrasies including echolalia,
monotonous intonation, atypical pitch, and irregular linguistic stress
patterns. In this work, we present a suite of machine learning approaches to
detect autism in self-recorded speech audio captured from autistic and
neurotypical (NT) children in home environments. We consider three methods to
detect autism in child speech: first, Random Forests trained on extracted audio
features (including Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients); second, convolutional
neural networks (CNNs) trained on spectrograms; and third, fine-tuned wav2vec
2.0--a state-of-the-art Transformer-based ASR model. We train our classifiers
on our novel dataset of cellphone-recorded child speech audio curated from
Stanford&#x27;s Guess What? mobile game, an app designed to crowdsource videos of
autistic and neurotypical children in a natural home environment. The Random
Forest classifier achieves 70% accuracy, the fine-tuned wav2vec 2.0 model
achieves 77% accuracy, and the CNN achieves 79% accuracy when classifying
children&#x27;s audio as either ASD or NT. Our models were able to predict autism
status when training on a varied selection of home audio clips with
inconsistent recording quality, which may be more generalizable to real world
conditions. These results demonstrate that machine learning methods offer
promise in detecting autism automatically from speech without specialized
equipment.</span>

                    <span>Many online platforms today (such as Amazon, Netflix, Spotify, LinkedIn, and
AirBnB) can be thought of as two-sided markets with producers and customers of
goods and services. Traditionally, recommendation services in these platforms
have focused on maximizing customer satisfaction by tailoring the results
according to the personalized preferences of individual customers. However, our
investigation reinforces the fact that such customer-centric design of these
services may lead to unfair distribution of exposure to the producers, which
may adversely impact their well-being. On the other hand, a pure
producer-centric design might become unfair to the customers. As more and more
people are depending on such platforms to earn a living, it is important to
ensure fairness to both producers and customers. In this work, by mapping a
fair personalized recommendation problem to a constrained version of the
problem of fairly allocating indivisible goods, we propose to provide fairness
guarantees for both sides. Formally, our proposed {\em FairRec} algorithm
guarantees Maxi-Min Share ($\alpha$-MMS) of exposure for the producers, and
Envy-Free up to One Item (EF1) fairness for the customers. Extensive
evaluations over multiple real-world datasets show the effectiveness of {\em
FairRec} in ensuring two-sided fairness while incurring a marginal loss in
overall recommendation quality. Finally, we present a modification of FairRec
(named as FairRecPlus) that at the cost of additional computation time,
improves the recommendation performance for the customers, while maintaining
the same fairness guarantees.</span>

                    <span>Since the proliferation of social media usage, hate speech has become a major
crisis. Hateful content can spread quickly and create an environment of
distress and hostility. Further, what can be considered hateful is contextual
and varies with time. While online hate speech reduces the ability of already
marginalised groups to participate in discussion freely, offline hate speech
leads to hate crimes and violence against individuals and communities. The
multifaceted nature of hate speech and its real-world impact have already
piqued the interest of the data mining and machine learning communities.
Despite our best efforts, hate speech remains an evasive issue for researchers
and practitioners alike. This article presents methodological challenges that
hinder building automated hate mitigation systems. These challenges inspired

                    <span>Prokaryotic viruses, which infect bacteria and archaea, are key players in
microbial communities. Predicting the hosts of prokaryotic viruses helps
decipher the dynamic relationship between microbes. Although there are
experimental methods for host identification, they are either labor-intensive
or require the cultivation of the host cells, creating a need for computational
host prediction. Despite some promising results, computational host prediction
remains a challenge because of the limited known interactions and the sheer
amount of sequenced phages by high-throughput sequencing technologies. The
state-of-the-art methods can only achieve 43% accuracy at the species level.
This work presents CHERRY, a tool formulating host prediction as link
prediction in a knowledge graph. As a virus-prokaryotic interaction prediction
tool, CHERRY can be applied to predict hosts for newly discovered viruses and
also the viruses infecting antibiotic-resistant bacteria. We demonstrated the
utility of CHERRY for both applications and compared its performance with the
state-of-the-art methods in different scenarios. To our best knowledge, CHERRY
has the highest accuracy in identifying virus-prokaryote interactions. It
outperforms all the existing methods at the species level with an accuracy
increase of 37%. In addition, CHERRY&#x27;s performance is more stable on short

leverages information from multiple modalities (textual, visual, and attribute

                    <span>While Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) algorithms, i.e., there are only
labeled data from source domains, have been actively studied in recent years,
most algorithms and theoretical results focus on Single-source Unsupervised
Domain Adaptation (SUDA). However, in the practical scenario, labeled data can
be typically collected from multiple diverse sources, and they might be
different not only from the target domain but also from each other. Thus,
domain adapters from multiple sources should not be modeled in the same way.
Recent deep learning based Multi-source Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (MUDA)
algorithms focus on extracting common domain-invariant representations for all
domains by aligning distribution of all pairs of source and target domains in a
common feature space. However, it is often very hard to extract the same
domain-invariant representations for all domains in MUDA. In addition, these
methods match distributions without considering domain-specific decision
boundaries between classes. To solve these problems, we propose a new framework
with two alignment stages for MUDA which not only respectively aligns the
distributions of each pair of source and target domains in multiple specific
feature spaces, but also aligns the outputs of classifiers by utilizing the
domain-specific decision boundaries. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
method can achieve remarkable results on popular benchmark datasets for image
classification.</span>

                    <span>Deployment of modern TinyML tasks on small battery-constrained IoT devices
requires high computational energy efficiency. Analog In-Memory Computing (IMC)
using non-volatile memory (NVM) promises major efficiency improvements in deep
neural network (DNN) inference and serves as on-chip memory storage for DNN
weights. However, IMC&#x27;s functional flexibility limitations and their impact on
performance, energy, and area efficiency are not yet fully understood at the
system level. To target practical end-to-end IoT applications, IMC arrays must
be enclosed in heterogeneous programmable systems, introducing new system-level
challenges which we aim at addressing in this work. We present a heterogeneous
tightly-coupled clustered architecture integrating 8 RISC-V cores, an in-memory
computing accelerator (IMA), and digital accelerators. We benchmark the system
on a highly heterogeneous workload such as the Bottleneck layer from a
MobileNetV2, showing 11.5x performance and 9.5x energy efficiency improvements,
compared to highly optimized parallel execution on the cores. Furthermore, we
explore the requirements for end-to-end inference of a full mobile-grade DNN
(MobileNetV2) in terms of IMC array resources, by scaling up our heterogeneous
architecture to a multi-array accelerator. Our results show that our solution,
on the end-to-end inference of the MobileNetV2, is one order of magnitude
better in terms of execution latency than existing programmable architectures
and two orders of magnitude better than state-of-the-art heterogeneous
solutions integrating in-memory computing analog cores.</span>

                    <span>Spectral-based graph neural networks (SGNNs) have been attracting increasing
attention in graph representation learning. However, existing SGNNs are limited
in implementing graph filters with rigid transforms (e.g., graph Fourier or
predefined graph wavelet transforms) and cannot adapt to signals residing on
graphs and tasks at hand. In this paper, we propose a novel class of graph
neural networks that realizes graph filters with adaptive graph wavelets.
Specifically, the adaptive graph wavelets are learned with neural
network-parameterized lifting structures, where structure-aware attention-based
lifting operations (i.e., prediction and update operations) are developed to
jointly consider graph structures and node features. We propose to lift based
on diffusion wavelets to alleviate the structural information loss induced by
partitioning non-bipartite graphs. By design, the locality and sparsity of the
resulting wavelet transform as well as the scalability of the lifting structure
are guaranteed. We further derive a soft-thresholding filtering operation by
learning sparse graph representations in terms of the learned wavelets,
yielding a localized, efficient, and scalable wavelet-based graph filters. To
ensure that the learned graph representations are invariant to node
permutations, a layer is employed at the input of the networks to reorder the
nodes according to their local topology information. We evaluate the proposed
networks in both node-level and graph-level representation learning tasks on
benchmark citation and bioinformatics graph datasets. Extensive experiments
demonstrate the superiority of the proposed networks over existing SGNNs in
terms of accuracy, efficiency, and scalability.</span>

                    <span>Recent data-extraction attacks have exposed that language models can memorize
some training samples verbatim. This is a vulnerability that can compromise the
privacy of the model&#x27;s training data. In this work, we introduce SubMix: a
practical protocol for private next-token prediction designed to prevent
privacy violations by language models that were fine-tuned on a private corpus
after pre-training on a public corpus. We show that SubMix limits the leakage
of information that is unique to any individual user in the private corpus via
a relaxation of group differentially private prediction. Importantly, SubMix
admits a tight, data-dependent privacy accounting mechanism, which allows it to
thwart existing data-extraction attacks while maintaining the utility of the
language model. SubMix is the first protocol that maintains privacy even when
publicly releasing tens of thousands of next-token predictions made by large
transformer-based models such as GPT-2.</span>

                    <span>It is fundamental for science and technology to be able to predict chemical
reactions and their properties. To achieve such skills, it is important to
develop good representations of chemical reactions, or good deep learning
architectures that can learn such representations automatically from the data.
There is currently no universal and widely adopted method for robustly
representing chemical reactions. Most existing methods suffer from one or more
drawbacks, such as: (1) lacking universality; (2) lacking robustness; (3)
lacking interpretability; or (4) requiring excessive manual pre-processing.
Here we exploit graph-based representations of molecular structures to develop
and test a hypergraph attention neural network approach to solve at once the
reaction representation and property-prediction problems, alleviating the
aforementioned drawbacks. We evaluate this hypergraph representation in three
experiments using three independent data sets of chemical reactions. In all
experiments, the hypergraph-based approach matches or outperforms other
representations and their corresponding models of chemical reactions while
yielding interpretable multi-level representations.</span>

                    <span>Real economies can be seen as a sequential imperfect-information game with
many heterogeneous, interacting strategic agents of various agent types, such
as consumers, firms, and governments. Dynamic general equilibrium models are
common economic tools to model the economic activity, interactions, and
outcomes in such systems. However, existing analytical and computational
methods struggle to find explicit equilibria when all agents are strategic and
interact, while joint learning is unstable and challenging. Amongst others, a
key reason is that the actions of one economic agent may change the reward
function of another agent, e.g., a consumer&#x27;s expendable income changes when
firms change prices or governments change taxes. We show that multi-agent deep
reinforcement learning (RL) can discover stable solutions that are epsilon-Nash
equilibria for a meta-game over agent types, in economic simulations with many
agents, through the use of structured learning curricula and efficient GPU-only
simulation and training. Conceptually, our approach is more flexible and does
not need unrealistic assumptions, e.g., market clearing, that are commonly used
for analytical tractability. Our GPU implementation enables training and
analyzing economies with a large number of agents within reasonable time
frames, e.g., training completes within a day. We demonstrate our approach in
real-business-cycle models, a representative family of DGE models, with 100
worker-consumers, 10 firms, and a government who taxes and redistributes. We
validate the learned meta-game epsilon-Nash equilibria through approximate
best-response analyses, show that RL policies align with economic intuitions,
and that our approach is constructive, e.g., by explicitly learning a spectrum
of meta-game epsilon-Nash equilibria in open RBC models.</span>

                    <span>Approximating wind flows using computational fluid dynamics (CFD) methods can
be time-consuming. Creating a tool for interactively designing prototypes while
observing the wind flow change requires simpler models to simulate faster.
Instead of running numerical approximations resulting in detailed calculations,
data-driven methods and deep learning might be able to give similar results in
a fraction of the time. This work rephrases the problem from computing 3D flow
fields using CFD to a 2D image-to-image translation-based problem on the
building footprints to predict the flow field at pedestrian height level. We
investigate the use of generative adversarial networks (GAN), such as Pix2Pix
[1] and CycleGAN [2] representing state-of-the-art for image-to-image
translation task in various domains as well as U-Net autoencoder [3]. The
models can learn the underlying distribution of a dataset in a data-driven
manner, which we argue can help the model learn the underlying
Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) equations from CFD. We experiment on
novel simulated datasets on various three-dimensional bluff-shaped buildings
with and without height information. Moreover, we present an extensive
qualitative and quantitative evaluation of the generated images for a selection
of models and compare their performance with the simulations delivered by CFD.
We then show that adding positional data to the input can produce more accurate
results by proposing a general framework for injecting such information on the
different architectures. Furthermore, we show that the models performances
improve by applying attention mechanisms and spectral normalization to
facilitate stable training.</span>

                    <span>In this work we use variational inference to quantify the degree of
uncertainty in deep learning model predictions of radio galaxy classification.
We show that the level of model posterior variance for individual test samples
is correlated with human uncertainty when labelling radio galaxies. We explore
the model performance and uncertainty calibration for a variety of different
weight priors and suggest that a sparse prior produces more well-calibrated
uncertainty estimates. Using the posterior distributions for individual
weights, we show that we can prune 30% of the fully-connected layer weights
without significant loss of performance by removing the weights with the lowest
signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). We demonstrate that a larger degree of pruning can
be achieved using a Fisher information based ranking, but we note that both
pruning methods affect the uncertainty calibration for Fanaroff-Riley type I
and type II radio galaxies differently. Finally we show that, like other work
in this field, we experience a cold posterior effect, whereby the posterior
must be down-weighted to achieve good predictive performance. We examine
whether adapting the cost function to accommodate model misspecification can
compensate for this effect, but find that it does not make a significant
difference. We also examine the effect of principled data augmentation and find
that this improves upon the baseline but also does not compensate for the
observed effect. We interpret this as the cold posterior effect being due to
the overly effective curation of our training sample leading to likelihood
misspecification, and raise this as a potential issue for Bayesian deep
learning approaches to radio galaxy classification in future.</span>

                    <span>Corrupted labels and class imbalance are commonly encountered in practically
collected training data, which easily leads to over-fitting of deep neural
networks (DNNs). Existing approaches alleviate these issues by adopting a
sample re-weighting strategy, which is to re-weight sample by designing
weighting function. However, it is only applicable for training data containing
only either one type of data biases. In practice, however, biased samples with
corrupted labels and of tailed classes commonly co-exist in training data. How
to handle them simultaneously is a key but under-explored problem. In this
paper, we find that these two types of biased samples, though have similar
transient loss, have distinguishable trend and characteristics in loss curves,
which could provide valuable priors for sample weight assignment. Motivated by
this, we delve into the loss curves and propose a novel probe-and-allocate
training strategy: In the probing stage, we train the network on the whole
biased training data without intervention, and record the loss curve of each
sample as an additional attribute; In the allocating stage, we feed the
resulting attribute to a newly designed curve-perception network, named
CurveNet, to learn to identify the bias type of each sample and assign proper
weights through meta-learning adaptively. The training speed of meta learning
also blocks its application. To solve it, we propose a method named skip layer
meta optimization (SLMO) to accelerate training speed by skipping the bottom
layers. Extensive synthetic and real experiments well validate the proposed
method, which achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple challenging
benchmarks.</span>

                    <span>Multimodal deep learning systems which employ multiple modalities like text,
image, audio, video, etc., are showing better performance in comparison with
individual modalities (i.e., unimodal) systems. Multimodal machine learning
involves multiple aspects: representation, translation, alignment, fusion, and
co-learning. In the current state of multimodal machine learning, the
assumptions are that all modalities are present, aligned, and noiseless during
training and testing time. However, in real-world tasks, typically, it is
observed that one or more modalities are missing, noisy, lacking annotated
data, have unreliable labels, and are scarce in training or testing and or
both. This challenge is addressed by a learning paradigm called multimodal
co-learning. The modeling of a (resource-poor) modality is aided by exploiting
knowledge from another (resource-rich) modality using transfer of knowledge
between modalities, including their representations and predictive models.
Co-learning being an emerging area, there are no dedicated reviews explicitly
focusing on all challenges addressed by co-learning. To that end, in this work,
we provide a comprehensive survey on the emerging area of multimodal
co-learning that has not been explored in its entirety yet. We review
implementations that overcome one or more co-learning challenges without
explicitly considering them as co-learning challenges. We present the
comprehensive taxonomy of multimodal co-learning based on the challenges
addressed by co-learning and associated implementations. The various techniques
employed to include the latest ones are reviewed along with some of the
applications and datasets. Our final goal is to discuss challenges and
perspectives along with the important ideas and directions for future work that
we hope to be beneficial for the entire research community focusing on this
exciting domain.</span>

                    <span>Molecular dynamics simulations are a cornerstone in science, allowing to
investigate from the system&#x27;s thermodynamics to analyse intricate molecular
interactions. In general, to create extended molecular trajectories can be a
computationally expensive process, for example, when running $ab-initio$
simulations. Hence, repeating such calculations to either obtain more accurate
thermodynamics or to get a higher resolution in the dynamics generated by a
fine-grained quantum interaction can be time- and computationally-consuming. In
this work, we explore different machine learning (ML) methodologies to increase
the resolution of molecular dynamics trajectories on-demand within a
post-processing step. As a proof of concept, we analyse the performance of
bi-directional neural networks such as neural ODEs, Hamiltonian networks,
recurrent neural networks and LSTMs, as well as the uni-directional variants as
a reference, for molecular dynamics simulations (here: the MD17 dataset). We
have found that Bi-LSTMs are the best performing models; by utilizing the local
time-symmetry of thermostated trajectories they can even learn long-range
correlations and display high robustness to noisy dynamics across molecular
complexity. Our models can reach accuracies of up to 10$^{-4}$ angstroms in
trajectory interpolation, while faithfully reconstructing several full cycles
of unseen intricate high-frequency molecular vibrations, rendering the
comparison between the learned and reference trajectories indistinguishable.
The results reported in this work can serve (1) as a baseline for larger
systems, as well as (2) for the construction of better MD integrators.</span>

airport runways represent an important capability for disaster relief and urban

architectures that translate reversibly between plausible runway maps and
satellite imagery. We illustrate the training capability using paired images
(satellite-map) from the same point of view and using the Pix2Pix architecture
or conditional GANs. In the absence of available pairs, we likewise show that
CycleGAN architectures with four network heads (discriminator-generator pairs)
can also provide effective style transfer from raw image pixels to outline or
feature maps. To emphasize the runway and tarmac boundaries, we experimentally
show that the traditional grey-tan map palette is not a required training input
but can be augmented by higher contrast mapping palettes (red-black) for
sharper runway boundaries. We preview a potentially novel use case (called
&quot;sketch2satellite&quot;) where a human roughly draws the current runway boundaries
and automates the machine output of plausible satellite images. Finally, we
identify examples of faulty runway maps where the published satellite and

                    <span>In image classification, it is often expensive and time-consuming to acquire
sufficient labels. To solve this problem, domain adaptation often provides an
attractive option given a large amount of labeled data from a similar nature
but different domain. Existing approaches mainly align the distributions of
representations extracted by a single structure and the representations may
only contain partial information, e.g., only contain part of the saturation,
brightness, and hue information. Along this line, we propose
Multi-Representation Adaptation which can dramatically improve the
classification accuracy for cross-domain image classification and specially
aims to align the distributions of multiple representations extracted by a
hybrid structure named Inception Adaptation Module (IAM). Based on this, we
present Multi-Representation Adaptation Network (MRAN) to accomplish the
cross-domain image classification task via multi-representation alignment which
can capture the information from different aspects. In addition, we extend
Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) to compute the adaptation loss. Our approach can
be easily implemented by extending most feed-forward models with IAM, and the
network can be trained efficiently via back-propagation. Experiments conducted
on three benchmark image datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of MRAN. The
code has been available at https://github.com/easezyc/deep-transfer-learning.</span>

                    <span>Clinical 12-lead electrocardiography (ECG) is one of the most widely
encountered kinds of biosignals. Despite the increased availability of public
ECG datasets, label scarcity remains a central challenge in the field.
Self-supervised learning represents a promising way to alleviate this issue. In
this work, we put forward the first comprehensive assessment of self-supervised
representation learning from clinical 12-lead ECG data. To this end, we adapt
state-of-the-art self-supervised methods based on instance discrimination and
latent forecasting to the ECG domain. In a first step, we learn contrastive
representations and evaluate their quality based on linear evaluation
performance on a recently established, comprehensive, clinical ECG
classification task. In a second step, we analyze the impact of self-supervised
pretraining on finetuned ECG classifiers as compared to purely supervised
performance. For the best-performing method, an adaptation of contrastive
predictive coding, we find a linear evaluation performance only 0.5% below
supervised performance. For the finetuned models, we find improvements in
downstream performance of roughly 1% compared to supervised performance, label
efficiency, as well as robustness against physiological noise. This work
clearly establishes the feasibility of extracting discriminative
representations from ECG data via self-supervised learning and the numerous
advantages when finetuning such representations on downstream tasks as compared
to purely supervised training. As first comprehensive assessment of its kind in
the ECG domain carried out exclusively on publicly available datasets, we hope
to establish a first step towards reproducible progress in the rapidly evolving
field of representation learning for biosignals.</span>

                    <span>Retinal vascular diseases affect the well-being of human body and sometimes
provide vital signs of otherwise undetected bodily damage. Recently, deep
learning techniques have been successfully applied for detection of diabetic
retinopathy (DR). The main obstacle of applying deep learning techniques to
detect most other retinal vascular diseases is the limited amount of data
available. In this paper, we propose a transfer learning technique that aims to
utilize the feature similarities for detecting retinal vascular diseases. We
choose the well-studied DR detection as a source task and identify the early
detection of retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) as the target task. Our
experimental results demonstrate that our DR-pretrained approach dominates in
all metrics the conventional ImageNet-pretrained transfer learning approach,
currently adopted in medical image analysis. Moreover, our approach is more
robust with respect to the stochasticity in the training process and with
respect to reduced training samples. This study suggests the potential of our
proposed transfer learning approach for a broad range of retinal vascular
diseases or pathologies, where data is limited.</span>

                    <span>Centralized Training for Decentralized Execution, where training is done in a
centralized offline fashion, has become a popular solution paradigm in
Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning. Many such methods take the form of
actor-critic with state-based critics, since centralized training allows access
to the true system state, which can be useful during training despite not being
available at execution time. State-based critics have become a common empirical
choice, albeit one which has had limited theoretical justification or analysis.
In this paper, we show that state-based critics can introduce bias in the
policy gradient estimates, potentially undermining the asymptotic guarantees of
the algorithm. We also show that, even if the state-based critics do not
introduce any bias, they can still result in a larger gradient variance,
contrary to the common intuition. Finally, we show the effects of the theories
in practice by comparing different forms of centralized critics on a wide range
of common benchmarks, and detail how various environmental properties are
related to the effectiveness of different types of critics.</span>

                    <span>Kendall transformation is a conversion of an ordered feature into a vector of
pairwise order relations between individual values. This way, it preserves
ranking of observations and represents it in a categorical form.

Such transformation allows for generalisation of methods requiring strictly
categorical input, especially in the limit of small number of observations,
when discretisation becomes problematic. In particular, many approaches of
information theory can be directly applied to Kendall-transformed continuous
data without relying on differential entropy or any additional parameters.
Moreover, by filtering information to this contained in ranking, Kendall
transformation leads to a better robustness at a reasonable cost of dropping
sophisticated interactions which are anyhow unlikely to be correctly estimated.

In bivariate analysis, Kendall transformation can be related to popular
non-parametric methods, showing the soundness of the approach. The paper also
demonstrates its efficiency in multivariate problems, as well as provides an
example analysis of a real-world data.</span>

                    <span>We investigate the use of a multi-agent multi-armed bandit (MA-MAB) setting
for modeling repeated Cournot oligopoly games, where the firms acting as agents
choose from the set of arms representing production quantity (a discrete
value). Agents interact with separate and independent bandit problems. In this
formulation, each agent makes sequential choices among arms to maximize its own
reward. Agents do not have any information about the environment; they can only
see their own rewards after taking an action. However, the market demand is a
stationary function of total industry output, and random entry or exit from the
market is not allowed. Given these assumptions, we found that an
$\epsilon$-greedy approach offers a more viable learning mechanism than other
traditional MAB approaches, as it does not require any additional knowledge of
the system to operate. We also propose two novel approaches that take advantage
of the ordered action space: $\epsilon$-greedy+HL and $\epsilon$-greedy+EL.
These new approaches help firms to focus on more profitable actions by
eliminating less profitable choices and hence are designed to optimize the
exploration. We use computer simulations to study the emergence of various
equilibria in the outcomes and do the empirical analysis of joint cumulative
regrets.</span>

discriminability. The convolutional layer uses linear filters to scan the input

with more complex structures to capture the features within the receptive
field. The feature maps are obtained by sliding the PQCs over the input in a
similar way as CNN. We also give a training algorithm for the proposed model.
The hybrid models used in our design are validated by numerical simulation. We

                    <span>Supervised operator learning is an emerging machine learning paradigm with
applications to modeling the evolution of spatio-temporal dynamical systems and
approximating general black-box relationships between functional data. We
propose a novel operator learning method, LOCA (Learning Operators with Coupled
Attention), motivated from the recent success of the attention mechanism. In
our architecture, the input functions are mapped to a finite set of features
which are then averaged with attention weights that depend on the output query
locations. By coupling these attention weights together with an integral
transform, LOCA is able to explicitly learn correlations in the target output
functions, enabling us to approximate nonlinear operators even when the number
of output function in the training set measurements is very small. Our
formulation is accompanied by rigorous approximation theoretic guarantees on
the universal expressiveness of the proposed model. Empirically, we evaluate
the performance of LOCA on several operator learning scenarios involving
systems governed by ordinary and partial differential equations, as well as a
black-box climate prediction problem. Through these scenarios we demonstrate
state of the art accuracy, robustness with respect to noisy input data, and a
consistently small spread of errors over testing data sets, even for
out-of-distribution prediction tasks.</span>

                    <span>Conventional machine learning (ML) relies heavily on manual design from
machine learning experts to decide learning tasks, data, models, optimization
algorithms, and evaluation metrics, which is labor-intensive, time-consuming,
and cannot learn autonomously like humans. In education science, self-directed
learning, where human learners select learning tasks and materials on their own
without requiring hands-on guidance, has been shown to be more effective than
passive teacher-guided learning. Inspired by the concept of self-directed human
learning, we introduce the principal concept of Self-directed Machine Learning
(SDML) and propose a framework for SDML. Specifically, we design SDML as a
self-directed learning process guided by self-awareness, including internal
awareness and external awareness. Our proposed SDML process benefits from self
task selection, self data selection, self model selection, self optimization
strategy selection and self evaluation metric selection through self-awareness
without human guidance. Meanwhile, the learning performance of the SDML process
serves as feedback to further improve self-awareness. We propose a mathematical
formulation for SDML based on multi-level optimization. Furthermore, we present
case studies together with potential applications of SDML, followed by
discussing future research directions. We expect that SDML could enable
machines to conduct human-like self-directed learning and provide a new
perspective towards artificial general intelligence.</span>

                    <span>We develop a theoretical analysis for special neural network architectures,
termed operator recurrent neural networks, for approximating nonlinear
functions whose inputs are linear operators. Such functions commonly arise in
solution algorithms for inverse boundary value problems. Traditional neural
networks treat input data as vectors, and thus they do not effectively capture
the multiplicative structure associated with the linear operators that
correspond to the data in such inverse problems. We therefore introduce a new
family that resembles a standard neural network architecture, but where the
input data acts multiplicatively on vectors. Motivated by compact operators
appearing in boundary control and the analysis of inverse boundary value
problems for the wave equation, we promote structure and sparsity in selected
weight matrices in the network. After describing this architecture, we study
its representation properties as well as its approximation properties. We
furthermore show that an explicit regularization can be introduced that can be
derived from the mathematical analysis of the mentioned inverse problems, and
which leads to certain guarantees on the generalization properties. We observe
that the sparsity of the weight matrices improves the generalization estimates.
Lastly, we discuss how operator recurrent networks can be viewed as a deep
learning analogue to deterministic algorithms such as boundary control for
reconstructing the unknown wavespeed in the acoustic wave equation from
boundary measurements.</span>

                    <span>To this day, a variety of approaches for providing local interpretability of
black-box machine learning models have been introduced. Unfortunately, all of
these methods suffer from one or more of the following deficiencies: They are
either difficult to understand themselves, they work on a per-feature basis and
ignore the dependencies between features and/or they only focus on those
features asserting the decision made by the model. To address these points,
this work introduces a reinforcement learning-based approach called Monte Carlo
tree search for eXplainable Artificial Intelligent (McXai) to explain the
decisions of any black-box classification model (classifier). Our method
leverages Monte Carlo tree search and models the process of generating
explanations as two games. In one game, the reward is maximized by finding
feature sets that support the decision of the classifier, while in the second
game, finding feature sets leading to alternative decisions maximizes the
reward. The result is a human friendly representation as a tree structure, in
which each node represents a set of features to be studied with smaller
explanations at the top of the tree. Our experiments show, that the features
found by our method are more informative with respect to classifications than
those found by classical approaches like LIME and SHAP. Furthermore, by also
identifying misleading features, our approach is able to guide towards improved
robustness of the black-box model in many situations.</span>

                    <span>Semantic segmentation of brain tumors is a fundamental medical image analysis
task involving multiple MRI imaging modalities that can assist clinicians in
diagnosing the patient and successively studying the progression of the
malignant entity. In recent years, Fully Convolutional Neural Networks (FCNNs)
approaches have become the de facto standard for 3D medical image segmentation.
The popular &quot;U-shaped&quot; network architecture has achieved state-of-the-art
performance benchmarks on different 2D and 3D semantic segmentation tasks and
across various imaging modalities. However, due to the limited kernel size of
convolution layers in FCNNs, their performance of modeling long-range
information is sub-optimal, and this can lead to deficiencies in the
segmentation of tumors with variable sizes. On the other hand, transformer
models have demonstrated excellent capabilities in capturing such long-range
information in multiple domains, including natural language processing and
computer vision. Inspired by the success of vision transformers and their
variants, we propose a novel segmentation model termed Swin UNEt TRansformers
(Swin UNETR). Specifically, the task of 3D brain tumor semantic segmentation is
reformulated as a sequence to sequence prediction problem wherein multi-modal
input data is projected into a 1D sequence of embedding and used as an input to
a hierarchical Swin transformer as the encoder. The swin transformer encoder
extracts features at five different resolutions by utilizing shifted windows
for computing self-attention and is connected to an FCNN-based decoder at each
resolution via skip connections. We have participated in BraTS 2021
segmentation challenge, and our proposed model ranks among the top-performing
approaches in the validation phase. Code: https://monai.io/research/swin-unetr</span>

learning approaches focus on preserving the \emph{overall} classification
accuracy while improving fairness. In the presence of class-imbalance, such
methods may further aggravate the problem of discrimination by denying an
already underrepresented group (e.g., \textit{females}) the fundamental rights
of equal social privileges (e.g., equal credit opportunity).

To this end, we propose AdaFair, a fairness-aware boosting ensemble that
changes the data distribution at each round, taking into account not only the
class errors but also the fairness-related performance of the model defined
cumulatively based on the partial ensemble. Except for the in-training boosting
of the group discriminated over each round, AdaFair directly tackles imbalance
during the post-training phase by optimizing the number of ensemble learners
for balanced error performance (BER). AdaFair can facilitate different
parity-based fairness notions and mitigate effectively discriminatory outcomes.
Our experiments show that our approach can achieve parity in terms of
statistical parity, equal opportunity, and disparate mistreatment while
maintaining good predictive performance for all classes.</span>

                    <span>Various approaches have been proposed for out-of-distribution (OOD) detection
by augmenting models, input examples, training sets, and optimization
objectives. Deviating from existing work, we have a simple hypothesis that
standard off-the-shelf models may already contain sufficient information about
the training set distribution which can be leveraged for reliable OOD
detection. Our empirical study on validating this hypothesis, which measures
the model activation&#x27;s mean for OOD and in-distribution (ID) mini-batches,
surprisingly finds that activation means of OOD mini-batches consistently
deviate more from those of the training data. In addition, training data&#x27;s
activation means can be computed offline efficiently or retrieved from batch
normalization layers as a &#x60;free lunch&#x27;. Based upon this observation, we propose
a novel metric called Neural Mean Discrepancy (NMD), which compares neural
means of the input examples and training data. Leveraging the simplicity of
NMD, we propose an efficient OOD detector that computes neural means by a
standard forward pass followed by a lightweight classifier. Extensive
experiments show that NMD outperforms state-of-the-art OOD approaches across
multiple datasets and model architectures in terms of both detection accuracy
and computational cost.</span>

                    <span>Profile guided optimization is an effective technique for improving the
optimization ability of compilers based on dynamic behavior, but collecting
profile data is expensive, cumbersome, and requires regular updating to remain
fresh. We present a novel statistical approach to inferring branch
probabilities that improves the performance of programs that are compiled
without profile guided optimizations. We perform offline training using
information that is collected from a large corpus of binaries that have branch
probabilities information. The learned model is used by the compiler to predict
the branch probabilities of regular uninstrumented programs, which the compiler
can then use to inform optimization decisions. We integrate our technique
directly in LLVM, supplementing the existing human-engineered compiler
heuristics. We evaluate our technique on a suite of benchmarks, demonstrating
some gains over compiling without profile information. In deployment, our
technique requires no profiling runs and has negligible effect on compilation
time.</span>

                    <span>With the explosive growth of the e-commerce industry, detecting online
transaction fraud in real-world applications has become increasingly important
to the development of e-commerce platforms. The sequential behavior history of
users provides useful information in differentiating fraudulent payments from
regular ones. Recently, some approaches have been proposed to solve this
sequence-based fraud detection problem. However, these methods usually suffer
from two problems: the prediction results are difficult to explain and the
exploitation of the internal information of behaviors is insufficient. To
tackle the above two problems, we propose a Hierarchical Explainable Network
(HEN) to model users&#x27; behavior sequences, which could not only improve the
performance of fraud detection but also make the inference process
interpretable. Meanwhile, as e-commerce business expands to new domains, e.g.,
new countries or new markets, one major problem for modeling user behavior in
fraud detection systems is the limitation of data collection, e.g., very few
data/labels available. Thus, in this paper, we further propose a transfer
framework to tackle the cross-domain fraud detection problem, which aims to
transfer knowledge from existing domains (source domains) with enough and
mature data to improve the performance in the new domain (target domain). Our
proposed method is a general transfer framework that could not only be applied
upon HEN but also various existing models in the Embedding &amp; MLP paradigm.
Based on 90 transfer task experiments, we also demonstrate that our transfer
framework could not only contribute to the cross-domain fraud detection task
with HEN, but also be universal and expandable for various existing models.</span>

                    <span>Machine learning, with its advances in Deep Learning has shown great
potential in analysing time series in the past. However, in many scenarios,
additional information is available that can potentially improve predictions,
by incorporating it into the learning methods. This is crucial for data that
arises from e.g., sensor networks that contain information about sensor
locations. Then, such spatial information can be exploited by modeling it via
graph structures, along with the sequential (time) information. Recent advances
in adapting Deep Learning to graphs have shown promising potential in various
graph-related tasks. However, these methods have not been adapted for time
series related tasks to a great extent. Specifically, most attempts have
essentially consolidated around Spatial-Temporal Graph Neural Networks for time
series forecasting with small sequence lengths. Generally, these architectures
are not suited for regression or classification tasks that contain large
sequences of data. Therefore, in this work, we propose an architecture capable
of processing these long sequences in a multivariate time series regression
task, using the benefits of Graph Neural Networks to improve predictions. Our
model is tested on two seismic datasets that contain earthquake waveforms,
where the goal is to predict intensity measurements of ground shaking at a set
of stations. Our findings demonstrate promising results of our approach, which
are discussed in depth with an additional ablation study.</span>

                    <span>Value function factorization via centralized training and decentralized
execution is promising for solving cooperative multi-agent reinforcement tasks.
One of the approaches in this area, QMIX, has become state-of-the-art and
achieved the best performance on the StarCraft II micromanagement benchmark.
However, the monotonic-mixing of per agent estimates in QMIX is known to
restrict the joint action Q-values it can represent, as well as the
insufficient global state information for single agent value function
estimation, often resulting in suboptimality. To this end, we present LSF-SAC,
a novel framework that features a variational inference-based
information-sharing mechanism as extra state information to assist individual
agents in the value function factorization. We demonstrate that such latent
individual state information sharing can significantly expand the power of
value function factorization, while fully decentralized execution can still be
maintained in LSF-SAC through a soft-actor-critic design. We evaluate LSF-SAC
on the StarCraft II micromanagement challenge and demonstrate that it
outperforms several state-of-the-art methods in challenging collaborative
tasks. We further set extensive ablation studies for locating the key factors
accounting for its performance improvements. We believe that this new insight
can lead to new local value estimation methods and variational deep learning
algorithms. A demo video and code of implementation can be found at

                    <span>Graph machine learning has been extensively studied in both academic and
industry. However, as the literature on graph learning booms with a vast number
of emerging methods and techniques, it becomes increasingly difficult to
manually design the optimal machine learning algorithm for different
graph-related tasks. To tackle the challenge, automated graph machine learning,
which aims at discovering the best hyper-parameter and neural architecture
configuration for different graph tasks/data without manual design, is gaining
an increasing number of attentions from the research community. In this paper,
we extensively discuss automated graph machine approaches, covering
hyper-parameter optimization (HPO) and neural architecture search (NAS) for
graph machine learning. We briefly overview existing libraries designed for
either graph machine learning or automated machine learning respectively, and
further in depth introduce AutoGL, our dedicated and the world&#x27;s first
open-source library for automated graph machine learning. Last but not least,
we share our insights on future research directions for automated graph machine
learning. This paper is the first systematic and comprehensive discussion of
approaches, libraries as well as directions for automated graph machine
learning.</span>

                    <span>Even though many semantic segmentation methods exist that are able to perform
well on many medical datasets, often, they are not designed for direct use in
clinical practice. The two main concerns are generalization to unseen data with
a different visual appearance, e.g., images acquired using a different scanner,
and efficiency in terms of computation time and required Graphics Processing
Unit (GPU) memory. In this work, we employ a multi-organ segmentation model
based on the SpatialConfiguration-Net (SCN), which integrates prior knowledge
of the spatial configuration among the labelled organs to resolve spurious
responses in the network outputs. Furthermore, we modified the architecture of
the segmentation model to reduce its memory footprint as much as possible
without drastically impacting the quality of the predictions. Lastly, we
implemented a minimal inference script for which we optimized both, execution
time and required GPU memory.</span>

                    <span>Weighting strategy prevails in machine learning. For example, a common
approach in robust machine learning is to exert lower weights on samples which
are likely to be noisy or quite hard. This study reveals another undiscovered
strategy, namely, compensating. Various incarnations of compensating have been
utilized but it has not been explicitly revealed. Learning with compensating is
called compensation learning and a systematic taxonomy is constructed for it in
this study. In our taxonomy, compensation learning is divided on the basis of
the compensation targets, directions, inference manners, and granularity
levels. Many existing learning algorithms including some classical ones can be
viewed or understood at least partially as compensation techniques.
Furthermore, a family of new learning algorithms can be obtained by plugging
the compensation learning into existing learning algorithms. Specifically, two
concrete new learning algorithms are proposed for robust machine learning.
Extensive experiments on image classification and text sentiment analysis
verify the effectiveness of the two new algorithms. Compensation learning can
also be used in other various learning scenarios, such as imbalance learning,
clustering, regression, and so on.</span>

                    <span>Databases covering all individuals of a population are increasingly used for
research studies in domains ranging from public health to the social sciences.
There is also growing interest by governments and businesses to use population
data to support data-driven decision making. The massive size of such databases
is often mistaken as a guarantee for valid inferences on the population of
interest. However, population data have characteristics that make them
challenging to use, including various assumptions being made how such data were
collected and what types of processing have been applied to them. Furthermore,
the full potential of population data can often only be unlocked when such data
are linked to other databases, a process that adds fresh challenges. This
article discusses a diverse range of misconceptions about population data that
we believe anybody who works with such data needs to be aware of. Many of these

discussed anecdotally among researchers and practitioners. We conclude with a

                    <span>Air access networks have been recognized as a significant driver of various
Internet of Things (IoT) services and applications. In particular, the aerial
computing network infrastructure centered on the Internet of Drones has set off
a new revolution in automatic image recognition. This emerging technology
relies on sharing ground truth labeled data between Unmanned Aerial Vehicle
(UAV) swarms to train a high-quality automatic image recognition model.
However, such an approach will bring data privacy and data availability
challenges. To address these issues, we first present a Semi-supervised
Federated Learning (SSFL) framework for privacy-preserving UAV image
recognition. Specifically, we propose model parameters mixing strategy to
improve the naive combination of FL and semi-supervised learning methods under
two realistic scenarios (labels-at-client and labels-at-server), which is
referred to as Federated Mixing (FedMix). Furthermore, there are significant
differences in the number, features, and distribution of local data collected
by UAVs using different camera modules in different environments, i.e.,
statistical heterogeneity. To alleviate the statistical heterogeneity problem,
we propose an aggregation rule based on the frequency of the client&#x27;s
participation in training, namely the FedFreq aggregation rule, which can
adjust the weight of the corresponding local model according to its frequency.
Numerical results demonstrate that the performance of our proposed method is
significantly better than those of the current baseline and is robust to
different non-IID levels of client data.</span>

                    <span>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are recently proposed neural network structures
for the processing of graph-structured data. Due to their employed neighbor
aggregation strategy, existing GNNs focus on capturing node-level information
and neglect high-level information. Existing GNNs therefore suffer from
representational limitations caused by the Local Permutation Invariance (LPI)
problem. To overcome these limitations and enrich the features captured by
GNNs, we propose a novel GNN framework, referred to as the Two-level GNN
(TL-GNN). This merges subgraph-level information with node-level information.
Moreover, we provide a mathematical analysis of the LPI problem which
demonstrates that subgraph-level information is beneficial to overcoming the
problems associated with LPI. A subgraph counting method based on the dynamic
programming algorithm is also proposed, and this has time complexity is O(n^3),
n is the number of nodes of a graph. Experiments show that TL-GNN outperforms
existing GNNs and achieves state-of-the-art performance.</span>

observations). However, in real-world applications, few-shot learning paradigm
often suffers from data shift, i.e., samples in different tasks, even in the
same task, could be drawn from various data distributions. Most existing
few-shot learning approaches are not designed with the consideration of data
shift, and thus show downgraded performance when data distribution shifts.
However, it is non-trivial to address the data shift problem in few-shot
learning, due to the limited number of labeled samples in each task. Targeting
at addressing this problem, we propose a novel metric-based meta-learning
framework to extract task-specific representations and task-shared
representations with the help of knowledge graph. The data shift within/between
tasks can thus be combated by the combination of task-shared and task-specific
representations. The proposed model is evaluated on popular benchmarks and two
constructed new challenging datasets. The evaluation results demonstrate its
remarkable performance.</span>

                    <span>Deep neural networks (DNNs) are known to be vulnerable to adversarial
attacks. A range of defense methods have been proposed to train adversarially
robust DNNs, among which adversarial training has demonstrated promising
results. However, despite preliminary understandings developed for adversarial
training, it is still not clear, from the architectural perspective, what
configurations can lead to more robust DNNs. In this paper, we address this gap
via a comprehensive investigation on the impact of network width and depth on
the robustness of adversarially trained DNNs. Specifically, we make the
following key observations: 1) more parameters (higher model capacity) does not
necessarily help adversarial robustness; 2) reducing capacity at the last stage
(the last group of blocks) of the network can actually improve adversarial
robustness; and 3) under the same parameter budget, there exists an optimal
architectural configuration for adversarial robustness. We also provide a
theoretical analysis explaning why such network configuration can help
robustness. These architectural insights can help design adversarially robust
DNNs. Code is available at \url{https://github.com/HanxunH/RobustWRN}.</span>

                    <span>Modern generative models achieve excellent quality in a variety of tasks
including image or text generation and chemical molecule modeling. However,
existing methods often lack the essential ability to generate examples with
requested properties, such as the age of the person in the photo or the weight
of the generated molecule. Incorporating such additional conditioning factors
would require rebuilding the entire architecture and optimizing the parameters
from scratch. Moreover, it is difficult to disentangle selected attributes so
that to perform edits of only one attribute while leaving the others unchanged.
To overcome these limitations we propose PluGeN (Plugin Generative Network), a
simple yet effective generative technique that can be used as a plugin to
pre-trained generative models. The idea behind our approach is to transform the
entangled latent representation using a flow-based module into a
multi-dimensional space where the values of each attribute are modeled as an
independent one-dimensional distribution. In consequence, PluGeN can generate
new samples with desired attributes as well as manipulate labeled attributes of
existing examples. Due to the disentangling of the latent representation, we
are even able to generate samples with rare or unseen combinations of
attributes in the dataset, such as a young person with gray hair, men with
make-up, or women with beards. We combined PluGeN with GAN and VAE models and
applied it to conditional generation and manipulation of images and chemical
molecule modeling. Experiments demonstrate that PluGeN preserves the quality of
backbone models while adding the ability to control the values of labeled
attributes.</span>

                    <span>In the paper, we propose a class of accelerated zeroth-order and first-order
momentum methods for both nonconvex mini-optimization and minimax-optimization.
Specifically, we propose a new accelerated zeroth-order momentum (Acc-ZOM)
method for black-box mini-optimization. Moreover, we prove that our Acc-ZOM
method achieves a lower query complexity of $\tilde{O}(d^{3/4}\epsilon^{-3})$
for finding an $\epsilon$-stationary point, which improves the best known
result by a factor of $O(d^{1/4})$ where $d$ denotes the variable dimension. In
particular, the Acc-ZOM does not require large batches required in the existing
zeroth-order stochastic algorithms. Meanwhile, we propose an accelerated
\textbf{zeroth-order} momentum descent ascent (Acc-ZOMDA) method for
\textbf{black-box} minimax-optimization, which obtains a query complexity of
$\tilde{O}((d_1+d_2)^{3/4}\kappa_y^{4.5}\epsilon^{-3})$ without large batches
for finding an $\epsilon$-stationary point, where $d_1$ and $d_2$ denote
variable dimensions and $\kappa_y$ is condition number. Moreover, we propose an
accelerated \textbf{first-order} momentum descent ascent (Acc-MDA) method for
\textbf{white-box} minimax optimization, which has a gradient complexity of
$\tilde{O}(\kappa_y^{4.5}\epsilon^{-3})$ without large batches for finding an
$\epsilon$-stationary point. In particular, our Acc-MDA can obtain a lower
gradient complexity of $\tilde{O}(\kappa_y^{2.5}\epsilon^{-3})$ with a batch
size $O(\kappa_y^4)$. Extensive experimental results on the black-box
adversarial attack to deep neural networks (DNNs) and poisoning attack
demonstrate efficiency of our algorithms.</span>

                    <span>Deep metric learning aims to learn an embedding space where the distance
between data reflects their class equivalence, even when their classes are
unseen during training. However, the limited number of classes available in
training precludes generalization of the learned embedding space. Motivated by
this, we introduce a new data augmentation approach that synthesizes novel
classes and their embedding vectors. Our approach can provide rich semantic
information to an embedding model and improve its generalization by augmenting
training data with novel classes unavailable in the original data. We implement
this idea by learning and exploiting a conditional generative model, which,
given a class label and a noise, produces a random embedding vector of the
class. Our proposed generator allows the loss to use richer class relations by
augmenting realistic and diverse classes, resulting in better generalization to
unseen samples. Experimental results on public benchmark datasets demonstrate
that our method clearly enhances the performance of proxy-based losses.</span>

                    <span>Comparing structured objects such as graphs is a fundamental operation
involved in many learning tasks. To this end, the Gromov-Wasserstein (GW)
distance, based on Optimal Transport (OT), has proven to be successful in
handling the specific nature of the associated objects. More specifically,
through the nodes connectivity relations, GW operates on graphs, seen as
probability measures over specific spaces. At the core of OT is the idea of
conservation of mass, which imposes a coupling between all the nodes from the
two considered graphs. We argue in this paper that this property can be
detrimental for tasks such as graph dictionary or partition learning, and we
relax it by proposing a new semi-relaxed Gromov-Wasserstein divergence. Aside
from immediate computational benefits, we discuss its properties, and show that
it can lead to an efficient graph dictionary learning algorithm. We empirically
demonstrate its relevance for complex tasks on graphs such as partitioning,
clustering and completion.</span>

                    <span>Despite Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have achieved remarkable accuracy,
whether the results are trustworthy is still unexplored. Previous studies
suggest that many modern neural networks are over-confident on the predictions,
however, surprisingly, we discover that GNNs are primarily in the opposite
direction, i.e., GNNs are under-confident. Therefore, the confidence
calibration for GNNs is highly desired. In this paper, we propose a novel
trustworthy GNN model by designing a topology-aware post-hoc calibration
function. Specifically, we first verify that the confidence distribution in a
graph has homophily property, and this finding inspires us to design a
calibration GNN model (CaGCN) to learn the calibration function. CaGCN is able
to obtain a unique transformation from logits of GNNs to the calibrated
confidence for each node, meanwhile, such transformation is able to preserve
the order between classes, satisfying the accuracy-preserving property.
Moreover, we apply the calibration GNN to self-training framework, showing that
more trustworthy pseudo labels can be obtained with the calibrated confidence
and further improve the performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate the
effectiveness of our proposed model in terms of both calibration and accuracy.</span>

                    <span>Recent advances in deep reinforcement learning (RL) have led to considerable
progress in many 2-player zero-sum games, such as Go, Poker and Starcraft. The
purely adversarial nature of such games allows for conceptually simple and
principled application of RL methods. However real-world settings are
many-agent, and agent interactions are complex mixtures of common-interest and
competitive aspects. We consider Diplomacy, a 7-player board game designed to
accentuate dilemmas resulting from many-agent interactions. It also features a
large combinatorial action space and simultaneous moves, which are challenging
for RL algorithms. We propose a simple yet effective approximate best response
operator, designed to handle large combinatorial action spaces and simultaneous
moves. We also introduce a family of policy iteration methods that approximate
fictitious play. With these methods, we successfully apply RL to Diplomacy: we
show that our agents convincingly outperform the previous state-of-the-art, and
game theoretic equilibrium analysis shows that the new process yields
consistent improvements.</span>

                    <span>The intriguing phenomenon of adversarial examples has attracted significant
attention in machine learning and what might be more surprising to the
community is the existence of universal adversarial perturbations (UAPs), i.e.
a single perturbation to fool the target DNN for most images. With the focus on
UAP against deep classifiers, this survey summarizes the recent progress on
universal adversarial attacks, discussing the challenges from both the attack
and defense sides, as well as the reason for the existence of UAP. We aim to

                    <span>The literature on robustness towards common corruptions shows no consensus on
whether adversarial training can improve the performance in this setting.
First, we show that, when used with an appropriately selected perturbation
radius, $\ell_p$ adversarial training can serve as a strong baseline against
common corruptions improving both accuracy and calibration. Then we explain why
adversarial training performs better than data augmentation with simple
Gaussian noise which has been observed to be a meaningful baseline on common
corruptions. Related to this, we identify the $\sigma$-overfitting phenomenon
when Gaussian augmentation overfits to a particular standard deviation used for
training which has a significant detrimental effect on common corruption
accuracy. We discuss how to alleviate this problem and then how to further
enhance $\ell_p$ adversarial training by introducing an efficient relaxation of
adversarial training with learned perceptual image patch similarity as the
distance metric. Through experiments on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet-100, we show that
our approach does not only improve the $\ell_p$ adversarial training baseline
but also has cumulative gains with data augmentation methods such as AugMix,
DeepAugment, ANT, and SIN, leading to state-of-the-art performance on common
corruptions.

                    <span>Light field (LF) imaging, which captures both spatial and angular information
of a scene, is undoubtedly beneficial to numerous applications. Although
various techniques have been proposed for LF acquisition, achieving both
angularly and spatially high-resolution LF remains a technology challenge. In
this paper, a learning-based approach applied to 3D epipolar image (EPI) is
proposed to reconstruct high-resolution LF. Through a 2-stage super-resolution
framework, the proposed approach effectively addresses various LF
super-resolution (SR) problems, i.e., spatial SR, angular SR, and
angular-spatial SR. While the first stage provides flexible options to
up-sample EPI volume to the desired resolution, the second stage, which
consists of a novel EPI volume-based refinement network (EVRN), substantially
enhances the quality of the high-resolution EPI volume. An extensive evaluation
on 90 challenging synthetic and real-world light field scenes from 7 published
datasets shows that the proposed approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods
to a large extend for both spatial and angular super-resolution problem, i.e.,
an average peak signal to noise ratio improvement of more than 2.0 dB, 1.4 dB,
and 3.14 dB in spatial SR $\times 2$, spatial SR $\times 4$, and angular SR
respectively. The reconstructed 4D light field demonstrates a balanced
performance distribution across all perspective images and presents superior
visual quality compared to the previous works.</span>

                    <span>The rapid mutation of the influenza virus threatens public health.
Reassortment among viruses with different hosts can lead to a fatal pandemic.
However, it is difficult to detect the original host of the virus during or
after an outbreak as influenza viruses can circulate between different species.
Therefore, early and rapid detection of the viral host would help reduce the
further spread of the virus. We use various machine learning models with
features derived from the position-specific scoring matrix (PSSM) and features
learned from word embedding and word encoding to infer the origin host of
viruses. The results show that the performance of the PSSM-based model reaches
the MCC around 95%, and the F1 around 96%. The MCC obtained using the model

                    <span>We apply deep metric learning for the first time to the prob-lem of
classifying planktic foraminifer shells on microscopic images. This species
recognition task is an important information source and scientific pillar for
reconstructing past climates. All foraminifer CNN recognition pipelines in the
literature produce black-box classifiers that lack visualisation options for
human experts and cannot be applied to open set problems. Here, we benchmark
metric learning against these pipelines, produce the first scientific
visualisation of the phenotypic planktic foraminifer morphology space, and
demonstrate that metric learning can be used to cluster species unseen during
training. We show that metric learning out-performs all published CNN-based
state-of-the-art benchmarks in this domain. We evaluate our approach on the
34,640 expert-annotated images of the Endless Forams public library of 35
modern planktic foraminifera species. Our results on this data show leading 92%
accuracy (at 0.84 F1-score) in reproducing expert labels on withheld test data,
and 66.5% accuracy (at 0.70 F1-score) when clustering species never encountered
in training. We conclude that metric learning is highly effective for this
domain and serves as an important tool towards expert-in-the-loop automation of
microfossil identification. Key code, network weights, and data splits are

                    <span>One principal impediment in the successful deployment of AI-based
Computer-Aided Diagnosis (CAD) systems in clinical workflows is their lack of
transparent decision making. Although commonly used eXplainable AI methods
provide some insight into opaque algorithms, such explanations are usually
convoluted and not readily comprehensible except by highly trained experts. The
explanation of decisions regarding the malignancy of skin lesions from
dermoscopic images demands particular clarity, as the underlying medical
problem definition is itself ambiguous. This work presents ExAID (Explainable
AI for Dermatology), a novel framework for biomedical image analysis, providing
multi-modal concept-based explanations consisting of easy-to-understand textual
explanations supplemented by visual maps justifying the predictions. ExAID
relies on Concept Activation Vectors to map human concepts to those learnt by
arbitrary Deep Learning models in latent space, and Concept Localization Maps
to highlight concepts in the input space. This identification of relevant
concepts is then used to construct fine-grained textual explanations
supplemented by concept-wise location information to provide comprehensive and
coherent multi-modal explanations. All information is comprehensively presented
in a diagnostic interface for use in clinical routines. An educational mode
provides dataset-level explanation statistics and tools for data and model
exploration to aid medical research and education. Through rigorous
quantitative and qualitative evaluation of ExAID, we show the utility of
multi-modal explanations for CAD-assisted scenarios even in case of wrong

                    <span>In recent years, proposed studies on time-series anomaly detection (TAD)
report high F1 scores on benchmark TAD datasets, giving the impression of clear
improvements in TAD. However, most studies apply a peculiar evaluation protocol
called point adjustment (PA) before scoring. In this paper, we theoretically
and experimentally reveal that the PA protocol has a great possibility of
overestimating the detection performance; that is, even a random anomaly score
can easily turn into a state-of-the-art TAD method. Therefore, the comparison
of TAD methods after applying the PA protocol can lead to misguided rankings.
Furthermore, we question the potential of existing TAD methods by showing that
an untrained model obtains comparable detection performance to the existing
methods even when PA is forbidden. Based on our findings, we propose a new
baseline and an evaluation protocol. We expect that our study will help a
rigorous evaluation of TAD and lead to further improvement in future
researches.</span>

                    <span>For each partition of a data set into a given number of parts there is a
partition such that every part is as much as possible a good model (an
&quot;algorithmic sufficient statistic&quot;) for the data in that part. Since this can
be done for every number between one and the number of data, the result is a
function, the cluster structure function. It maps the number of parts of a
partition to values related to the deficiencies of being good models by the
parts. Such a function starts with a value at least zero for no partition of
the data set and descents to zero for the partition of the data set into
singleton parts. The optimal clustering is the one chosen to minimize the
cluster structure function. The theory behind the method is expressed in
algorithmic information theory (Kolmogorov complexity). In practice the
Kolmogorov complexities involved are approximated by a concrete compressor. We
give examples using real data sets: the MNIST handwritten digits and the
segmentation of real cells as used in stem cell research.</span>

                    <span>Imbalanced datasets are commonplace in modern machine learning problems. The
presence of under-represented classes or groups with sensitive attributes
results in concerns about generalization and fairness. Such concerns are
further exacerbated by the fact that large capacity deep nets can perfectly fit
the training data and appear to achieve perfect accuracy and fairness during
training, but perform poorly during test. To address these challenges, we
propose AutoBalance, a bi-level optimization framework that automatically
designs a training loss function to optimize a blend of accuracy and
fairness-seeking objectives. Specifically, a lower-level problem trains the
model weights, and an upper-level problem tunes the loss function by monitoring
and optimizing the desired objective over the validation data. Our loss design
enables personalized treatment for classes/groups by employing a parametric
cross-entropy loss and individualized data augmentation schemes. We evaluate
the benefits and performance of our approach for the application scenarios of
imbalanced and group-sensitive classification. Extensive empirical evaluations
demonstrate the benefits of AutoBalance over state-of-the-art approaches. Our
experimental findings are complemented with theoretical insights on loss
function design and the benefits of train-validation split. All code is
available open-source.</span>

                    <span>The field of Continual Learning (CL) seeks to develop algorithms that
accumulate knowledge and skills over time through interaction with
non-stationary environments. In practice, a plethora of evaluation procedures
(settings) and algorithmic solutions (methods) exist, each with their own
potentially disjoint set of assumptions. This variety makes measuring progress
in CL difficult. We propose a taxonomy of settings, where each setting is
described as a set of assumptions. A tree-shaped hierarchy emerges from this
view, where more general settings become the parents of those with more
restrictive assumptions. This makes it possible to use inheritance to share and
reuse research, as developing a method for a given setting also makes it
directly applicable onto any of its children. We instantiate this idea as a
publicly available software framework called Sequoia, which features a wide
variety of settings from both the Continual Supervised Learning (CSL) and
Continual Reinforcement Learning (CRL) domains. Sequoia also includes a growing
suite of methods which are easy to extend and customize, in addition to more
specialized methods from external libraries. We hope that this new paradigm and
its first implementation can help unify and accelerate research in CL. You can

                    <span>We propose Neural Actor (NA), a new method for high-quality synthesis of
humans from arbitrary viewpoints and under arbitrary controllable poses. Our
method is built upon recent neural scene representation and rendering works
which learn representations of geometry and appearance from only 2D images.
While existing works demonstrated compelling rendering of static scenes and
playback of dynamic scenes, photo-realistic reconstruction and rendering of
humans with neural implicit methods, in particular under user-controlled novel
poses, is still difficult. To address this problem, we utilize a coarse body
model as the proxy to unwarp the surrounding 3D space into a canonical pose. A
neural radiance field learns pose-dependent geometric deformations and pose-
and view-dependent appearance effects in the canonical space from multi-view
video input. To synthesize novel views of high fidelity dynamic geometry and
appearance, we leverage 2D texture maps defined on the body model as latent
variables for predicting residual deformations and the dynamic appearance.
Experiments demonstrate that our method achieves better quality than the
state-of-the-arts on playback as well as novel pose synthesis, and can even
generalize well to new poses that starkly differ from the training poses.
Furthermore, our method also supports body shape control of the synthesized
results.</span>

                    <span>We address the problem of monitoring a set of binary stochastic processes and
generating an alert when the number of anomalies among them exceeds a
threshold. For this, the decision-maker selects and probes a subset of the
processes to obtain noisy estimates of their states (normal or anomalous).
Based on the received observations, the decisionmaker first determines whether
to declare that the number of anomalies has exceeded the threshold or to
continue taking observations. When the decision is to continue, it then decides
whether to collect observations at the next time instant or defer it to a later
time. If it chooses to collect observations, it further determines the subset
of processes to be probed. To devise this three-step sequential decision-making
process, we use a Bayesian formulation wherein we learn the posterior
probability on the states of the processes. Using the posterior probability, we
construct a Markov decision process and solve it using deep actor-critic
reinforcement learning. Via numerical experiments, we demonstrate the superior
performance of our algorithm compared to the traditional model-based
algorithms.</span>

VA-OPE, which uses the estimated variance of the value function to reweight the

                    <span>Continuous-depth neural networks, such as the Neural Ordinary Differential
Equations (ODEs), have aroused a great deal of interest from the communities of
machine learning and data science in recent years, which bridge the connection
between deep neural networks and dynamical systems. In this article, we
introduce a new sort of continuous-depth neural network, called the Neural
Piecewise-Constant Delay Differential Equations (PCDDEs). Here, unlike the
recently proposed framework of the Neural Delay Differential Equations (DDEs),
we transform the single delay into the piecewise-constant delay(s). The Neural
PCDDEs with such a transformation, on one hand, inherit the strength of
universal approximating capability in Neural DDEs. On the other hand, the
Neural PCDDEs, leveraging the contributions of the information from the
multiple previous time steps, further promote the modeling capability without
augmenting the network dimension. With such a promotion, we show that the
Neural PCDDEs do outperform the several existing continuous-depth neural
frameworks on the one-dimensional piecewise-constant delay population dynamics
and real-world datasets, including MNIST, CIFAR10, and SVHN.</span>

                    <span>Learning to optimize the area under the receiver operating characteristics
curve (AUC) performance for imbalanced data has attracted much attention in
recent years. Although there have been several methods of AUC optimization,
scaling up AUC optimization is still an open issue due to its pairwise learning
style. Maximizing AUC in the large-scale dataset can be considered as a
non-convex and expensive problem. Inspired by the characteristic of pairwise
learning, the cheap AUC optimization task with a small-scale dataset sampled
from the large-scale dataset is constructed to promote the AUC accuracy of the
original, large-scale, and expensive AUC optimization task. This paper develops
an evolutionary multitasking framework (termed EMTAUC) to make full use of
information among the constructed cheap and expensive tasks to obtain higher
performance. In EMTAUC, one mission is to optimize AUC from the sampled
dataset, and the other is to maximize AUC from the original dataset. Moreover,
due to the cheap task containing limited knowledge, a strategy for dynamically
adjusting the data structure of inexpensive tasks is proposed to introduce more
knowledge into the multitasking AUC optimization environment. The performance
of the proposed method is evaluated on a series of binary classification
datasets. The experimental results demonstrate that EMTAUC is highly
competitive to single task methods and online methods. Supplementary materials

                    <span>Fusing regression coefficients into homogenous groups can unveil those
coefficients that share a common value within each group. Such groupwise
homogeneity reduces the intrinsic dimension of the parameter space and
unleashes sharper statistical accuracy. We propose and investigate a new
combinatorial grouping approach called $L_0$-Fusion that is amenable to mixed
integer optimization (MIO). On the statistical aspect, we identify a
fundamental quantity called grouping sensitivity that underpins the difficulty
of recovering the true groups. We show that $L_0$-Fusion achieves grouping
consistency under the weakest possible requirement of the grouping sensitivity:
if this requirement is violated, then the minimax risk of group
misspecification will fail to converge to zero. Moreover, we show that in the
high-dimensional regime, one can apply $L_0$-Fusion coupled with a sure
screening set of features without any essential loss of statistical efficiency,
while reducing the computational cost substantially. On the algorithmic aspect,
we provide a MIO formulation for $L_0$-Fusion along with a warm start strategy.
Simulation and real data analysis demonstrate that $L_0$-Fusion exhibits
superiority over its competitors in terms of grouping accuracy.</span>

                    <span>A successful deployment of drones provides an ideal solution for surveillance
systems. Using drones for surveillance can provide access to areas that may be
difficult or impossible to reach by humans or in-land vehicles gathering images
or video recordings of a specific target in their coverage. Therefore, we
introduces a data delivery drone to transfer collected surveillance data in
harsh communication conditions. This paper proposes a Myerson auction-based
asynchronous data delivery in an aerial distributed data platform in
surveillance systems taking battery limitation and long flight constraints into
account. In this paper, multiple delivery drones compete to offer data transfer
to a single fixed-location surveillance drone. Our proposed Myerson
auction-based algorithm, which uses the truthful second-price auction (SPA) as
a baseline, is to maximize the seller&#x27;s revenue while meeting several desirable
properties, i.e., individual rationality and incentive compatibility while
pursuing truthful operations. On top of these SPA-based operations, a deep
learning-based framework is additionally designed for delivery performance
improvements.</span>

generalization error of interpolators in an arbitrary hypothesis class in terms
of the class&#x27;s Gaussian width. Applying the generic bound to Euclidean norm
balls recovers the consistency result of Bartlett et al. (2020) for
minimum-norm interpolators, and confirms a prediction of Zhou et al. (2020) for
near-minimal-norm interpolators in the special case of Gaussian data. We
demonstrate the generality of the bound by applying it to the simplex,
obtaining a novel consistency result for minimum l1-norm interpolators (basis

                    <span>This paper deals with the following important research question.
Traditionally, the neural network employs non-linear activation functions
concatenated with linear operators to approximate a given physical phenomenon.
They &quot;fill the space&quot; with the concatenations of the activation functions and
linear operators and adjust their coefficients to approximate the physical
phenomena. We claim that it is better to &quot;fill the space&quot; with linear
combinations of smooth higher-order B-splines base functions as employed by
isogeometric analysis and utilize the neural networks to adjust the
coefficients of linear combinations. In other words, the possibilities of using
neural networks for approximating the B-spline base functions&#x27; coefficients and
by approximating the solution directly are evaluated. Solving differential
equations with neural networks has been proposed by Maziar Raissi et al. in
2017 by introducing Physics-informed Neural Networks (PINN), which naturally
encode underlying physical laws as prior information. Approximation of
coefficients using a function as an input leverages the well-known capability
of neural networks being universal function approximators. In essence, in the
PINN approach the network approximates the value of the given field at a given
point. We present an alternative approach, where the physcial quantity is
approximated as a linear combination of smooth B-spline basis functions, and
the neural network approximates the coefficients of B-splines. This research
compares results from the DNN approximating the coefficients of the linear
combination of B-spline basis functions, with the DNN approximating the
solution directly. We show that our approach is cheaper and more accurate when
approximating smooth physical fields.</span>

                    <span>Normalization techniques have become a basic component in modern
convolutional neural networks (ConvNets). In particular, many recent works
demonstrate that promoting the orthogonality of the weights helps train deep
models and improve robustness. For ConvNets, most existing methods are based on
penalizing or normalizing weight matrices derived from concatenating or
flattening the convolutional kernels. These methods often destroy or ignore the
benign convolutional structure of the kernels; therefore, they are often
expensive or impractical for deep ConvNets. In contrast, we introduce a simple
and efficient &quot;Convolutional Normalization&quot; (ConvNorm) method that can fully
exploit the convolutional structure in the Fourier domain and serve as a simple
plug-and-play module to be conveniently incorporated into any ConvNets. Our
method is inspired by recent work on preconditioning methods for convolutional
sparse coding and can effectively promote each layer&#x27;s channel-wise isometry.
Furthermore, we show that our ConvNorm can reduce the layerwise spectral norm
of the weight matrices and hence improve the Lipschitzness of the network,
leading to easier training and improved robustness for deep ConvNets. Applied
to classification under noise corruptions and generative adversarial network
(GAN), we show that the ConvNorm improves the robustness of common ConvNets
such as ResNet and the performance of GAN. We verify our findings via numerical
experiments on CIFAR and ImageNet.</span>

                    <span>We deal with Bayesian generative and discriminative classifiers. Given a
model distribution $p(x, y)$, with the observation $y$ and the target $x$, one
computes generative classifiers by firstly considering $p(x, y)$ and then using
the Bayes rule to calculate $p(x | y)$. A discriminative model is directly
given by $p(x | y)$, which is used to compute discriminative classifiers.
However, recent works showed that the Bayesian Maximum Posterior classifier
defined from the Naive Bayes (NB) or Hidden Markov Chain (HMC), both generative
models, can also match the discriminative classifier definition. Thus, there
are situations in which dividing classifiers into &quot;generative&quot; and
&quot;discriminative&quot; is somewhat misleading. Indeed, such a distinction is rather
related to the way of computing classifiers, not to the classifiers themselves.
We present a general theoretical result specifying how a generative classifier
induced from a generative model can also be computed in a discriminative way
from the same model. Examples of NB and HMC are found again as particular
cases, and we apply the general result to two original extensions of NB, and
two extensions of HMC, one of which being original. Finally, we shortly
illustrate the interest of the new discriminative way of computing classifiers
in the Natural Language Processing (NLP) framework.</span>

                    <span>Fluorescence microscopy has been a significant tool to observe long-term
imaging of embryos (in vivo) growth over time. However, cumulative exposure is
phototoxic to such sensitive live samples. While techniques like light-sheet
fluorescence microscopy (LSFM) allow for reduced exposure, it is not well
suited for deep imaging models. Other computational techniques are
computationally expensive and often lack restoration quality. To address this
challenge, one can use various low-dosage imaging techniques that are developed
to achieve the 3D volume reconstruction using a few slices in the axial
direction (z-axis); however, they often lack restoration quality. Also,
acquiring dense images (with small steps) in the axial direction is
computationally expensive. To address this challenge, we present a compressive
sensing (CS) based approach to fully reconstruct 3D volumes with the same
signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) with less than half of the excitation dosage. We
present the theory and experimentally validate the approach. To demonstrate our
technique, we capture a 3D volume of the RFP labeled neurons in the zebrafish
embryo spinal cord (30um thickness) with the axial sampling of 0.1um using a
confocal microscope. From the results, we observe the CS-based approach
achieves accurate 3D volume reconstruction from less than 20% of the entire
stack optical sections. The developed CS-based methodology in this work can be
easily applied to other deep imaging modalities such as two-photon and
light-sheet microscopy, where reducing sample photo-toxicity is a critical
challenge.</span>

                    <span>Location data collected from mobile devices represent mobility behaviors at
individual and societal levels. These data have important applications ranging
from transportation planning to epidemic modeling. However, issues must be
overcome to best serve these use cases: The data often represent a limited
sample of the population and use of the data jeopardizes privacy.

To address these issues, we present and evaluate a system for generating
synthetic mobility data using a deep recurrent neural network (RNN) which is
trained on real location data. The system takes a population distribution as
input and generates mobility traces for a corresponding synthetic population.

Related generative approaches have not solved the challenges of capturing
both the patterns and variability in individuals&#x27; mobility behaviors over
longer time periods, while also balancing the generation of realistic data with
privacy. Our system leverages RNNs&#x27; ability to generate complex and novel
sequences while retaining patterns from training data. Also, the model
introduces randomness used to calibrate the variation between the synthetic and
real data at the individual level. This is to both capture variability in human
mobility, and protect user privacy.

Location based services (LBS) data from more than 22,700 mobile devices were
used in an experimental evaluation across utility and privacy metrics. We show
the generated mobility data retain the characteristics of the real data, while
varying from the real data at the individual level, and where this amount of
variation matches the variation within the real data.</span>

                    <span>Deep neural networks (DNNs) are known to be vulnerable to adversarial
attacks. A range of defense methods have been proposed to train adversarially
robust DNNs, among which adversarial training has demonstrated promising
results. However, despite preliminary understandings developed for adversarial
training, it is still not clear, from the architectural perspective, what
configurations can lead to more robust DNNs. In this paper, we address this gap
via a comprehensive investigation on the impact of network width and depth on
the robustness of adversarially trained DNNs. Specifically, we make the
following key observations: 1) more parameters (higher model capacity) does not
necessarily help adversarial robustness; 2) reducing capacity at the last stage
(the last group of blocks) of the network can actually improve adversarial
robustness; and 3) under the same parameter budget, there exists an optimal
architectural configuration for adversarial robustness. We also provide a
theoretical analysis explaning why such network configuration can help
robustness. These architectural insights can help design adversarially robust
DNNs. Code is available at \url{https://github.com/HanxunH/RobustWRN}.</span>

of the class&#x27;s Gaussian width. Applying the generic bound to Euclidean norm
balls recovers the consistency result of Bartlett et al. (2020) for
minimum-norm interpolators, and confirms a prediction of Zhou et al. (2020) for
near-minimal-norm interpolators in the special case of Gaussian data. We
demonstrate the generality of the bound by applying it to the simplex,
obtaining a novel consistency result for minimum l1-norm interpolators (basis
pursuit). Our results show how norm-based generalization bounds can explain and
be used to analyze benign overfitting, at least in some settings.</span>

                    <span>The Sliced-Wasserstein distance (SW) is being increasingly used in machine
learning applications as an alternative to the Wasserstein distance and offers
significant computational and statistical benefits. Since it is defined as an
expectation over random projections, SW is commonly approximated by Monte
Carlo. We adopt a new perspective to approximate SW by making use of the
concentration of measure phenomenon: under mild assumptions, one-dimensional
projections of a high-dimensional random vector are approximately Gaussian.
Based on this observation, we develop a simple deterministic approximation for
SW. Our method does not require sampling a number of random projections, and is
therefore both accurate and easy to use compared to the usual Monte Carlo
approximation. We derive nonasymptotical guarantees for our approach, and show
that the approximation error goes to zero as the dimension increases, under a
weak dependence condition on the data distribution. We validate our theoretical
findings on synthetic datasets, and illustrate the proposed approximation on a
generative modeling problem.</span>

                    <span>Finding different solutions to the same problem is a key aspect of
intelligence associated with creativity and adaptation to novel situations. In
reinforcement learning, a set of diverse policies can be useful for
exploration, transfer, hierarchy, and robustness. We propose Diverse Successive
Policies, a method for discovering policies that are diverse in the space of
Successor Features, while assuring that they are near optimal. We formalize the
problem as a Constrained Markov Decision Process (CMDP) where the goal is to
find policies that maximize diversity, characterized by an intrinsic diversity
reward, while remaining near-optimal with respect to the extrinsic reward of
the MDP. We also analyze how recently proposed robustness and discrimination
rewards perform and find that they are sensitive to the initialization of the
procedure and may converge to sub-optimal solutions. To alleviate this, we
propose new explicit diversity rewards that aim to minimize the correlation
between the Successor Features of the policies in the set. We compare the
different diversity mechanisms in the DeepMind Control Suite and find that the
type of explicit diversity we are proposing is important to discover distinct
behavior, like for example different locomotion patterns.</span>

                    <span>Fusing regression coefficients into homogenous groups can unveil those
coefficients that share a common value within each group. Such groupwise
homogeneity reduces the intrinsic dimension of the parameter space and
unleashes sharper statistical accuracy. We propose and investigate a new
combinatorial grouping approach called $L_0$-Fusion that is amenable to mixed
integer optimization (MIO). On the statistical aspect, we identify a
fundamental quantity called grouping sensitivity that underpins the difficulty
of recovering the true groups. We show that $L_0$-Fusion achieves grouping
consistency under the weakest possible requirement of the grouping sensitivity:
if this requirement is violated, then the minimax risk of group
misspecification will fail to converge to zero. Moreover, we show that in the
high-dimensional regime, one can apply $L_0$-Fusion coupled with a sure
screening set of features without any essential loss of statistical efficiency,
while reducing the computational cost substantially. On the algorithmic aspect,
we provide a MIO formulation for $L_0$-Fusion along with a warm start strategy.
Simulation and real data analysis demonstrate that $L_0$-Fusion exhibits
superiority over its competitors in terms of grouping accuracy.</span>

                    <span>Clinical 12-lead electrocardiography (ECG) is one of the most widely
encountered kinds of biosignals. Despite the increased availability of public
ECG datasets, label scarcity remains a central challenge in the field.
Self-supervised learning represents a promising way to alleviate this issue. In
this work, we put forward the first comprehensive assessment of self-supervised
representation learning from clinical 12-lead ECG data. To this end, we adapt
state-of-the-art self-supervised methods based on instance discrimination and
latent forecasting to the ECG domain. In a first step, we learn contrastive
representations and evaluate their quality based on linear evaluation
performance on a recently established, comprehensive, clinical ECG
classification task. In a second step, we analyze the impact of self-supervised
pretraining on finetuned ECG classifiers as compared to purely supervised
performance. For the best-performing method, an adaptation of contrastive
predictive coding, we find a linear evaluation performance only 0.5% below
supervised performance. For the finetuned models, we find improvements in
downstream performance of roughly 1% compared to supervised performance, label
efficiency, as well as robustness against physiological noise. This work
clearly establishes the feasibility of extracting discriminative
representations from ECG data via self-supervised learning and the numerous
advantages when finetuning such representations on downstream tasks as compared
to purely supervised training. As first comprehensive assessment of its kind in
the ECG domain carried out exclusively on publicly available datasets, we hope
to establish a first step towards reproducible progress in the rapidly evolving
field of representation learning for biosignals.</span>

                    <span>Kendall transformation is a conversion of an ordered feature into a vector of
pairwise order relations between individual values. This way, it preserves
ranking of observations and represents it in a categorical form.

Such transformation allows for generalisation of methods requiring strictly
categorical input, especially in the limit of small number of observations,
when discretisation becomes problematic. In particular, many approaches of
information theory can be directly applied to Kendall-transformed continuous
data without relying on differential entropy or any additional parameters.
Moreover, by filtering information to this contained in ranking, Kendall
transformation leads to a better robustness at a reasonable cost of dropping
sophisticated interactions which are anyhow unlikely to be correctly estimated.

In bivariate analysis, Kendall transformation can be related to popular

                    <span>We deal with Bayesian generative and discriminative classifiers. Given a
model distribution $p(x, y)$, with the observation $y$ and the target $x$, one
computes generative classifiers by firstly considering $p(x, y)$ and then using
the Bayes rule to calculate $p(x | y)$. A discriminative model is directly
given by $p(x | y)$, which is used to compute discriminative classifiers.
However, recent works showed that the Bayesian Maximum Posterior classifier
defined from the Naive Bayes (NB) or Hidden Markov Chain (HMC), both generative
models, can also match the discriminative classifier definition. Thus, there
are situations in which dividing classifiers into &quot;generative&quot; and
&quot;discriminative&quot; is somewhat misleading. Indeed, such a distinction is rather
related to the way of computing classifiers, not to the classifiers themselves.
We present a general theoretical result specifying how a generative classifier
induced from a generative model can also be computed in a discriminative way
from the same model. Examples of NB and HMC are found again as particular
cases, and we apply the general result to two original extensions of NB, and
two extensions of HMC, one of which being original. Finally, we shortly
illustrate the interest of the new discriminative way of computing classifiers
in the Natural Language Processing (NLP) framework.</span>

                    <span>Recently, surface electromyogram (EMG) has been proposed as a novel biometric
trait for addressing some key limitations of current biometrics, such as
spoofing and liveness. The EMG signals possess a unique characteristic: they
are inherently different for individuals (biometrics), and they can be
customized to realize multi-length codes or passwords (for example, by
performing different gestures). However, current EMG-based biometric research
has two critical limitations: 1) a small subject pool, compared to other more
established biometric traits, and 2) limited to single-session or single-day
data sets. In this study, forearm and wrist EMG data were collected from 43
participants over three different days with long separation while they
performed static hand and wrist gestures. The multi-day biometric
authentication resulted in a median EER of 0.017 for the forearm setup and
0.025 for the wrist setup, comparable to well-established biometric traits
suggesting consistent performance over multiple days. The presented
large-sample multi-day data set and findings could facilitate further research
on EMG-based biometrics and other gesture recognition-based applications.</span>

                    <span>Statistical divergences (SDs), which quantify the dissimilarity between
probability distributions, are a basic constituent of statistical inference and
machine learning. A modern method for estimating those divergences relies on
parametrizing an empirical variational form by a neural network (NN) and
optimizing over parameter space. Such neural estimators are abundantly used in
practice, but corresponding performance guarantees are partial and call for
further exploration. In particular, there is a fundamental tradeoff between the
two sources of error involved: approximation and empirical estimation. While
the former needs the NN class to be rich and expressive, the latter relies on
controlling complexity. We explore this tradeoff for an estimator based on a
shallow NN by means of non-asymptotic error bounds, focusing on four popular
$\mathsf{f}$-divergences -- Kullback-Leibler, chi-squared, squared Hellinger,
and total variation. Our analysis relies on non-asymptotic function
approximation theorems and tools from empirical process theory. The bounds
reveal the tension between the NN size and the number of samples, and enable to
characterize scaling rates thereof that ensure consistency. For compactly
supported distributions, we further show that neural estimators of the first
three divergences above with appropriate NN growth-rate are near minimax
rate-optimal, achieving the parametric rate up to logarithmic factors.</span>

                    <span>We study the class of first-order locally-balanced Metropolis--Hastings
algorithms introduced in Livingstone &amp; Zanella (2021). To choose a specific
algorithm within the class the user must select a balancing function
$g:\mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$ satisfying $g(t) &#x3D; tg(1/t)$, and a noise
distribution for the proposal increment. Popular choices within the class are
the Metropolis-adjusted Langevin algorithm and the recently introduced Barker
proposal. We first establish a universal limiting optimal acceptance rate of
57% and scaling of $n^{-1/3}$ as the dimension $n$ tends to infinity among all
members of the class under mild smoothness assumptions on $g$ and when the
target distribution for the algorithm is of the product form. In particular we
obtain an explicit expression for the asymptotic efficiency of an arbitrary
algorithm in the class, as measured by expected squared jumping distance. We
then consider how to optimise this expression under various constraints. We
derive an optimal choice of noise distribution for the Barker proposal, optimal
choice of balancing function under a Gaussian noise distribution, and optimal
choice of first-order locally-balanced algorithm among the entire class, which
turns out to depend on the specific target distribution. Numerical simulations
confirm our theoretical findings and in particular show that a bi-modal choice
of noise distribution in the Barker proposal gives rise to a practical
algorithm that is consistently more efficient than the original Gaussian
version.</span>

                    <span>Recent advances in deep reinforcement learning (RL) have led to considerable
progress in many 2-player zero-sum games, such as Go, Poker and Starcraft. The
purely adversarial nature of such games allows for conceptually simple and
principled application of RL methods. However real-world settings are
many-agent, and agent interactions are complex mixtures of common-interest and
competitive aspects. We consider Diplomacy, a 7-player board game designed to
accentuate dilemmas resulting from many-agent interactions. It also features a
large combinatorial action space and simultaneous moves, which are challenging
for RL algorithms. We propose a simple yet effective approximate best response
operator, designed to handle large combinatorial action spaces and simultaneous
moves. We also introduce a family of policy iteration methods that approximate
fictitious play. With these methods, we successfully apply RL to Diplomacy: we
show that our agents convincingly outperform the previous state-of-the-art, and
game theoretic equilibrium analysis shows that the new process yields
consistent improvements.</span>

                    <span>Community detection is one of the most important methodological fields of
network science, and one which has attracted a significant amount of attention
over the past decades. This area deals with the automated division of a network
into fundamental building blocks, with the objective of providing a summary of
its large-scale structure. Despite its importance and widespread adoption,
there is a noticeable gap between what is considered the state-of-the-art and
the methods that are actually used in practice in a variety of fields. Here we
attempt to address this discrepancy by dividing existing methods according to
whether they have a &quot;descriptive&quot; or an &quot;inferential&quot; goal. While descriptive
methods find patterns in networks based on intuitive notions of community
structure, inferential methods articulate a precise generative model, and
attempt to fit it to data. In this way, they are able to provide insights into
the mechanisms of network formation, and separate structure from randomness in
a manner supported by statistical evidence. We review how employing descriptive
methods with inferential aims is riddled with pitfalls and misleading answers,
and thus should be in general avoided. We argue that inferential methods are
more typically aligned with clearer scientific questions, yield more robust
results, and should be in many cases preferred. We attempt to dispel some myths
and half-truths often believed when community detection is employed in
practice, in an effort to improve both the use of such methods as well as the
interpretation of their results.</span>

                    <span>The literature on robustness towards common corruptions shows no consensus on
whether adversarial training can improve the performance in this setting.
First, we show that, when used with an appropriately selected perturbation
radius, $\ell_p$ adversarial training can serve as a strong baseline against
common corruptions improving both accuracy and calibration. Then we explain why
adversarial training performs better than data augmentation with simple
Gaussian noise which has been observed to be a meaningful baseline on common
corruptions. Related to this, we identify the $\sigma$-overfitting phenomenon
when Gaussian augmentation overfits to a particular standard deviation used for
training which has a significant detrimental effect on common corruption
accuracy. We discuss how to alleviate this problem and then how to further
enhance $\ell_p$ adversarial training by introducing an efficient relaxation of
adversarial training with learned perceptual image patch similarity as the
distance metric. Through experiments on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet-100, we show that
our approach does not only improve the $\ell_p$ adversarial training baseline
but also has cumulative gains with data augmentation methods such as AugMix,
DeepAugment, ANT, and SIN, leading to state-of-the-art performance on common
corruptions.

                    <span>The effect of bias on hypothesis formation is characterized for an automated
data-driven projection pursuit neural network to extract and select features
for binary classification of data streams. This intelligent exploratory process
partitions a complete vector state space into disjoint subspaces to create
working hypotheses quantified by similarities and differences observed between
two groups of labeled data streams. Data streams are typically time sequenced,
and may exhibit complex spatio-temporal patterns. For example, given atomic
trajectories from molecular dynamics simulation, the machine&#x27;s task is to
quantify dynamical mechanisms that promote function by comparing protein
mutants, some known to function while others are nonfunctional. Utilizing
synthetic two-dimensional molecules that mimic the dynamics of functional and
nonfunctional proteins, biases are identified and controlled in both the
machine learning model and selected training data under different contexts. The
refinement of a working hypothesis converges to a statistically robust
multivariate perception of the data based on a context-dependent perspective.
Including diverse perspectives during data exploration enhances
interpretability of the multivariate characterization of similarities and
differences.</span>

Such approaches cannot scale to a wide range of items in the wild. BANMo is a technique that does not need a specialized sensor or a pre-defined template form. In a differentiable rendering framework, BANMo generates high-fidelity, articulated 3D models (including state and animatable skinning weights) from a large number of monocular casual films. While the usage of several films increases coverage of camera perspectives and object articulations, it introduces significant issues in establishing correlation across scenes with diverse backdrops, lighting conditions, etc. Continue Reading

                    <span>If there is a training data which consists of pair of image and corresponding textual explanation of that image. How to represent this Semantic knowledge between image and corresponding textual meaning in AI model. So that we don&#x27;t need much of training data, if I can infuse that knowledge between image and text pair. Idea is to infuse this knowledge and then at inference time, if such image appears then perform action. Ex- If there is a image and respective meaning is &#x27;open the door&#x27;, then if robot sees that image at inference it will open the door. I am thinking of NLP based model to infuse this knowledge, but not sure how BERT like model can be employed in this situation.
 Is there existing SOTA which addresses this kind of issues?

                    <span>Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have been one of the main hypes of recent years. Based on the famous generator-discriminator mechanism, their very simple functioning has driven the research to continuously improve the former architecture. The peak in image generation has been reached by StyleGANs, which can produce astonishingly realistic and high-quality images, able to fool even humans. 
 While the generation of new samples has achieved excellent results in the 2D domain, 3D GANs are still highly inefficient. If the exact mechanism of 2D GANs is applied in the 3D environment, the computational effort is too high since 3D data is tough to manipulate for current GPUs. For this reason, the research has focused on how to construct geometry-aware GANs that can infer the underline 3D property using solely 2D images. But, in this case, the approximations are usually not 3D consistent. Continue Reading The Paper Summary

                    <span>Imagine 10 cameras, running 24/7 at 30 FPS - that&#x27;s 27 million frames generated in a single day. Knowing what&#x27;s in that data or finding the 1% of things that are actually interesting is hard. I genuinely think there&#x27;s way too little attention put forth to how people should use their raw data effectively even though so many people choose to store petabytes of it, just in case.
 I wrote a little article about taking raw video and turning that into an actionable computer vision model. Would love to have a technical discussion about this so comment away :)

                    <span>Hello all,
 I&#x27;m currently working on a project where I&#x27;m trying to perform key information extraction (KIE) and classification on rental property operating statements. My plan is to pre-train a model on a similar dataset (e.g. [IBM FinTabNet](https://developer.ibm.com/exchanges/data/all/fintabnet/), etc.) and then fine-tune on a custom dataset I&#x27;m creating. My task is to:
  
Identify the key:value pairs associated with each line item for each period in the statement. So for example, for the first line item, we&#x27;d have a 3-tuple of (&#x27;Rent income&#x27;, &#x27;Nov 2020&#x27;, 21,428.03)
 Identify the key:value pairs associated with the total for each line item in the statement. So for example, for the first line item, we&#x27;d have a 3-tuple of (&#x27;Rent income&#x27;, &#x27;Total&#x27;, 322,872.36)

                    <span>Sparsest cut, and its close variant &quot;balanced cut&quot;, have been studied for ages in the computer science theory community, and there are algorithms to compute this which run fast. Sparsest cut is often billed as a &quot;graph clustering&quot; algorithm. 
 Sparsest cut gives rise to an obvious data clustering algorithm: build a graph on your data (like kNN or threshold graph), and run sparsest cut to get a 2-way partition. To do a k-way partition, you could recursively do this. From what I know, sparsest cut intuition is one thing that guided the creation of spectral clustering, a widely used clustering method. 
 HHas anyone tried implementing this in practice? If so, how does it do on data? If not, why not? I have searched extensively on Google for any implementations of this sparsest-cut style clustering, but I haven&#x27;t found any. Given that sparsest cut is one of the most well-studied problems in computer theory, I was surprised that no implementation of this clustering method exists.

 Are model extraction attacks a problem here at all? How does one protect their IP? I heard of people watermarking their models, but I am not sure how such techniques in their current form would fare in court.

                    <span>Hi all,
 I&#x27;m using a Yolov5 model to make inferences and noticed that it was faster at inferring 320x320 images (~0.25s/image) compared to 288x288 images (~0.45s/image). When I disabled test time augmentation, the gap closed, and both image sizes are inferred at ~0.084s/image. Any ideas why augmenting a smaller image size is slower than augmenting a faster image size?

 Hey r/ML, some of you might have heard about MDLI – short for Machine &amp; Deep Learning Israel. It&#x27;s an independent Israeli community (over 25K members) for professionals in data science and ML, and they are having a conference for everyone (in English), in just 14 days.
 You can register here https://machinelearning.co.il/mdli-ops-2022/
 I know that sometimes these free events tend to feel like commercials, but you should really check out the agenda. Some of the talks are going to be by ML teams at companies like AppsFlyer and BigPanda, explaining how they built their internal stacks and ML systems.
 There&#x27;s also a super interesting talk by the NVIDIA team, where they will talk about building supercomputers to train ML models on them. This one seems crazy awesome to me.
 It&#x27;s also a good opportunity to listen to offerings by some cool ML startups, which might give you a better understanding of how they compare, and what you actually care about when choosing MLOps tools.
 The organizers will probably be here in the comments if you have any questions, but in my opinion, every event this community organizes is really awesome, and I get to learn a lot, so I really recommend this.

                    <span>Hey everyone!
 I wanted to share with you an open-source tool we&#x27;ve been building for a while. Deepchecks is an open-source tool for validating &amp; testing models and data efficiently:
 https://github.com/deepchecks/deepchecks
 Deepchecks is a python package, implementing validations and tests needed in order to trust an ML pipeline. It contains many built-in checks, such as verifying the data integrity, inspecting its distributions, validating data splits, evaluating your model, and comparing between different models.
 In addition, it contains test suites, similar to the test suites in software programs, that can accompany you through all building blocks of the ML pipeline development. Each test suite contains checks necessary for the specific part in the pipeline.
 The suite result looks something like this:
 ​
 Suite result
 The suites and checks have a simple syntax and are highly customizable.
 If you want to jump right in, you can try it out in the quick start notebook:
 https://docs.deepchecks.com/en/stable/examples/guides/quickstart_in_5_minutes.html 
 What do you think? I’ll be happy to hear your thoughts and feedback.

                    <span>I have tried using a few pre-loaded architectures in Tensorflow including tf.keras.applications.efficientnet.EfficientNetB3
 and tf.keras.applications.MobileNetV3Large
 . I am working on medical images so I am not any pretrained ImageNet weights. I manage to reach a decent accuracy during the training epoch (eg 75%), but my validation accuracy doesn&#x27;t cross random performance (eg 3%). Upon closer inspection I have identified the cause as being the batch normalization layers - If I run the evaluation batches w/ training&#x3D;True
 on the BatchNorm layers, I am able to reproduce the training set accuracy. I have tried playing with the momentum parameter and changing it from its default value of .999 to .75 or even .5 but with no effect.
 My question is what may be causing this and how can I fix it? 
 On a larger note, do most people find that they can use pre-loaded architectures out-of-the-box or are there various parameters that they need to modify to get it to work properly?

                    <span>Example: If i trained a neural net on my own pinterest board full of manga/illustration style artwork - with a rough theme (fantasy/sci-fi/wizard type characters) could the neural net then be able to output random variations of these?
 If no - what would it take?
 Sorry if im thinking about this the wrong way,
 i&#x27;m still new to this.

                    <span>I have made rudimentary ANN before but keep looking for ways to push my boundaries. I like AI and flight sims so why not an AI that helps me flight sim. :)
 I&#x27;m thinking of an ANN assistant (eg co-pilot) that learns to do key actions during flight.
 Inputs:
  
On ground (Boolean)
 
Altitude (numerical - normalised)
 
Pitch (nose up/down/level)
 
 Outputs:
  
Gear (up/down)
 Autopilot (on/off)
 Flaps (up/down)
 Lights (on/off)
  
So, given the state of the aircraft at any given point, the ANN can manipulate (or recommend) the configuration of the aircraft and lighten the pilot work load (remembering this is a fun exercise).
 Assume my ANN can monitor and manipulate the flight sim (it has an interface to do this), is an ANN with appropriate weights and nodes a good fit (after training)?
 Should I be looking at Q-Table or something else?

                    <span>Im new to 3dCNN. Is it possible to use 3dCNN for action classification (like sitting, walking?) I have temperature data in csv this data can be turned into 16x16x4 images (RBG to show temp in different colors). 
 My question is, do i need to turn each frame into an image? To then be turned into a video in order to feed it into the 3dCNN? If so, how can i optimize this? 1 action has several frames in the same csv file, and I have several files. 
 Or can i just use temperature data in csv straight away? (Each file contains one action with several frames worth of temp data)
 Any help /links/ examples are greatly appreciated.

                    <span>Hi all,
 I implemented PPO using PyTorch here. As is suggested, I was trying it on very simple environment (CartPole-v1).
 My PPO doesn&#x27;t seem to be very impressive. The reward seems to saturate somewhere around 25, while the best it can go is around 190s. Here is benchmark of all my experiments. There exist various implementations with various set of hyperparameters, and other improvement choices (Advantage using GAE, Clip critic loss, and so on). I have tried various mix of them, but sadly nothing seems to improve it.
 The various resources I have referred are:

 Can you help me getting it trained on this simple environment.I have implemented it in a way that it should be easy to run and understand.

                    <span>Hello everybody!
 One implementation detail of PPO is to normalize the advantage estimates. These are usually normalized using the mean and std so that the mean is 0 and the std is 1. Now, I came across 3 different implementations that apply the normalization to different amounts of data. More precisely:
  
Normalizing advantages across single episodes (kamarl)
 Normalizing advantages across single mini batches (neroRL)
 Normalizing advantages across the entire batch (SpinningUp)
  
Do you guys think that this detail has a higher impact?
 My first intuition is that the more data is used for normalization, the smoother the normalized advantages are. So when normalizing across single episodes, this could lead to a high variance causing harmfully large parameter updates, whereas the smooth normalization could hinder learning.

                    <span>Hi everyone - I am a data scientist who works a lot on causal inference problems. In particular, I build individual treatment effect (AKA Conditional Average Treatment Effects AKA Uplift) models to estimate the causal effect of some potential treatment(s) on an outcome of interest for an individual for the express purpose of giving the optimal &quot;treatment&quot; to a given individual. &quot;Optimal&quot; usually means the treatment that is estimated to cause the largest positive effect on the outcome. A typical example is optimizing marketing touches for individual customers: we have several &quot;treatments&quot; we can apply to a customer at a given time, such as targeting them for an online ad campaign, sending a push notification through our app, sending a marketing email, etc. and we want to make sure we are pu…</span>

                    <span>In the hospital setting, a small percentage of recurrent frequent patients
contribute to a disproportional amount of healthcare resource usage. Moreover,
in many of these cases, patient outcomes can be greatly improved by reducing
reoccurring visits, especially when they are associated with substance abuse,
mental health, and medical factors that could be improved by social-behavioral
interventions, outpatient or preventative care. Additionally, health care costs
can be reduced significantly with fewer preventable recurrent visits.

To address this, we developed a computationally efficient and interpretable
framework that both identifies recurrent patients with high utilization and
determines which comorbidities contribute most to their recurrent visits.
Specifically, we present a novel algorithm, called the minimum similarity
association rules (MSAR), balancing confidence-support trade-off, to determine
the conditions most associated with reoccurring Emergency department (ED) and
inpatient visits. We validate MSAR on a large Electric Health Record (EHR)
dataset.</span>

                    <span>Fine-grained IP geolocation systems often rely on some linear delay-distance
rules. They are not easy to generalize in network environments where the
delay-distance relationship is non-linear. Recently, researchers begin to pay
attention to learning-based IP geolocation systems. These data-driven
algorithms leverage multi-layer perceptron (MLP) to model non-linear
relationships. However, MLP is not so suitable for modeling computer networks
because networks are fundamentally graph-typed data. MLP-based IP geolocation
systems only treat IP addresses as isolated data instances, forgoing the
connection information between IP addresses. This would lead to sub-optimal
representations and limit the geolocation performance.

Graph convolutional network (GCN) is an emerging deep learning method for
graph-typed data presentation. In this work, we research how to model computer
networks for fine-grained IP geolocation with GCN. First, we formulate the IP
geolocation task as an attributed graph node regression problem. Then, a
GCN-based IP geolocation system named GCN-Geo is proposed to predict the
location of each IP address. GCN-Geo consists of a preprocessor, an encoder,
graph convolutional (GC) layers and a decoder. The preprocessor and the encoder
transform raw measurement data into the initial graph embeddings. GC layers
refine the initial graph node embeddings by explicitly modeling the connection
information between IP addresses. The proposed decoder can relieve the
converging problem of GCN-Geo by considering some prior knowledge about target
IP addresses. Finally, the experimental results in three real-world datasets
show that: GCN-Geo clearly outperforms the state-of-art rule-based and
learning-based baselines on all three datasets w.r.t. average, median and max
error distances. This work verifies the potential of GCN in fine-grained IP
geolocation.</span>

                    <span>Logs are widely used to record runtime information of software systems, such
as the timestamp and the importance of an event, the unique ID of the source of
the log, and a part of the state of a task&#x27;s execution. The rich information of
logs enables system developers (and operators) to monitor the runtime behaviors
of their systems and further track down system problems and perform analysis on
log data in production settings. However, the prior research on utilizing logs
is scattered and that limits the ability of new researchers in this field to
quickly get to the speed and hampers currently active researchers to advance
this field further. Therefore, this paper surveys and provides a systematic
literature review and mapping of the contemporary logging practices and log
statements&#x27; mining and monitoring techniques and their applications such as in
system failure detection and diagnosis. We study a large number of conference
and journal papers that appeared on top-level peer-reviewed venues.
Additionally, we draw high-level trends of ongoing research and categorize
publications into subdivisions. In the end, and based on our holistic
observations during this survey, we provide a set of challenges and

services. Physicians need images from various medical devices, and patients
medical history and physical examination to diagnose these fractures correctly
and apply proper treatment. This study aims to perform fracture detection using
deep learning on wrist Xray images to assist physicians not specialized in the
field, working in emergency services in particular, in diagnosis of fractures.
For this purpose, 20 different detection procedures were performed using deep
learning based object detection models on dataset of wrist Xray images obtained
from Gazi University Hospital. DCN, Dynamic R_CNN, Faster R_CNN, FSAF, Libra
R_CNN, PAA, RetinaNet, RegNet and SABL deep learning based object detection
models with various backbones were used herein. To further improve detection
procedures in the study, 5 different ensemble models were developed, which were
later used to reform an ensemble model to develop a detection model unique to
our study, titled wrist fracture detection combo (WFD_C). Based on 26 different
models for fracture detection, the highest result of detection was 0.8639

The problem is that the users lose control over potentially privacy sensitive
data. With homomorphic encryption (HE) computation can be performed on
encrypted data without revealing its content. In this systematization of
knowledge, we take an in-depth look at approaches that combine neural networks
with HE for privacy preservation. We categorize the changes to neural network

                    <span>Class Incremental Learning (CIL) aims at learning a multi-class classifier in
a phase-by-phase manner, in which only data of a subset of the classes are
provided at each phase. Previous works mainly focus on mitigating forgetting in
phases after the initial one. However, we find that improving CIL at its
initial phase is also a promising direction. Specifically, we experimentally
show that directly encouraging CIL Learner at the initial phase to output
similar representations as the model jointly trained on all classes can greatly
boost the CIL performance. Motivated by this, we study the difference between a
na\&quot;ively-trained initial-phase model and the oracle model. Specifically, since
one major difference between these two models is the number of training
classes, we investigate how such difference affects the model representations.
We find that, with fewer training classes, the data representations of each
class lie in a long and narrow region; with more training classes, the
representations of each class scatter more uniformly. Inspired by this
observation, we propose Class-wise Decorrelation (CwD) that effectively
regularizes representations of each class to scatter more uniformly, thus
mimicking the model jointly trained with all classes (i.e., the oracle model).
Our CwD is simple to implement and easy to plug into existing methods.
Extensive experiments on various benchmark datasets show that CwD consistently
and significantly improves the performance of existing state-of-the-art methods
by around 1\% to 3\%. Code will be released.</span>

                    <span>The Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture is showing promising results in
improving parameter sharing in multi-task learning (MTL) and in scaling
high-capacity neural networks. State-of-the-art MoE models use a trainable
sparse gate to select a subset of the experts for each input example. While
conceptually appealing, existing sparse gates, such as Top-k, are not smooth.
The lack of smoothness can lead to convergence and statistical performance
issues when training with gradient-based methods. In this paper, we develop
DSelect-k: a continuously differentiable and sparse gate for MoE, based on a
novel binary encoding formulation. The gate can be trained using first-order
methods, such as stochastic gradient descent, and offers explicit control over
the number of experts to select. We demonstrate the effectiveness of DSelect-k
on both synthetic and real MTL datasets with up to $128$ tasks. Our experiments
indicate that DSelect-k can achieve statistically significant improvements in
prediction and expert selection over popular MoE gates. Notably, on a
real-world, large-scale recommender system, DSelect-k achieves over $22\%$
improvement in predictive performance compared to Top-k. We provide an
open-source implementation of DSelect-k.</span>

                    <span>Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) is a fundamental structure in deep learning.
Recently, some works study the training process of over-parameterized neural
networks, and show that over-parameterized networks can learn functions in some
notable concept classes with a provable generalization error bound. In this
paper, we analyze the training and generalization for RNNs with random
initialization, and provide the following improvements over recent works:

1) For a RNN with input sequence $x&#x3D;(X_1,X_2,...,X_L)$, previous works study
to learn functions that are summation of $f(\beta^T_lX_l)$ and require
normalized conditions that $||X_l||\leq\epsilon$ with some very small
$\epsilon$ depending on the complexity of $f$. In this paper, using detailed
analysis about the neural tangent kernel matrix, we prove a generalization
error bound to learn such functions without normalized conditions and show that
some notable concept classes are learnable with the numbers of iterations and
samples scaling almost-polynomially in the input length $L$.

2) Moreover, we prove a novel result to learn N-variables functions of input
sequence with the form $f(\beta^T[X_{l_1},...,X_{l_N}])$, which do not belong
to the &quot;additive&quot; concept class, i,e., the summation of function $f(X_l)$. And
we show that when either $N$ or $l_0&#x3D;\max(l_1,..,l_N)-\min(l_1,..,l_N)$ is
small, $f(\beta^T[X_{l_1},...,X_{l_N}])$ will be learnable with the number
iterations and samples scaling almost-polynomially in the input length $L$.</span>

                    <span>In Federated Learning, a common approach for aggregating local models across
clients is periodic averaging of the full model parameters. It is, however,
known that different layers of neural networks can have a different degree of
model discrepancy across the clients. The conventional full aggregation scheme
does not consider such a difference and synchronizes the whole model parameters
at once, resulting in inefficient network bandwidth consumption. Aggregating
the parameters that are similar across the clients does not make meaningful
training progress while increasing the communication cost. We propose FedLAMA,
a layer-wise model aggregation scheme for scalable Federated Learning. FedLAMA
adaptively adjusts the aggregation interval in a layer-wise manner, jointly
considering the model discrepancy and the communication cost. The layer-wise
aggregation method enables to finely control the aggregation interval to relax
the aggregation frequency without a significant impact on the model accuracy.
Our empirical study shows that FedLAMA reduces the communication cost by up to
60% for IID data and 70% for non-IID data while achieving a comparable accuracy
to FedAvg.</span>

                    <span>Shared autonomy refers to approaches for enabling an autonomous agent to
collaborate with a human with the aim of improving human performance. However,
besides improving performance, it may often also be beneficial that the agent
concurrently accounts for preserving the user&#x27;s experience or satisfaction of
collaboration. In order to address this additional goal, we examine approaches
for improving the user experience by constraining the number of interventions
by the autonomous agent. We propose two model-free reinforcement learning
methods that can account for both hard and soft constraints on the number of
interventions. We show that not only does our method outperform the existing
baseline, but also eliminates the need to manually tune a black-box
hyperparameter for controlling the level of assistance. We also provide an
in-depth analysis of intervention scenarios in order to further illuminate
system understanding.</span>

                    <span>Federated learning enables multiple users to build a joint model by sharing
their model updates (gradients), while their raw data remains local on their
devices. In contrast to the common belief that this provides privacy benefits,
we here add to the very recent results on privacy risks when sharing gradients.
Specifically, we investigate Label Leakage from Gradients (LLG), a novel attack
to extract the labels of the users&#x27; training data from their shared gradients.
The attack exploits the direction and magnitude of gradients to determine the
presence or absence of any label. LLG is simple yet effective, capable of
leaking potential sensitive information represented by labels, and scales well
to arbitrary batch sizes and multiple classes. We mathematically and
empirically demonstrate the validity of the attack under different settings.
Moreover, empirical results show that LLG successfully extracts labels with
high accuracy at the early stages of model training. We also discuss different
defense mechanisms against such leakage. Our findings suggest that gradient
compression is a practical technique to mitigate the attack.</span>

                    <span>We study reinforcement learning (RL) with linear function approximation under
the adaptivity constraint. We consider two popular limited adaptivity models:
the batch learning model and the rare policy switch model, and propose two
efficient online RL algorithms for episodic linear Markov decision processes,
where the transition probability and the reward function can be represented as
a linear function of some known feature mapping. In specific, for the batch
learning model, our proposed LSVI-UCB-Batch algorithm achieves an $\tilde
O(\sqrt{d^3H^3T} + dHT/B)$ regret, where $d$ is the dimension of the feature
mapping, $H$ is the episode length, $T$ is the number of interactions and $B$
is the number of batches. Our result suggests that it suffices to use only
$\sqrt{T/dH}$ batches to obtain $\tilde O(\sqrt{d^3H^3T})$ regret. For the rare
policy switch model, our proposed LSVI-UCB-RareSwitch algorithm enjoys an
$\tilde O(\sqrt{d^3H^3T[1+T/(dH)]^{dH/B}})$ regret, which implies that $dH\log
T$ policy switches suffice to obtain the $\tilde O(\sqrt{d^3H^3T})$ regret. Our
algorithms achieve the same regret as the LSVI-UCB algorithm (Jin et al.,
2019), yet with a substantially smaller amount of adaptivity. We also establish
a lower bound for the batch learning model, which suggests that the dependency
on $B$ in our regret bound is tight.</span>

                    <span>Deep neural networks (DNNs) have shown superior performances on various
multimodal learning problems. However, it often requires huge efforts to adapt
DNNs to individual multimodal tasks by manually engineering unimodal features
and designing multimodal feature fusion strategies. This paper proposes Bilevel
Multimodal Neural Architecture Search (BM-NAS) framework, which makes the
architecture of multimodal fusion models fully searchable via a bilevel
searching scheme. At the upper level, BM-NAS selects the inter/intra-modal
feature pairs from the pretrained unimodal backbones. At the lower level,
BM-NAS learns the fusion strategy for each feature pair, which is a combination
of predefined primitive operations. The primitive operations are elaborately
designed and they can be flexibly combined to accommodate various effective
feature fusion modules such as multi-head attention (Transformer) and Attention
on Attention (AoA). Experimental results on three multimodal tasks demonstrate
the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed BM-NAS framework. BM-NAS
achieves competitive performances with much less search time and fewer model
parameters in comparison with the existing generalized multimodal NAS methods.</span>

Processes (MDPs) under the tabular setting. We propose a model-based algorithm

uncertainty principle} and the Bernstein-type bonus. We show that
UCBVI-$\gamma$ achieves an $\tilde{O}\big({\sqrt{SAT}}/{(1-\gamma)^{1.5}}\big)$
regret, where $S$ is the number of states, $A$ is the number of actions,
$\gamma$ is the discount factor and $T$ is the number of steps. In addition, we
construct a class of hard MDPs and show that for any algorithm, the expected
regret is at least $\tilde{\Omega}\big({\sqrt{SAT}}/{(1-\gamma)^{1.5}}\big)$.
Our upper bound matches the minimax lower bound up to logarithmic factors,

                    <span>Optimizing nonconvex (NCVX) problems, especially nonsmooth and constrained
ones, is an essential part of machine learning. However, it can be hard to
reliably solve such problems without optimization expertise. Existing
general-purpose NCVX optimization packages are powerful but typically cannot
handle nonsmoothness. GRANSO is among the first optimization solvers targeting
general nonsmooth NCVX problems with nonsmooth constraints, but, as it is
implemented in MATLAB and requires the user to provide analytical gradients,
GRANSO is often not a convenient choice in machine learning (especially deep
learning) applications. To greatly lower the technical barrier, we introduce a
new software package called NCVX, whose initial release contains the solver
PyGRANSO, a PyTorch-enabled port of GRANSO incorporating auto-differentiation,
GPU acceleration, tensor input, and support for new QP solvers. NCVX is built
on freely available and widely used open-source frameworks, and as a highlight,
can solve general constrained deep learning problems, the first of its kind.
NCVX is available at https://ncvx.org, with detailed documentation and numerous
examples from machine learning and other fields.</span>

                    <span>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have shown advantages in various graph-based
applications. Most existing GNNs assume strong homophily of graph structure and
apply permutation-invariant local aggregation of neighbors to learn a
representation for each node. However, they fail to generalize to heterophilic
graphs, where most neighboring nodes have different labels or features, and the
relevant nodes are distant. Few recent studies attempt to address this problem
by combining multiple hops of hidden representations of central nodes (i.e.,
multi-hop-based approaches) or sorting the neighboring nodes based on attention
scores (i.e., ranking-based approaches). As a result, these approaches have
some apparent limitations. On the one hand, multi-hop-based approaches do not
explicitly distinguish relevant nodes from a large number of multi-hop
neighborhoods, leading to a severe over-smoothing problem. On the other hand,
ranking-based models do not joint-optimize node ranking with end tasks and
result in sub-optimal solutions. In this work, we present Graph Pointer Neural
Networks (GPNN) to tackle the challenges mentioned above. We leverage a pointer
network to select the most relevant nodes from a large amount of multi-hop
neighborhoods, which constructs an ordered sequence according to the
relationship with the central node. 1D convolution is then applied to extract
high-level features from the node sequence. The pointer-network-based ranker in
GPNN is joint-optimized with other parts in an end-to-end manner. Extensive
experiments are conducted on six public node classification datasets with
heterophilic graphs. The results show that GPNN significantly improves the
classification performance of state-of-the-art methods. In addition, analyses
also reveal the privilege of the proposed GPNN in filtering out irrelevant
neighbors and reducing over-smoothing.</span>

                    <span>The study of generalisation in deep Reinforcement Learning (RL) aims to
produce RL algorithms whose policies generalise well to novel unseen situations
at deployment time, avoiding overfitting to their training environments.
Tackling this is vital if we are to deploy reinforcement learning algorithms in
real world scenarios, where the environment will be diverse, dynamic and
unpredictable. This survey is an overview of this nascent field. We provide a
unifying formalism and terminology for discussing different generalisation
problems, building upon previous works. We go on to categorise existing
benchmarks for generalisation, as well as current methods for tackling the
generalisation problem. Finally, we provide a critical discussion of the
current state of the field, including recommendations for future work. Among
other conclusions, we argue that taking a purely procedural content generation
approach to benchmark design is not conducive to progress in generalisation, we
suggest fast online adaptation and tackling RL-specific problems as some areas
for future work on methods for generalisation, and we recommend building
benchmarks in underexplored problem settings such as offline RL generalisation
and reward-function variation.</span>

minimization: to learn a parametric quantum circuit with at most $n^c$ gates
and each gate acting on a constant number of qubits, the sample complexity is
bounded by $\tilde{O}(n^{c+1})$. In particular, we explicitly construct a
family of variational quantum circuits with $O(n^{c+1})$ elementary gates
arranged in a fixed pattern, which can represent all physical quantum circuits
consisting of at most $n^c$ elementary gates. Our results provide a valuable
guide for quantum machine learning in both theory and practice.</span>

                    <span>Bayesian Optimization algorithm has become a promising approach for nonlinear
global optimization problems and many machine learning applications. Over the
past few years, improvements and enhancements have been brought forward and
they have shown some promising results in solving the complex dynamic problems,
systems of ordinary differential equations where the objective functions are
computationally expensive to evaluate. Besides, the straightforward
implementation of the Bayesian Optimization algorithm performs well merely for
optimization problems with 10-20 dimensions. The study presented in this paper
proposes a new high dimensional Bayesian Optimization algorithm combining
Recurrent neural networks, which is expected to predict the optimal solution
for the global optimization problems with high dimensional or time series
decision models. The proposed RNN-BO algorithm can solve the optimal control
problems in the lower dimension space and then learn from the historical data
using the recurrent neural network to learn the historical optimal solution
data and predict the optimal control strategy for any new initial system value
setting. In addition, accurately and quickly providing the optimal control
strategy is essential to effectively and efficiently control the epidemic
spread while minimizing the associated financial costs. Therefore, to verify
the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm, computational experiments are
carried out on a deterministic SEIR epidemic model and a stochastic SIS optimal
control model. Finally, we also discuss the impacts of different numbers of the
RNN layers and training epochs on the trade-off between solution quality and
related computational efforts.</span>

of wound boundaries in images is a key component of the care and diagnosis
protocol since it is important to estimate the area of the wound and provide
quantitative measurement for the treatment. Unfortunately, this process is very
time-consuming and requires a high level of expertise. Recently automatic wound
segmentation methods based on deep learning have shown promising performance
but require large datasets for training and it is unclear which methods perform
better. To address these issues, we propose the Foot Ulcer Segmentation
challenge (FUSeg) organized in conjunction with the 2021 International
Conference on Medical Image Computing and Computer Assisted Intervention
(MICCAI). We built a wound image dataset containing 1,210 foot ulcer images
collected over 2 years from 889 patients. It is pixel-wise annotated by wound
care experts and split into a training set with 1010 images and a testing set
with 200 images for evaluation. Teams around the world developed automated
methods to predict wound segmentations on the testing set of which annotations
were kept private. The predictions were evaluated and ranked based on the
average Dice coefficient. The FUSeg challenge remains an open challenge as a
benchmark for wound segmentation after the conference.</span>

                    <span>This paper proposes an information-theoretic loss for learning deep neural
networks. We propose a loss function based on the Information Bottleneck
principle and a max-margin loss with an aim to increase the class separability
in the embedded space. While deep neural network models have excelled in
supervised learning tasks with large-scale labeled data available, they are
prone to practical issues in testing samples outside of classes shown in
training, e.g., anomaly detection and out-of-distribution detection. In such
tasks, it is not sufficient to merely discriminate between known classes. Our
intuition is to represent the known classes in compact and separated embedded
regions in order to decrease the possibility of known and unseen classes
largely overlapping in the embedded space. We show that the IB-based loss
function reflects the inter-class distances as well as the compactness within
classes, thus will extend the extending models of the existing deep data
description models. Our empirical study shows that the proposed model improves
the segmentation of normal classes in the deep feature space which contributes
to identifying the out-of-distribution samples.</span>

                    <span>Although groups of strongly correlated antivirus engines are known to exist,
at present there is limited understanding of how or why these correlations came
to be. Using a corpus of 25 million VirusTotal reports representing over a
decade of antivirus scan data, we challenge prevailing wisdom that these
correlations primarily originate from &quot;first-order&quot; interactions such as
antivirus vendors copying the labels of leading vendors. We introduce the
Temporal Rank-1 Similarity Matrix decomposition (R1SM-T) in order to
investigate the origins of these correlations and to model how consensus
amongst antivirus engines changes over time. We reveal that first-order
interactions do not explain as much behavior in antivirus correlation as
previously thought, and that the relationships between antivirus engines are
highly volatile. We make recommendations on items in need of future study and
consideration based on our findings.</span>

                    <span>Objective: With the rapid rise of wearable sleep monitoring devices with
non-conventional electrode configurations, there is a need for automated
algorithms that can perform sleep staging on configurations with small amounts
of labeled data. Transfer learning has the ability to adapt neural network
weights from a source modality (e.g. standard electrode configuration) to a new
target modality (e.g. non-conventional electrode configuration). Methods: We
propose feature matching, a new transfer learning strategy as an alternative to
the commonly used finetuning approach. This method consists of training a model
with larger amounts of data from the source modality and few paired samples of
source and target modality. For those paired samples, the model extracts
features of the target modality, matching these to the features from the
corresponding samples of the source modality. Results: We compare feature
matching to finetuning for three different target domains, with two different
neural network architectures, and with varying amounts of training data.
Particularly on small cohorts (i.e. 2 - 5 labeled recordings in the
non-conventional recording setting), feature matching systematically
outperforms finetuning with mean relative differences in accuracy ranging from
0.4% to 4.7% for the different scenarios and datasets. Conclusion: Our findings
suggest that feature matching outperforms finetuning as a transfer learning
approach, especially in very low data regimes. Significance: As such, we
conclude that feature matching is a promising new method for wearable sleep
staging with novel devices.</span>

                    <span>Lung cancer has been one of the most prevalent disease in recent years.
According to the research of this field, more than 200,000 cases are identified
each year in the US. Uncontrolled multiplication and growth of the lung cells
result in malignant tumour formation. Recently, deep learning algorithms,
especially Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), have become a superior way to
automatically diagnose disease. The purpose of this article is to review
different models that lead to different accuracy and sensitivity in the
diagnosis of early-stage lung cancer and to help physicians and researchers in
this field. The main purpose of this work is to identify the challenges that
exist in lung cancer based on deep learning. The survey is systematically
written that combines regular mapping and literature review to review 32
conference and journal articles in the field from 2016 to 2021. After analysing
and reviewing the articles, the questions raised in the articles are being
answered. This research is superior to other review articles in this field due
to the complete review of relevant articles and systematic write up.</span>

different data distributions can exhibit distinct generalization behaviors. In
this paper, we analyze the generalization of models trained by noisy iterative
algorithms. We derive distribution-dependent generalization bounds by
connecting noisy iterative algorithms to additive noise channels found in
communication and information theory. Our generalization bounds shed light on
several applications, including differentially private stochastic gradient
descent (DP-SGD), federated learning, and stochastic gradient Langevin dynamics
(SGLD). We demonstrate our bounds through numerical experiments, showing that
they can help understand recent empirical observations of the generalization

                    <span>Meta-learning, or learning-to-learn, seeks to design algorithms that can
utilize previous experience to rapidly learn new skills or adapt to new
environments. Representation learning -- a key tool for performing
meta-learning -- learns a data representation that can transfer knowledge
across multiple tasks, which is essential in regimes where data is scarce.
Despite a recent surge of interest in the practice of meta-learning, the
theoretical underpinnings of meta-learning algorithms are lacking, especially
in the context of learning transferable representations. In this paper, we
focus on the problem of multi-task linear regression -- in which multiple
linear regression models share a common, low-dimensional linear representation.
Here, we provide provably fast, sample-efficient algorithms to address the dual
challenges of (1) learning a common set of features from multiple, related
tasks, and (2) transferring this knowledge to new, unseen tasks. Both are
central to the general problem of meta-learning. Finally, we complement these
results by providing information-theoretic lower bounds on the sample
complexity of learning these linear features.</span>

                    <span>The widely applied density peak clustering (DPC) algorithm makes an intuitive
cluster formation assumption that cluster centers are often surrounded by data
points with lower local density and far away from other data points with higher
local density. However, this assumption suffers from one limitation that it is
often problematic when identifying clusters with lower density because they
might be easily merged into other clusters with higher density. As a result,
DPC may not be able to identify clusters with variational density. To address
this issue, we propose a variational density peak clustering (VDPC) algorithm,
which is designed to systematically and autonomously perform the clustering
task on datasets with various types of density distributions. Specifically, we
first propose a novel method to identify the representatives among all data
points and construct initial clusters based on the identified representatives
for further analysis of the clusters&#x27; property. Furthermore, we divide all data
points into different levels according to their local density and propose a
unified clustering framework by combining the advantages of both DPC and
DBSCAN. Thus, all the identified initial clusters spreading across different
density levels are systematically processed to form the final clusters. To
evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed VDPC algorithm, we conduct extensive
experiments using 20 datasets including eight synthetic, six real-world and six
image datasets. The experimental results show that VDPC outperforms two
classical algorithms (i.e., DPC and DBSCAN) and four state-of-the-art extended
DPC algorithms.</span>

                    <span>It has become critical for deep learning algorithms to quantify their output
uncertainties to satisfy reliability constraints and provide accurate results.
Uncertainty estimation for regression has received less attention than
classification due to the more straightforward standardized output of the
latter class of tasks and their high importance. However, regression problems
are encountered in a wide range of applications in computer vision. We propose
SLURP, a generic approach for regression uncertainty estimation via a side
learner that exploits the output and the intermediate representations generated
by the main task model. We test SLURP on two critical regression tasks in
computer vision: monocular depth and optical flow estimation. In addition, we
conduct exhaustive benchmarks comprising transfer to different datasets and the
addition of aleatoric noise. The results show that our proposal is generic and
readily applicable to various regression problems and has a low computational
cost with respect to existing solutions.</span>

                    <span>In this paper, we revisit the constrained and stochastic continuous
submodular maximization in both offline and online settings. For each
$\gamma$-weakly DR-submodular function $f$, we use the factor-revealing
optimization equation to derive an optimal auxiliary function $F$, whose
stationary points provide a $(1-e^{-\gamma})$-approximation to the global
maximum value (denoted as $OPT$) of problem
$\max_{\boldsymbol{x}\in\mathcal{C}}f(\boldsymbol{x})$. Naturally, the
projected (mirror) gradient ascent relied on this non-oblivious function
achieves $(1-e^{-\gamma}-\epsilon^{2})OPT-\epsilon$ after $O(1/\epsilon^{2})$
iterations, beating the traditional
$(\frac{\gamma^{2}}{1+\gamma^{2}})$-approximation gradient ascent
\citep{hassani2017gradient} for submodular maximization. Similarly, based on
$F$, the classical Frank-Wolfe algorithm equipped with variance reduction
technique \citep{mokhtari2018conditional} also returns a solution with
objective value larger than $(1-e^{-\gamma}-\epsilon^{2})OPT-\epsilon$ after
$O(1/\epsilon^{3})$ iterations. In the online setting, we first consider the
adversarial delays for stochastic gradient feedback, under which we propose a
boosting online gradient algorithm with the same non-oblivious search,
achieving a regret of $\sqrt{D}$ (where $D$ is the sum of delays of gradient
feedback) against a $(1-e^{-\gamma})$-approximation to the best feasible
solution in hindsight. Finally, extensive numerical experiments demonstrate the
efficiency of our boosting methods.</span>

                    <span>This paper explores the feasibility of finding an optimal sub-model from a
vision transformer and introduces a pure vision transformer slimming (ViT-Slim)
framework that can search such a sub-structure from the original model
end-to-end across multiple dimensions, including the input tokens, MHSA and MLP
modules with state-of-the-art performance. Our method is based on a learnable
and unified l1 sparsity constraint with pre-defined factors to reflect the
global importance in the continuous searching space of different dimensions.
The searching process is highly efficient through a single-shot training
scheme. For instance, on DeiT-S, ViT-Slim only takes ~43 GPU hours for
searching process, and the searched structure is flexible with diverse
dimensionalities in different modules. Then, a budget threshold is employed
according to the requirements of accuracy-FLOPs trade-off on running devices,
and a re-training process is performed to obtain the final models. The
extensive experiments show that our ViT-Slim can compress up to 40% of
parameters and 40% FLOPs on various vision transformers while increasing the
accuracy by ~0.6% on ImageNet. We also demonstrate the advantage of our
searched models on several downstream datasets. Our source code will be

                    <span>As neural network classifiers are deployed in real-world applications, it is
crucial that their failures can be detected reliably. One practical solution is
to assign confidence scores to each prediction, then use these scores to filter
out possible misclassifications. However, existing confidence metrics are not
yet sufficiently reliable for this role. This paper presents a new framework
that produces a quantitative metric for detecting misclassification errors.
This framework, RED, builds an error detector on top of the base classifier and
estimates uncertainty of the detection scores using Gaussian Processes.
Experimental comparisons with other error detection methods on 125 UCI datasets
demonstrate that this approach is effective. Further implementations on two
probabilistic base classifiers and two large deep learning architecture in
vision tasks further confirm that the method is robust and scalable. Third, an
empirical analysis of RED with out-of-distribution and adversarial samples
shows that the method can be used not only to detect errors but also to
understand where they come from. RED can thereby be used to improve
trustworthiness of neural network classifiers more broadly in the future.</span>

Instead of learning the unclosed high order moment, we propose to directly
learn the gradient of the high order moment using neural networks. This new
approach is consistent with the exact closure we derive for the free streaming
limit and also provides a natural output normalization. A variety of benchmark
tests, including the variable scattering problem, the Gaussian source problem

if the quality w.r.t. its aspect Service is increased by 10%? The defining
challenge of causal inference with observational data is the presence of
&quot;confounder&quot;, which might not be observed or measured, e.g., consumers&#x27;
preference to food type, rendering the estimated effects biased and
high-variance. To address this challenge, we have recourse to the multi-modal
proxies such as the consumer profile information and interactions between
consumers and businesses. We show how to effectively leverage the rich
information to identify and estimate causal effects of multiple aspects
embedded in online reviews. Empirical evaluations on synthetic and real-world
data corroborate the efficacy and shed light on the actionable insight of the
proposed approach.</span>

                    <span>Deep neural networks have a wide range of applications in solving various
real-world tasks and have achieved satisfactory results, in domains such as
computer vision, image classification, and natural language processing.
Meanwhile, the security and robustness of neural networks have become
imperative, as diverse researches have shown the vulnerable aspects of neural
networks. Case in point, in Natural language processing tasks, the neural
network may be fooled by an attentively modified text, which has a high
similarity to the original one. As per previous research, most of the studies
are focused on the image domain; Different from image adversarial attacks, the
text is represented in a discrete sequence, traditional image attack methods
are not applicable in the NLP field. In this paper, we propose a word-level NLP
sentiment classifier attack model, which includes a self-attention
mechanism-based word selection method and a greedy search algorithm for word
substitution. We experiment with our attack model by attacking GRU and 1D-CNN
victim models on IMDB datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that our model
achieves a higher attack success rate and more efficient than previous methods
due to the efficient word selection algorithms are employed and minimized the
word substitute number. Also, our model is transferable, which can be used in
the image domain with several modifications.</span>

                    <span>Data poisoning for reinforcement learning has historically focused on general
performance degradation, and targeted attacks have been successful via
perturbations that involve control of the victim&#x27;s policy and rewards. We
introduce an insidious poisoning attack for reinforcement learning which causes
agent misbehavior only at specific target states - all while minimally
modifying a small fraction of training observations without assuming any
control over policy or reward. We accomplish this by adapting a recent
technique, gradient alignment, to reinforcement learning. We test our method
and demonstrate success in two Atari games of varying difficulty.</span>

                    <span>Devising dynamic pricing policy with always valid online statistical learning
procedure is an important and as yet unresolved problem. Most existing dynamic
pricing policy, which focus on the faithfulness of adopted customer choice
models, exhibit a limited capability for adapting the online uncertainty of
learned statistical model during pricing process. In this paper, we propose a
novel approach for designing dynamic pricing policy based regularized online
statistical learning with theoretical guarantees. The new approach overcomes
the challenge of continuous monitoring of online Lasso procedure and possesses
several appealing properties. In particular, we make the decisive observation
that the always-validity of pricing decisions builds and thrives on the online
regularization scheme. Our proposed online regularization scheme equips the
proposed optimistic online regularized maximum likelihood pricing (OORMLP)
pricing policy with three major advantages: encode market noise knowledge into
pricing process optimism; empower online statistical learning with
always-validity over all decision points; envelop prediction error process with
time-uniform non-asymptotic oracle inequalities. This type of non-asymptotic
inference results allows us to design more sample-efficient and robust dynamic
pricing algorithms in practice. In theory, the proposed OORMLP algorithm
exploits the sparsity structure of high-dimensional models and secures a
logarithmic regret in a decision horizon. These theoretical advances are made
possible by proposing an optimistic online Lasso procedure that resolves
dynamic pricing problems at the process level, based on a novel use of
non-asymptotic martingale concentration. In experiments, we evaluate OORMLP in
different synthetic and real pricing problem settings, and demonstrate that
OORMLP advances the state-of-the-art methods.</span>

                    <span>Time series analysis is a widespread task in Natural Sciences, Social
Sciences, and Engineering. A fundamental problem is finding an expressive yet
efficient-to-compute representation of the input time series to use as a
starting point to perform arbitrary downstream tasks. In this paper, we build
upon recent works that use the Signature of a path as a feature map and
investigate a computationally efficient technique to approximate these features
based on linear random projections. We present several theoretical results to
justify our approach and empirically validate that our random projections can
effectively retrieve the underlying Signature of a path. We show the surprising
performance of the proposed random features on several tasks, including (1)
mapping the controls of stochastic differential equations to the corresponding
solutions and (2) using the Randomized Signatures as time series representation
for classification tasks. When compared to corresponding truncated Signature
approaches, our Randomizes Signatures are more computationally efficient in
high dimensions and often lead to better accuracy and faster training. Besides
providing a new tool to extract Signatures and further validating the high
level of expressiveness of such features, we believe our results provide
interesting conceptual links between several existing research areas,
suggesting new intriguing directions for future investigations.</span>

                    <span>Recent years have witnessed the promise that reinforcement learning, coupled
with Graph Neural Network (GNN) architectures, could learn to solve hard
combinatorial optimization problems: given raw input data and an evaluator to
guide the process, the idea is to automatically learn a policy able to return
feasible and high-quality outputs. Recent work have shown promising results but
the latter were mainly evaluated on the travelling salesman problem (TSP) and
similar abstract variants such as Split Delivery Vehicle Routing Problem
(SDVRP). In this paper, we analyze how and whether recent neural architectures
can be applied to graph problems of practical importance. We thus set out to
systematically &quot;transfer&quot; these architectures to the Power and Channel
Allocation Problem (PCAP), which has practical relevance for, e.g., radio
resource allocation in wireless networks. Our experimental results suggest that
existing architectures (i) are still incapable of capturing graph structural
features and (ii) are not suitable for problems where the actions on the graph
change the graph attributes. On a positive note, we show that augmenting the
structural representation of problems with Distance Encoding is a promising
step towards the still-ambitious goal of learning multi-purpose autonomous
solvers.</span>

                    <span>Automated segmentation in medical image analysis is a challenging task that
requires a large amount of manually labeled data. However, manually annotating
medical data is often laborious, and most existing learning-based approaches
fail to accurately delineate object boundaries without effective geometric
constraints. Contrastive learning, a sub-area of self-supervised learning, has
recently been noted as a promising direction in multiple application fields. In
this work, we present a novel Contrastive Voxel-wise Representation
Distillation (CVRD) method with geometric constraints to learn global-local
visual representations for volumetric medical image segmentation with limited
annotations. Our framework can effectively learn global and local features by
capturing 3D spatial context and rich anatomical information. Specifically, we
introduce a voxel-to-volume contrastive algorithm to learn global information
from 3D images, and propose to perform local voxel-to-voxel distillation to
explicitly make use of local cues in the embedding space. Moreover, we
integrate an elastic interaction-based active contour model as a geometric
regularization term to enable fast and reliable object delineations in an
end-to-end learning manner. Results on the Atrial Segmentation Challenge
dataset demonstrate superiority of our proposed scheme, especially in a setting
with a very limited number of annotated data. The code will be available at

                    <span>Unsupervised learning has recently made exceptional progress because of the
development of more effective contrastive learning methods. However, CNNs are
prone to depend on low-level features that humans deem non-semantic. This
dependency has been conjectured to induce a lack of robustness to image
perturbations or domain shift. In this paper, we show that by generating
carefully designed negative samples, contrastive learning can learn more robust
representations with less dependence on such features. Contrastive learning
utilizes positive pairs that preserve semantic information while perturbing
superficial features in the training images. Similarly, we propose to generate
negative samples in a reversed way, where only the superfluous instead of the
semantic features are preserved. We develop two methods, texture-based and
patch-based augmentations, to generate negative samples. These samples achieve
better generalization, especially under out-of-domain settings. We also analyze
our method and the generated texture-based samples, showing that texture
features are indispensable in classifying particular ImageNet classes and
especially finer classes. We also show that model bias favors texture and shape
features differently under different test settings. Our code, trained models,
and ImageNet-Texture dataset can be found at

                    <span>Recent research has shown that graph neural networks (GNNs) can learn
policies for locomotion control that are as effective as a typical multi-layer
perceptron (MLP), with superior transfer and multi-task performance (Wang et
al., 2018; Huang et al., 2020). Results have so far been limited to training on
small agents, with the performance of GNNs deteriorating rapidly as the number
of sensors and actuators grows. A key motivation for the use of GNNs in the
supervised learning setting is their applicability to large graphs, but this
benefit has not yet been realised for locomotion control. We identify the
weakness with a common GNN architecture that causes this poor scaling:
overfitting in the MLPs within the network that encode, decode, and propagate
messages. To combat this, we introduce Snowflake, a GNN training method for
high-dimensional continuous control that freezes parameters in parts of the
network that suffer from overfitting. Snowflake significantly boosts the
performance of GNNs for locomotion control on large agents, now matching the
performance of MLPs, and with superior transfer properties.</span>

                    <span>Many complex multi-agent systems such as robot swarms control and autonomous
vehicle coordination can be modeled as Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning
(MARL) tasks. QMIX, a widely popular MARL algorithm, has been used as a
baseline for the benchmark environments, e.g., Starcraft Multi-Agent Challenge
(SMAC), Difficulty-Enhanced Predator-Prey (DEPP). Recent variants of QMIX
target relaxing the monotonicity constraint of QMIX, allowing for performance
improvement in SMAC. In this paper, we investigate the code-level optimizations
of these variants and the monotonicity constraint. (1) We find that such
improvements of the variants are significantly affected by various code-level
optimizations. (2) The experiment results show that QMIX with normalized
optimizations outperforms other works in SMAC; (3) beyond the common wisdom
from these works, the monotonicity constraint can improve sample efficiency in
SMAC and DEPP. We also discuss why monotonicity constraints work well in purely
cooperative tasks with a theoretical analysis. We open-source the code at

                    <span>Bike Sharing Systems (BSSs) are emerging as an innovative transportation
service. Ensuring the proper functioning of a BSS is crucial given that these
systems are committed to eradicating many of the current global concerns, by
promoting environmental and economic sustainability and contributing to
improving the life quality of the population. Good knowledge of users&#x27;
transition patterns is a decisive contribution to the quality and operability
of the service. The analogous and unbalanced users&#x27; transition patterns cause
these systems to suffer from bicycle imbalance, leading to a drastic customer
loss in the long term. Strategies for bicycle rebalancing become important to
tackle this problem and for this, bicycle traffic prediction is essential, as
it allows to operate more efficiently and to react in advance. In this work, we
propose a bicycle trips predictor based on Graph Neural Network embeddings,
taking into consideration station groupings, meteorology conditions,
geographical distances, and trip patterns. We evaluated our approach in the New
York City BSS (CitiBike) data and compared it with four baselines, including
the non-clustered approach. To address our problem&#x27;s specificities, we
developed the Adaptive Transition Constraint Clustering Plus (AdaTC+)
algorithm, eliminating shortcomings of previous work. Our experiments evidence
the clustering pertinence (88% accuracy compared with 83% without clustering)
and which clustering technique best suits this problem. Accuracy on the Link
Prediction task is always higher for AdaTC+ than benchmark clustering methods
when the stations are the same, while not degrading performance when the
network is upgraded, in a mismatch with the trained model.</span>

                    <span>Automating machine learning has achieved remarkable technological
developments in recent years, and building an automated machine learning
pipeline is now an essential task. The model ensemble is the technique of
combining multiple models to get a better and more robust model. However,
existing automated machine learning tends to be simplistic in handling the
model ensemble, where the ensemble strategy is fixed, such as stacked
generalization. There have been many techniques on different ensemble methods,
especially ensemble selection, and the fixed ensemble strategy limits the upper
limit of the model&#x27;s performance. In this article, we present a novel framework
for automated machine learning. Our framework incorporates advances in dynamic
ensemble selection, and to our best knowledge, our approach is the first in the
field of AutoML to search and optimize ensemble strategies. In the comparison
experiments, our method outperforms the state-of-the-art automated machine
learning frameworks with the same CPU time in 42 classification datasets from
the OpenML platform. Ablation experiments on our framework validate the
effectiveness of our proposed method.</span>

                    <span>Recent studies have highlighted adversarial examples as ubiquitous threats to
the deep neural network (DNN) based speech recognition systems. In this work,
we present a U-Net based attention model, U-Net$_{At}$, to enhance adversarial
speech signals. Specifically, we evaluate the model performance by
interpretable speech recognition metrics and discuss the model performance by
the augmented adversarial training. Our experiments show that our proposed
U-Net$_{At}$ improves the perceptual evaluation of speech quality (PESQ) from
1.13 to 2.78, speech transmission index (STI) from 0.65 to 0.75, short-term
objective intelligibility (STOI) from 0.83 to 0.96 on the task of speech
enhancement with adversarial speech examples. We conduct experiments on the
automatic speech recognition (ASR) task with adversarial audio attacks. We find
that (i) temporal features learned by the attention network are capable of
enhancing the robustness of DNN based ASR models; (ii) the generalization power
of DNN based ASR model could be enhanced by applying adversarial training with
an additive adversarial data augmentation. The ASR metric on word-error-rates
(WERs) shows that there is an absolute 2.22 $\%$ decrease under gradient-based
perturbation, and an absolute 2.03 $\%$ decrease, under evolutionary-optimized
perturbation, which suggests that our enhancement models with adversarial
training can further secure a resilient ASR system.</span>

                    <span>In the autonomous driving field, the fusion of human knowledge into Deep
Reinforcement Learning (DRL) is often based on the human demonstration recorded
in the simulated environment. This limits the generalization and the
feasibility of application in real-world traffic. We proposed a two-stage DRL
method, that learns from real-world human driving to achieve performance that
is superior to the pure DRL agent. Training a DRL agent is done within a
framework for CARLA with Robot Operating System (ROS). For evaluation, we
designed different real-world driving scenarios to compare the proposed
two-stage DRL agent with the pure DRL agent. After extracting the &#x27;good&#x27;
behavior from the human driver, such as anticipation in a signalized
intersection, the agent becomes more efficient and drives safer, which makes
this autonomous agent more adapt to Human-Robot Interaction (HRI) traffic.</span>

                    <span>Neural networks with the Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) nonlinearity are
described by a vector of parameters $\theta$, and realized as a piecewise
linear continuous function $R_{\theta}: x \in \mathbb R^{d} \mapsto
R_{\theta}(x) \in \mathbb R^{k}$. Natural scalings and permutations operations
on the parameters $\theta$ leave the realization unchanged, leading to
equivalence classes of parameters that yield the same realization. These
considerations in turn lead to the notion of identifiability -- the ability to
recover (the equivalence class of) $\theta$ from the sole knowledge of its
realization $R_{\theta}$. The overall objective of this paper is to introduce
an embedding for ReLU neural networks of any depth, $\Phi(\theta)$, that is
invariant to scalings and that provides a locally linear parameterization of
the realization of the network. Leveraging these two key properties, we derive
some conditions under which a deep ReLU network is indeed locally identifiable
from the knowledge of the realization on a finite set of samples $x_{i} \in
\mathbb R^{d}$. We study the shallow case in more depth, establishing necessary
and sufficient conditions for the network to be identifiable from a bounded
subset $\mathcal X \subseteq \mathbb R^{d}$.</span>

                    <span>Among the most successful methods for sparsifying deep (neural) networks are
those that adaptively mask the network weights throughout training. By
examining this masking, or dropout, in the linear case, we uncover a duality
between such adaptive methods and regularization through the so-called
&quot;$\eta$-trick&quot; that casts both as iteratively reweighted optimizations. We show
that any dropout strategy that adapts to the weights in a monotonic way
corresponds to an effective subquadratic regularization penalty, and therefore
leads to sparse solutions. We obtain the effective penalties for several
popular sparsification strategies, which are remarkably similar to classical
penalties commonly used in sparse optimization. Considering variational dropout
as a case study, we demonstrate similar empirical behavior between the adaptive
dropout method and classical methods on the task of deep network
sparsification, validating our theory.</span>

                    <span>Human Activity Recognition (HAR) is one of the key applications of health
monitoring that requires continuous use of wearable devices to track daily
activities. This paper proposes an Adaptive CNN for energy-efficient HAR (AHAR)
suitable for low-power edge devices. Unlike traditional early exit architecture
that makes the exit decision based on classification confidence, AHAR proposes
a novel adaptive architecture that uses an output block predictor to select a
portion of the baseline architecture to use during the inference phase.
Experimental results show that traditional early exit architectures suffer from
performance loss whereas our adaptive architecture provides similar or better
performance as the baseline one while being energy-efficient. We validate our
methodology in classifying locomotion activities from two datasets- Opportunity
and w-HAR. Compared to the fog/cloud computing approaches for the Opportunity
dataset, our baseline and adaptive architecture shows a comparable weighted F1
score of 91.79%, and 91.57%, respectively. For the w-HAR dataset, our baseline
and adaptive architecture outperforms the state-of-the-art works with a
weighted F1 score of 97.55%, and 97.64%, respectively. Evaluation on real
hardware shows that our baseline architecture is significantly energy-efficient
(422.38x less) and memory-efficient (14.29x less) compared to the works on the
Opportunity dataset. For the w-HAR dataset, our baseline architecture requires
2.04x less energy and 2.18x less memory compared to the state-of-the-art work.
Moreover, experimental results show that our adaptive architecture is 12.32%
(Opportunity) and 11.14% (w-HAR) energy-efficient than our baseline while
providing similar (Opportunity) or better (w-HAR) performance with no
significant memory overhead.</span>

                    <span>Federated Learning (FL) allows multiple clients to collaboratively train a
Neural Network (NN) model on their private data without revealing the data.
Recently, several targeted poisoning attacks against FL have been introduced.
These attacks inject a backdoor into the resulting model that allows
adversary-controlled inputs to be misclassified. Existing countermeasures
against backdoor attacks are inefficient and often merely aim to exclude
deviating models from the aggregation. However, this approach also removes
benign models of clients with deviating data distributions, causing the
aggregated model to perform poorly for such clients.

To address this problem, we propose DeepSight, a novel model filtering
approach for mitigating backdoor attacks. It is based on three novel techniques
that allow to characterize the distribution of data used to train model updates
and seek to measure fine-grained differences in the internal structure and
outputs of NNs. Using these techniques, DeepSight can identify suspicious model
updates. We also develop a scheme that can accurately cluster model updates.
Combining the results of both components, DeepSight is able to identify and
eliminate model clusters containing poisoned models with high attack impact. We
also show that the backdoor contributions of possibly undetected poisoned
models can be effectively mitigated with existing weight clipping-based
defenses. We evaluate the performance and effectiveness of DeepSight and show
that it can mitigate state-of-the-art backdoor attacks with a negligible impact
on the model&#x27;s performance on benign data.</span>

                    <span>The staple of human intelligence is the capability of acquiring knowledge in
a continuous fashion. In stark contrast, Deep Networks forget catastrophically
and, for this reason, the sub-field of Class-Incremental Continual Learning
fosters methods that learn a sequence of tasks incrementally, blending
sequentially-gained knowledge into a comprehensive prediction.

This work aims at assessing and overcoming the pitfalls of our previous
proposal Dark Experience Replay (DER), a simple and effective approach that
combines rehearsal and Knowledge Distillation. Inspired by the way our minds
constantly rewrite past recollections and set expectations for the future, we
endow our model with the abilities to i) revise its replay memory to welcome
novel information regarding past data ii) pave the way for learning yet unseen
classes.

We show that the application of these strategies leads to remarkable
improvements; indeed, the resulting method - termed eXtended-DER (X-DER) -
outperforms the state of the art on both standard benchmarks (such as CIFAR-100
and miniImagenet) and a novel one here introduced. To gain a better
understanding, we further provide extensive ablation studies that corroborate
and extend the findings of our previous research (e.g. the value of Knowledge
Distillation and flatter minima in continual learning setups).</span>

                    <span>Large sparse linear systems of equations are ubiquitous in science and
engineering, such as those arising from discretizations of partial differential
equations. Algebraic multigrid (AMG) methods are one of the most common methods
of solving such linear systems, with an extensive body of underlying
mathematical theory. A system of linear equations defines a graph on the set of
unknowns and each level of a multigrid solver requires the selection of an
appropriate coarse graph along with restriction and interpolation operators
that map to and from the coarse representation. The efficiency of the multigrid
solver depends critically on this selection and many selection methods have
been developed over the years. Recently, it has been demonstrated that it is
possible to directly learn the AMG interpolation and restriction operators,
given a coarse graph selection. In this paper, we consider the complementary
problem of learning to coarsen graphs for a multigrid solver, a necessary step
in developing fully learnable AMG methods. We propose a method using a
reinforcement learning (RL) agent based on graph neural networks (GNNs), which
can learn to perform graph coarsening on small planar training graphs and then
be applied to unstructured large planar graphs, assuming bounded node degree.
We demonstrate that this method can produce better coarse graphs than existing
algorithms, even as the graph size increases and other properties of the graph
are varied. We also propose an efficient inference procedure for performing
graph coarsening that results in linear time complexity in graph size.</span>

autonomous driving, and smart everything which brings together massive and
diverse IoT devices occupying the radio frequency (RF) spectrum. Along with
spectrum crunch and throughput challenges, such a massive scale of wireless
devices exposes unprecedented threat surfaces. RF fingerprinting is heralded as
a candidate technology that can be combined with cryptographic and zero-trust
security measures to ensure data privacy, confidentiality, and integrity in
wireless networks. Motivated by the relevance of this subject in the future
communication networks, in this work, we present a comprehensive survey of RF

constrained presentation of the wireless fingerprinting approaches, however,
many aspects remain untold. In this work, however, we mitigate this by
addressing every aspect - background on signal intelligence (SIGINT),
applications, relevant DL algorithms, systematic literature review of RF
fingerprinting techniques spanning the past two decades, discussion on
datasets, and potential research avenues - necessary to elucidate this topic to

                    <span>Social networks play a fundamental role in propagation of information and
news. Characterizing the content of the messages becomes vital for different
tasks, like breaking news detection, personalized message recommendation, fake
users detection, information flow characterization and others. However, Twitter
posts are short and often less coherent than other text documents, which makes
it challenging to apply text mining algorithms to these datasets efficiently.
Tweet-pooling (aggregating tweets into longer documents) has been shown to
improve automatic topic decomposition, but the performance achieved in this
task varies depending on the pooling method.

In this paper, we propose a new pooling scheme for topic modeling in Twitter,
which groups tweets whose authors belong to the same community (group of users
who mainly interact with each other but not with other groups) on a user
interaction graph. We present a complete evaluation of this methodology, state
of the art schemes and previous pooling models in terms of the cluster quality,
document retrieval tasks performance and supervised machine learning
classification score. Results show that our Community polling method
outperformed other methods on the majority of metrics in two heterogeneous
datasets, while also reducing the running time. This is useful when dealing
with big amounts of noisy and short user-generated social media texts. Overall,
our findings contribute to an improved methodology for identifying the latent
topics in a Twitter dataset, without the need of modifying the basic machinery
of a topic decomposition model.</span>

                    <span>Humans and other animals learn to extract general concepts from sensory
experience without extensive teaching. This ability is thought to be
facilitated by offline states like sleep where previous experiences are
systemically replayed. However, the characteristic creative nature of dreams
suggests that learning semantic representations may go beyond merely replaying
previous experiences. We support this hypothesis by implementing a cortical
architecture inspired by generative adversarial networks (GANs). Learning in
our model is organized across three different global brain states mimicking
wakefulness, NREM and REM sleep, optimizing different, but complementary
objective functions. We train the model on standard datasets of natural images
and evaluate the quality of the learned representations. Our results suggest
that generating new, virtual sensory inputs via adversarial dreaming during REM
sleep is essential for extracting semantic concepts, while replaying episodic
memories via perturbed dreaming during NREM sleep improves the robustness of
latent representations. The model provides a new computational perspective on
sleep states, memory replay and dreams and suggests a cortical implementation
of GANs.</span>

                    <span>Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have recently attracted considerable
attention in the AI community due to its ability to generate high-quality data
of significant statistical resemblance to real data. Fundamentally, GAN is a
game between two neural networks trained in an adversarial manner to reach a
zero-sum Nash equilibrium profile. Despite the improvement accomplished in GANs
in the last few years, several issues remain to be solved. This paper reviews
the literature on the game theoretic aspects of GANs and addresses how game
theory models can address specific challenges of generative model and improve
the GAN&#x27;s performance. We first present some preliminaries, including the basic
GAN model and some game theory background. We then present taxonomy to classify
state-of-the-art solutions into three main categories: modified game models,
modified architectures, and modified learning methods. The classification is
based on modifications made to the basic GAN model by proposed game-theoretic
approaches in the literature. We then explore the objectives of each category
and discuss recent works in each category. Finally, we discuss the remaining
challenges in this field and present future research directions.</span>

                    <span>At the end of 2019, the latest novel coronavirus Sars-CoV-2 emerged as a
significant acute respiratory disease that has become a global pandemic.
Countries like Brazil have had difficulty in dealing with the virus due to the
high socioeconomic difference of states and municipalities. Therefore, this
study presents a new approach using different machine learning and deep
learning algorithms applied to Brazilian COVID-19 data. First, a clustering
algorithm is used to identify counties with similar sociodemographic behavior,
while Benford&#x27;s law is used to check for data manipulation. Based on these
results we are able to correctly model SARIMA models based on the clusters to
predict new daily cases. The unsupervised machine learning techniques optimized
the process of defining the parameters of the SARIMA model. This framework can
also be useful to propose confinement scenarios during the so-called second
wave. We have used the 645 counties from S\~ao Paulo state, the most populous
state in Brazil. However, this methodology can be used in other states or
countries. This paper demonstrates how different techniques of machine
learning, deep learning, data mining and statistics can be used together to
produce important results when dealing with pandemic data. Although the
findings cannot be used exclusively to assess and influence policy decisions,
they offer an alternative to the ineffective measures that have been used.</span>

                    <span>The actor-critic RL is widely used in various robotic control tasks. By
viewing the actor-critic RL from the perspective of variational inference (VI),
the policy network is trained to obtain the approximate posterior of actions
given the optimality criteria. However, in practice, the actor-critic RL may
yield suboptimal policy estimates due to the amortization gap and insufficient
exploration. In this work, inspired by the previous use of Hamiltonian Monte
Carlo (HMC) in VI, we propose to integrate the policy network of actor-critic
RL with HMC, which is termed as {\it Hamiltonian Policy}. As such we propose to
evolve actions from the base policy according to HMC, and our proposed method
has many benefits. First, HMC can improve the policy distribution to better
approximate the posterior and hence reduce the amortization gap. Second, HMC
can also guide the exploration more to the regions of action spaces with higher
Q values, enhancing the exploration efficiency. Further, instead of directly
applying HMC into RL, we propose a new leapfrog operator to simulate the
Hamiltonian dynamics. Finally, in safe RL problems, we find that the proposed
method can not only improve the achieved return, but also reduce safety
constraint violations by discarding potentially unsafe actions. With
comprehensive empirical experiments on continuous control baselines, including
MuJoCo and PyBullet Roboschool, we show that the proposed approach is a
data-efficient and easy-to-implement improvement over previous actor-critic
methods.</span>

                    <span>This paper present a strong data mining method based on rough set, which can
realize feature selection, classification and knowledge representation at the
same time. Rough set has good interpretability, and is a popular method for
feature selections. But low efficiency and low accuracy are its main drawbacks
that limits its application ability. In this paper,corresponding to the
accuracy, we first find the ineffectiveness of rough set because of
overfitting, especially in processing noise attribute, and propose a robust
measurement for an attribute, called relative importance.we proposed the
concept of &quot;rough concept tree&quot; for knowledge representation and
classification. Experimental results on public benchmark data sets show that
the proposed framework achieves higher accurcy than seven popular or the
state-of-the-art feature selection methods.</span>

                    <span>Running machine learning algorithms on large and rapidly growing volumes of
data is often computationally expensive, one common trick to reduce the size of
a data set, and thus reduce the computational cost of machine learning
algorithms, is \emph{probability sampling}. It creates a sampled data set by
including each data point from the original data set with a known probability.
Although the benefit of running machine learning algorithms on the reduced data
set is obvious, one major concern is that the performance of the solution
obtained from samples might be much worse than that of the optimal solution
when using the full data set. In this paper, we examine the performance loss
caused by probability sampling in the context of adaptive submodular
maximization. We consider a simple probability sampling method which selects
each data point with probability $r\in[0,1]$. If we set the sampling rate
$r&#x3D;1$, our problem reduces to finding a solution based on the original full
data set. We define sampling gap as the largest ratio between the optimal
solution obtained from the full data set and the optimal solution obtained from
the samples, over independence systems. %It captures the performance loss of
the optimal solution caused by the probability sampling. Our main contribution
is to show that if the utility function is policywise submodular, then for a
given sampling rate $r$, the sampling gap is both upper bounded and lower
bounded by $1/r$. One immediate implication of our result is that if we can
find an $\alpha$-approximation solution based on a sampled data set (which is
sampled at sampling rate $r$), then this solution achieves an $\alpha r$
approximation ratio against the optimal solution when using the full data set.</span>

                    <span>Classification of malware families is crucial for a comprehensive
understanding of how they can infect devices, computers, or systems. Thus,
malware identification enables security researchers and incident responders to
take precautions against malware and accelerate mitigation. API call sequences
made by malware are widely utilized features by machine and deep learning
models for malware classification as these sequences represent the behavior of
malware. However, traditional machine and deep learning models remain incapable
of capturing sequence relationships between API calls. On the other hand, the
transformer-based models process sequences as a whole and learn relationships
between API calls due to multi-head attention mechanisms and positional
embeddings. Our experiments demonstrate that the transformer model with one
transformer block layer surpassed the widely used base architecture, LSTM.
Moreover, BERT or CANINE, pre-trained transformer models, outperformed in
classifying highly imbalanced malware families according to evaluation metrics,
F1-score, and AUC score. Furthermore, the proposed bagging-based random
transformer forest (RTF), an ensemble of BERT or CANINE, has reached the
state-of-the-art evaluation scores on three out of four datasets, particularly
state-of-the-art F1-score of 0.6149 on one of the commonly used benchmark

                    <span>FPGA-specific DNN architectures using the native LUTs as independently
trainable inference operators have been shown to achieve favorable
area-accuracy and energy-accuracy tradeoffs. The first work in this area,
LUTNet, exhibited state-of-the-art performance for standard DNN benchmarks. In
this paper, we propose the learned optimization of such LUT-based topologies,
resulting in higher-efficiency designs than via the direct use of
off-the-shelf, hand-designed networks. Existing implementations of this class
of architecture require the manual specification of the number of inputs per
LUT, K. Choosing appropriate K a priori is challenging, and doing so at even
high granularity, e.g. per layer, is a time-consuming and error-prone process
that leaves FPGAs&#x27; spatial flexibility underexploited. Furthermore, prior works
see LUT inputs connected randomly, which does not guarantee a good choice of
network topology. To address these issues, we propose logic shrinkage, a
fine-grained netlist pruning methodology enabling K to be automatically learned
for every LUT in a neural network targeted for FPGA inference. By removing LUT
inputs determined to be of low importance, our method increases the efficiency
of the resultant accelerators. Our GPU-friendly solution to LUT input removal
is capable of processing large topologies during their training with negligible
slowdown. With logic shrinkage, we better the area and energy efficiency of the
best-performing LUTNet implementation of the CNV network classifying CIFAR-10
by 1.54x and 1.31x, respectively, while matching its accuracy. This
implementation also reaches 2.71x the area efficiency of an equally accurate,
heavily pruned BNN. On ImageNet with the Bi-Real Net architecture, employment
of logic shrinkage results in a post-synthesis area reduction of 2.67x vs
LUTNet, allowing for implementation that was previously impossible on today&#x27;s
largest FPGAs.</span>

                    <span>In practical data analysis under noisy environment, it is common to first use
robust methods to identify outliers, and then to conduct further analysis after
removing the outliers. In this paper, we consider statistical inference of the
model estimated after outliers are removed, which can be interpreted as a
selective inference (SI) problem. To use conditional SI framework, it is
necessary to characterize the events of how the robust method identifies
outliers. Unfortunately, the existing methods cannot be directly used here
because they are applicable to the case where the selection events can be
represented by linear/quadratic constraints. In this paper, we propose a
conditional SI method for popular robust regressions by using homotopy method.
We show that the proposed conditional SI method is applicable to a wide class
of robust regression and outlier detection methods and has good empirical
performance on both synthetic data and real data experiments.</span>

                    <span>Interest in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and its applications has seen
unprecedented growth in the last few years. This success can be partly
attributed to the advancements made in the sub-fields of AI such as machine
learning, computer vision, and natural language processing. Much of the growth
in these fields has been made possible with deep learning, a sub-area of
machine learning that uses artificial neural networks. This has created
significant interest in the integration of vision and language. In this survey,
we focus on ten prominent tasks that integrate language and vision by
discussing their problem formulation, methods, existing datasets, evaluation
measures, and compare the results obtained with corresponding state-of-the-art
methods. Our efforts go beyond earlier surveys which are either task-specific
or concentrate only on one type of visual content, i.e., image or video.
Furthermore, we also provide some potential future directions in this field of
research with an anticipation that this survey stimulates innovative thoughts
and ideas to address the existing challenges and build new applications.</span>

                    <span>Dimensionality reduction methods have found vast application as visualization
tools in diverse areas of science. Although many different methods exist, their
performance is often insufficient for providing quick insight into many
contemporary datasets, and the unsupervised mode of use prevents the users from
utilizing the methods for dataset exploration and fine-tuning the details for
improved visualization quality. We present BlosSOM, a high-performance
semi-supervised dimensionality reduction software for interactive
user-steerable visualization of high-dimensional datasets with millions of
individual data points. BlosSOM builds on a GPU-accelerated implementation of
the EmbedSOM algorithm, complemented by several landmark-based algorithms for
interfacing the unsupervised model learning algorithms with the user
supervision. We show the application of BlosSOM on realistic datasets, where it
helps to produce high-quality visualizations that incorporate user-specified
layout and focus on certain features. We believe the semi-supervised
dimensionality reduction will improve the data visualization possibilities for
science areas such as single-cell cytometry, and provide a fast and efficient
base methodology for new directions in dataset exploration and annotation.</span>

                    <span>Hybrid analog and digital beamforming transceivers are instrumental in
addressing the challenge of expensive hardware and high training overheads in
the next generation millimeter-wave (mm-Wave) massive MIMO (multiple-input
multiple-output) systems. However, lack of fully digital beamforming in hybrid
architectures and short coherence times at mm-Wave impose additional
constraints on the channel estimation. Prior works on addressing these
challenges have focused largely on narrowband channels wherein
optimization-based or greedy algorithms were employed to derive hybrid
beamformers. In this paper, we introduce a deep learning (DL) approach for
channel estimation and hybrid beamforming for frequency-selective, wideband
mm-Wave systems. In particular, we consider a massive MIMO Orthogonal Frequency
Division Multiplexing (MIMO-OFDM) system and propose three different DL
frameworks comprising convolutional neural networks (CNNs), which accept the
raw data of received signal as input and yield channel estimates and the hybrid
beamformers at the output. We also introduce both offline and online prediction
schemes. Numerical experiments demonstrate that, compared to the current
state-of-the-art optimization and DL methods, our approach provides higher
spectral efficiency, lesser computational cost and fewer number of pilot
signals, and higher tolerance against the deviations in the received pilot
data, corrupted channel matrix, and propagation environment.</span>

                    <span>We study the random reshuffling (RR) method for smooth nonconvex optimization
problems with a finite-sum structure. Though this method is widely utilized in
practice such as the training of neural networks, its convergence behavior is
only understood in several limited settings. In this paper, under the
well-known Kurdyka-Lojasiewicz (KL) inequality, we establish strong limit-point
convergence results for RR with appropriate diminishing step sizes, namely, the
whole sequence of iterates generated by RR is convergent and converges to a
single stationary point in an almost sure sense. In addition, we derive the
corresponding rate of convergence, depending on the KL exponent and the
suitably selected diminishing step sizes. When the KL exponent lies in
$[0,\frac12]$, the convergence is at a rate of $\mathcal{O}(t^{-1})$ with $t$
counting the iteration number. When the KL exponent belongs to $(\frac12,1)$,
our derived convergence rate is of the form $\mathcal{O}(t^{-q})$ with $q\in
(0,1)$ depending on the KL exponent. The standard KL inequality-based
convergence analysis framework only applies to algorithms with a certain
descent property. We conduct a novel convergence analysis for the non-descent
RR method with diminishing step sizes based on the KL inequality, which
generalizes the standard KL framework. We summarize our main steps and core
ideas in an informal analysis framework, which is of independent interest. As a
direct application of this framework, we also establish similar strong
limit-point convergence results for the reshuffled proximal point method.</span>

                    <span>Self-supervised representation learning has made significant leaps fueled by
progress in contrastive learning, which seeks to learn transformations that
embed positive input pairs nearby, while pushing negative pairs far apart.
While positive pairs can be generated reliably (e.g., as different views of the
same image), it is difficult to accurately establish negative pairs, defined as
samples from different images regardless of their semantic content or visual
features. A fundamental problem in contrastive learning is mitigating the
effects of false negatives. Contrasting false negatives induces two critical
issues in representation learning: discarding semantic information and slow
convergence. In this paper, we propose novel approaches to identify false
negatives, as well as two strategies to mitigate their effect, i.e. false
negative elimination and attraction, while systematically performing rigorous
evaluations to study this problem in detail. Our method exhibits consistent
improvements over existing contrastive learning-based methods. Without labels,
we identify false negatives with 40% accuracy among 1000 semantic classes on
ImageNet, and achieve 5.8% absolute improvement in top-1 accuracy over the
previous state-of-the-art when finetuning with 1% labels. Our code is available

                    <span>Recently, Zhang et al.(2021) developed a new neural network architecture
based on $\ell_\infty$-distance functions, which naturally possesses certified
$\ell_\infty$ robustness by its construction. Despite rigorous theoretical
guarantees, the model so far can only achieve comparable performance to
conventional networks. In this paper, we make the following two contributions:
$\mathrm{(i)}$ We demonstrate that $\ell_\infty$-distance nets enjoy a
fundamental advantage in certified robustness over conventional networks (under
typical certification approaches); $\mathrm{(ii)}$ With an improved training
process we are able to significantly boost the certified accuracy of
$\ell_\infty$-distance nets. Our training approach largely alleviates the
optimization problem that arose in the previous training scheme, in particular,
the unexpected large Lipschitz constant due to the use of a crucial trick
called $\ell_p$-relaxation. The core of our training approach is a novel
objective function that combines scaled cross-entropy loss and clipped hinge
loss with a decaying mixing coefficient. Experiments show that using the
proposed training strategy, the certified accuracy of $\ell_\infty$-distance
net can be dramatically improved from 33.30% to 40.06% on CIFAR-10
($\epsilon&#x3D;8/255$), meanwhile outperforming other approaches in this area by a
large margin. Our results clearly demonstrate the effectiveness and potential
of $\ell_\infty$-distance net for certified robustness. Codes are available at

                    <span>Federated learning (FL) has emerged as a popular methodology for distributing
machine learning across wireless edge devices. In this work, we consider
optimizing the tradeoff between model performance and resource utilization in
FL, under device-server communication delays and device computation
heterogeneity. Our proposed StoFedDelAv algorithm incorporates a local-global
model combiner into the FL synchronization step. We theoretically characterize
the convergence behavior of StoFedDelAv and obtain the optimal combiner
weights, which consider the global model delay and expected local gradient
error at each device. We then formulate a network-aware optimization problem
which tunes the minibatch sizes of the devices to jointly minimize energy
consumption and machine learning training loss, and solve the non-convex
problem through a series of convex approximations. Our simulations reveal that
StoFedDelAv outperforms the current art in FL in terms of model convergence
speed and network resource utilization when the minibatch size and the combiner
weights are adjusted. Additionally, our method can reduce the number of uplink
communication rounds required during the model training period to reach the
same accuracy.</span>

                    <span>Data augmentation is a simple yet effective way to improve the robustness of
deep neural networks (DNNs). Diversity and hardness are two complementary
dimensions of data augmentation to achieve robustness. For example, AugMix
explores random compositions of a diverse set of augmentations to enhance
broader coverage, while adversarial training generates adversarially hard
samples to spot the weakness. Motivated by this, we propose a data augmentation
framework, termed AugMax, to unify the two aspects of diversity and hardness.
AugMax first randomly samples multiple augmentation operators and then learns
an adversarial mixture of the selected operators. Being a stronger form of data
augmentation, AugMax leads to a significantly augmented input distribution
which makes model training more challenging. To solve this problem, we further
design a disentangled normalization module, termed DuBIN
(Dual-Batch-and-Instance Normalization), that disentangles the instance-wise
feature heterogeneity arising from AugMax. Experiments show that AugMax-DuBIN
leads to significantly improved out-of-distribution robustness, outperforming
prior arts by 3.03%, 3.49%, 1.82% and 0.71% on CIFAR10-C, CIFAR100-C, Tiny
ImageNet-C and ImageNet-C. Codes and pretrained models are available:

                    <span>Counterfactual Regret Minimization (CFR) has achieved many fascinating
results in solving large-scale Imperfect Information Games (IIGs). Neural
network approximation CFR (neural CFR) is one of the promising techniques that
can reduce computation and memory consumption by generalizing decision
information between similar states. Current neural CFR algorithms have to
approximate cumulative regrets. However, efficient and accurate approximation
in a large-scale IIG is still a tough challenge. In this paper, a new CFR
variant, Recursive CFR (ReCFR), is proposed. In ReCFR, Recursive Substitute
Values (RSVs) are learned and used to replace cumulative regrets. It is proven
that ReCFR can converge to a Nash equilibrium at a rate of
$O(\frac{1}{\sqrt{T}})$. Based on ReCFR, a new model-free neural CFR with
bootstrap learning, Neural ReCFR-B, is proposed. Due to the recursive and
non-cumulative nature of RSVs, Neural ReCFR-B has lower-variance training
targets than other neural CFRs. Experimental results show that Neural ReCFR-B
is competitive with the state-of-the-art neural CFR algorithms at a much lower
training cost.</span>

                    <span>Resting-state fMRI is commonly used for diagnosing Autism Spectrum Disorder
(ASD) by using network-based functional connectivity. It has been shown that
ASD is associated with brain regions and their inter-connections. However,
discriminating based on connectivity patterns among imaging data of the control
population and that of ASD patients&#x27; brains is a non-trivial task. In order to
tackle said classification task, we propose a novel deep learning architecture
(MHATC) consisting of multi-head attention and temporal consolidation modules
for classifying an individual as a patient of ASD. The devised architecture
results from an in-depth analysis of the limitations of current deep neural
network solutions for similar applications. Our approach is not only robust but

                    <span>Inferring reward functions from demonstrations and pairwise preferences are
auspicious approaches for aligning Reinforcement Learning (RL) agents with
human intentions. However, state-of-the art methods typically focus on learning
a single reward model, thus rendering it difficult to trade off different
reward functions from multiple experts. We propose Multi-Objective Reinforced
Active Learning (MORAL), a novel method for combining diverse demonstrations of
social norms into a Pareto-optimal policy. Through maintaining a distribution
over scalarization weights, our approach is able to interactively tune a deep
RL agent towards a variety of preferences, while eliminating the need for
computing multiple policies. We empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of
MORAL in two scenarios, which model a delivery and an emergency task that
require an agent to act in the presence of normative conflicts. Overall, we
consider our research a step towards multi-objective RL with learned rewards,
bridging the gap between current reward learning and machine ethics literature.</span>

                    <span>We propose a recurrent neural network-based spatio-temporal framework named
maskGRU for the detection and tracking of small objects in videos. While there
have been many developments in the area of object tracking in recent years,
tracking a small moving object amid other moving objects and actors (such as a
ball amid moving players in sports footage) continues to be a difficult task.
Existing spatio-temporal networks, such as convolutional Gated Recurrent Units
(convGRUs), are difficult to train and have trouble accurately tracking small
objects under such conditions. To overcome these difficulties, we developed the
maskGRU framework that uses a weighted sum of the internal hidden state
produced by a convGRU and a 3-channel mask of the tracked object&#x27;s predicted
bounding box as the hidden state to be used at the next time step of the
underlying convGRU. We believe the technique of incorporating a mask into the
hidden state through a weighted sum has two benefits: controlling the effect of
exploding gradients and introducing an attention-like mechanism into the
network by indicating where in the previous video frame the object is located.
Our experiments show that maskGRU outperforms convGRU at tracking objects that
are small relative to the video resolution even in the presence of other moving
objects.</span>

                    <span>We propose an approach to modeling irregularly spaced sequences of discrete
events. We begin with a continuous-time variant of the Transformer, which was
originally formulated (Vaswani et al., 2017) for sequences without timestamps.
We embed a possible event (or other boolean fact) at time $t$ by using
attention over the events that occurred at times $&lt; t$ (and the facts that were
true when they occurred). We control this attention using pattern-matching
logic rules that relate events and facts that share participants. These rules
determine which previous events will be attended to, as well as how to
transform the embeddings of the events and facts into the attentional queries,
keys, and values. Other logic rules describe how to change the set of facts in
response to events. Our approach closely follows Mei et al. (2020a), and adopts
their Datalog Through Time formalism for logic rules. As in that work, a domain
expert first writes a set of logic rules that establishes the set of possible
events and other facts at each time $t$. Each possible event or other fact is
embedded using a neural architecture that is derived from the rules that
established it. Our only difference from Mei et al. (2020a) is that we derive a
flatter, attention-based neural architecture whereas they used a more serial
LSTM architecture. We find that our attention-based approach performs about
equally well on the RoboCup dataset, where the logic rules play an important
role in improving performance. We also compared these two methods with two
previous attention-based methods (Zuo et al., 2020; Zhang et al., 2020a) on
simpler synthetic and real domains without logic rules, and found our proposed
approach to be at least as good, and sometimes better, than each of the other
three methods.</span>

                    <span>This paper presents an ensemble forecasting method that shows strong results
on the M4Competition dataset by decreasing feature and model selection
assumptions, termed DONUT(DO Not UTilize human assumptions). Our assumption
reductions, consisting mainly of auto-generated features and a more diverse
model pool for the ensemble, significantly outperforms the
statistical-feature-based ensemble method FFORMA by Montero-Manso et al.
(2020). Furthermore, we investigate feature extraction with a Long short-term
memory Network(LSTM) Autoencoder and find that such features contain crucial
information not captured by traditional statistical feature approaches. The
ensemble weighting model uses both LSTM features and statistical features to
combine the models accurately. Analysis of feature importance and interaction
show a slight superiority for LSTM features over the statistical ones alone.
Clustering analysis shows that different essential LSTM features are different
from most statistical features and each other. We also find that increasing the
solution space of the weighting model by augmenting the ensemble with new
models is something the weighting model learns to use, explaining part of the
accuracy gains. Lastly, we present a formal ex-post-facto analysis of optimal
combination and selection for ensembles, quantifying differences through linear
optimization on the M4 dataset. We also include a short proof that model
combination is superior to model selection, a posteriori.</span>

and move on to the next decision. Here, we show that people acquire this
ability through learning and reverse-engineer the underlying learning
mechanisms. Using a process-tracing paradigm that externalises human planning,
we find that people quickly adapt how much planning they perform to the cost
and benefit of planning. To discover the underlying metacognitive learning
mechanisms we augmented a set of reinforcement learning models with
metacognitive features and performed Bayesian model selection. Our results
suggest that the metacognitive ability to adjust the amount of planning might

                    <span>Knowledge distillation is initially introduced to utilize additional
supervision from a single teacher model for the student model training. To
boost the student performance, some recent variants attempt to exploit diverse
knowledge sources from multiple teachers. However, existing studies mainly
integrate knowledge from diverse sources by averaging over multiple teacher
predictions or combining them using other various label-free strategies, which
may mislead student in the presence of low-quality teacher predictions. To
tackle this problem, we propose Confidence-Aware Multi-teacher Knowledge
Distillation (CA-MKD), which adaptively assigns sample-wise reliability for
each teacher prediction with the help of ground-truth labels, with those
teacher predictions close to one-hot labels assigned large weights. Besides,
CA-MKD incorporates intermediate layers to further improve student performance.
Extensive experiments show that our CA-MKD consistently outperforms all
compared state-of-the-art methods across various teacher-student architectures.</span>

                    <span>It is increasingly acknowledged that a priori statistical power estimation
for planned studies with multiple model parameters is inherently a multivariate
problem. Power for individual parameters of interest cannot be reliably
estimated univariately because sampling variably in, correlation with, and
variance explained relative to one parameter will impact the power for another
parameter, all usual univariate considerations being equal. Explicit solutions
in such cases, especially for models with many parameters, are either
impractical or impossible to solve, leaving researchers with the prevailing
method of simulating power. However, point estimates for a vector of model
parameters are uncertain, and the impact of inaccuracy is unknown. In such
cases, sensitivity analysis is recommended such that multiple combinations of
possible observable parameter vectors are simulated to understand power
trade-offs. A limitation to this approach is that it is computationally
expensive to generate sufficient sensitivity combinations to accurately map the
power trade-off function in increasingly high dimensional spaces for the models
that social scientists estimate. This paper explores the efficient estimation
and graphing of statistical power for a study over varying model parameter
combinations. Optimally powering a study is crucial to ensure a minimum
probability of finding the hypothesized effect. We first demonstrate the impact
of varying parameter values on power for specific hypotheses of interest and
quantify the computational intensity of computing such a graph for a given
level of precision. Finally, we propose a simple and generalizable machine
learning inspired solution to cut the computational cost to less than 7\% of
what could be called a brute force approach. [abridged]</span>

                    <span>In many reinforcement learning (RL) applications, the observation space is
specified by human developers and restricted by physical realizations, and may
thus be subject to dramatic changes over time (e.g. increased number of
observable features). However, when the observation space changes, the previous
policy will likely fail due to the mismatch of input features, and another
policy must be trained from scratch, which is inefficient in terms of
computation and sample complexity. Following theoretical insights, we propose a
novel algorithm which extracts the latent-space dynamics in the source task,
and transfers the dynamics model to the target task to use as a model-based
regularizer. Our algorithm works for drastic changes of observation space (e.g.
from vector-based observation to image-based observation), without any
inter-task mapping or any prior knowledge of the target task. Empirical results
show that our algorithm significantly improves the efficiency and stability of
learning in the target task.</span>

                    <span>Knowledge graph embedding (KGE) has drawn great attention due to its
potential in automatic knowledge graph (KG) completion and knowledge-driven
tasks. However, recent KGE models suffer from high training cost and large
storage space, thus limiting their practicality in real-world applications. To
address this challenge, based on the latest findings in the field of
Contrastive Learning, we propose a novel KGE training framework called
Hardness-aware Low-dimensional Embedding (HaLE). Instead of the traditional
Negative Sampling, we design a new loss function based on query sampling that
can balance two important training targets, Alignment and Uniformity.
Furthermore, we analyze the hardness-aware ability of recent low-dimensional
hyperbolic models and propose a lightweight hardness-aware activation
mechanism, which can help the KGE models focus on hard instances and speed up
convergence. The experimental results show that in the limited training time,
HaLE can effectively improve the performance and training speed of KGE models
on five commonly-used datasets. The HaLE-trained models can obtain a high
prediction accuracy after training few minutes and are competitive compared to
the state-of-the-art models in both low- and high-dimensional conditions.</span>

                    <span>Lung cancer is one of the deadliest cancers, and in part its effective
diagnosis and treatment depend on the accurate delineation of the tumor.
Human-centered segmentation, which is currently the most common approach, is
subject to inter-observer variability, and is also time-consuming, considering
the fact that only experts are capable of providing annotations. Automatic and
semi-automatic tumor segmentation methods have recently shown promising
results. However, as different researchers have validated their algorithms
using various datasets and performance metrics, reliably evaluating these
methods is still an open challenge. The goal of the Lung-Originated Tumor
Segmentation from Computed Tomography Scan (LOTUS) Benchmark created through
2018 IEEE Video and Image Processing (VIP) Cup competition, is to provide a
unique dataset and pre-defined metrics, so that different researchers can
develop and evaluate their methods in a unified fashion. The 2018 VIP Cup
started with a global engagement from 42 countries to access the competition
data. At the registration stage, there were 129 members clustered into 28 teams
from 10 countries, out of which 9 teams made it to the final stage and 6 teams
successfully completed all the required tasks. In a nutshell, all the
algorithms proposed during the competition, are based on deep learning models
combined with a false positive reduction technique. Methods developed by the
three finalists show promising results in tumor segmentation, however, more
effort should be put into reducing the false positive rate. This competition
manuscript presents an overview of the VIP-Cup challenge, along with the
proposed algorithms and results.</span>

                    <span>This paper is concerned with the training of neural networks (NNs) under
semidefinite constraints. This type of training problems has recently gained
popularity since semidefinite constraints can be used to verify interesting
properties for NNs that include, e.g., the estimation of an upper bound on the
Lipschitz constant, which relates to the robustness of an NN, or the stability
of dynamic systems with NN controllers. The utilized semidefinite constraints
are based on sector constraints satisfied by the underlying activation
functions. Unfortunately, one of the biggest bottlenecks of these new results
is the required computational effort for incorporating the semidefinite
constraints into the training of NNs which is limiting their scalability to
large NNs. We address this challenge by developing interior point methods for
NN training that we implement using barrier functions for semidefinite
constraints. In order to efficiently compute the gradients of the barrier
terms, we exploit the structure of the semidefinite constraints. In
experiments, we demonstrate the superior efficiency of our training method over
previous approaches, which allows us, e.g., to use semidefinite constraints in
the training of Wasserstein generative adversarial networks, where the
discriminator must satisfy a Lipschitz condition.</span>

                    <span>Recently, deep reinforcement learning (RL) has proven its feasibility in
solving combinatorial optimization problems (COPs). The learning-to-rank
techniques have been studied in the field of information retrieval. While
several COPs can be formulated as the prioritization of input items, as is
common in the information retrieval, it has not been fully explored how the
learning-to-rank techniques can be incorporated into deep RL for COPs. In this
paper, we present the learning-to-rank distillation-based COP framework, where
a high-performance ranking policy obtained by RL for a COP can be distilled
into a non-iterative, simple model, thereby achieving a low-latency COP solver.
Specifically, we employ the approximated ranking distillation to render a
score-based ranking model learnable via gradient descent. Furthermore, we use
the efficient sequence sampling to improve the inference performance with a
limited delay. With the framework, we demonstrate that a distilled model not
only achieves comparable performance to its respective, high-performance RL,
but also provides several times faster inferences. We evaluate the framework
with several COPs such as priority-based task scheduling and multidimensional
knapsack, demonstrating the benefits of the framework in terms of inference
latency and performance.</span>

                    <span>We study the forecasting problem for traffic with dynamic, possibly
periodical, and joint spatial-temporal dependency between regions. Given the
aggregated inflow and outflow traffic of regions in a city from time slots 0 to
t-1, we predict the traffic at time t at any region. Prior arts in the area
often consider the spatial and temporal dependencies in a decoupled manner or
are rather computationally intensive in training with a large number of
hyper-parameters to tune. We propose ST-TIS, a novel, lightweight, and accurate
Spatial-Temporal Transformer with information fusion and region sampling for
traffic forecasting. ST-TIS extends the canonical Transformer with information
fusion and region sampling. The information fusion module captures the complex
spatial-temporal dependency between regions. The region sampling module is to
improve the efficiency and prediction accuracy, cutting the computation
complexity for dependency learning from $O(n^2)$ to $O(n\sqrt{n})$, where n is
the number of regions. With far fewer parameters than state-of-the-art models,
the offline training of our model is significantly faster in terms of tuning
and computation (with a reduction of up to $90\%$ on training time and network
parameters). Notwithstanding such training efficiency, extensive experiments
show that ST-TIS is substantially more accurate in online prediction than
state-of-the-art approaches (with an average improvement of up to $11\%$ on
RMSE, $14\%$ on MAPE).</span>

                    <span>Machine learning algorithms typically assume that training and test examples
are drawn from the same distribution. However, distribution shift is a common
problem in real-world applications and can cause models to perform dramatically
worse at test time. In this paper, we specifically consider the problems of
domain shifts and subpopulation shifts (eg. imbalanced data). While prior works
often seek to explicitly regularize internal representations and predictors of
the model to be domain invariant, we instead aim to regularize the whole
function without restricting the model&#x27;s internal representations. This leads
to a simple mixup-based technique which learns invariant functions via
selective augmentation called LISA. LISA selectively interpolates samples
either with the same labels but different domains or with the same domain but
different labels. We analyze a linear setting and theoretically show how LISA
leads to a smaller worst-group error. Empirically, we study the effectiveness
of LISA on nine benchmarks ranging from subpopulation shifts to domain shifts,
and we find that LISA consistently outperforms other state-of-the-art methods.</span>

                    <span>Large-scale or high-resolution geologic models usually comprise a huge number
of grid blocks, which can be computationally demanding and time-consuming to
solve with numerical simulators. Therefore, it is advantageous to upscale
geologic models (e.g., hydraulic conductivity) from fine-scale (high-resolution
grids) to coarse-scale systems. Numerical upscaling methods have been proven to
be effective and robust for coarsening geologic models, but their efficiency
remains to be improved. In this work, a deep-learning-based method is proposed
to upscale the fine-scale geologic models, which can assist to improve
upscaling efficiency significantly. In the deep learning method, a deep
convolutional neural network (CNN) is trained to approximate the relationship
between the coarse grid of hydraulic conductivity fields and the hydraulic
heads, which can then be utilized to replace the numerical solvers while
solving the flow equations for each coarse block. In addition, physical laws
(e.g., governing equations and periodic boundary conditions) can also be
incorporated into the training process of the deep CNN model, which is termed
the theory-guided convolutional neural network (TgCNN). With the physical
information considered, dependence on the data volume of training the deep
learning models can be reduced greatly. Several subsurface flow cases are
introduced to test the performance of the proposed deep-learning-based
upscaling method, including 2D and 3D cases, and isotropic and anisotropic
cases. The results show that the deep learning method can provide equivalent
upscaling accuracy to the numerical method, and efficiency can be improved
significantly compared to numerical upscaling.</span>

                    <span>Comparison of data representations is a complex multi-aspect problem that has
not enjoyed a complete solution yet. We propose a method for comparing two data
representations. We introduce the Representation Topology Divergence (RTD),
measuring the dissimilarity in multi-scale topology between two point clouds of
equal size with a one-to-one correspondence between points. The data point
clouds are allowed to lie in different ambient spaces. The RTD is one of the
few TDA-based practical methods applicable to real machine learning datasets.
Experiments show that the proposed RTD agrees with the intuitive assessment of
data representation similarity and is sensitive to its topological structure.
We apply RTD to gain insights on neural networks representations in computer
vision and NLP domains for various problems: training dynamics analysis, data
distribution shift, transfer learning, ensemble learning, disentanglement
assessment.</span>

                    <span>Unbalanced optimal transport (UOT) extends optimal transport (OT) to take
into account mass variations to compare distributions. This is crucial to make
OT successful in ML applications, making it robust to data normalization and
outliers. The baseline algorithm is Sinkhorn, but its convergence speed might
be significantly slower for UOT than for OT. In this work, we identify the
cause for this deficiency, namely the lack of a global normalization of the
iterates, which equivalently corresponds to a translation of the dual OT
potentials. Our first contribution leverages this idea to develop a provably
accelerated Sinkhorn algorithm (coined &#x27;translation invariant Sinkhorn&#x27;) for
UOT, bridging the computational gap with OT. Our second contribution focusses
on 1-D UOT and proposes a Frank-Wolfe solver applied to this translation
invariant formulation. The linear oracle of each steps amounts to solving a 1-D
OT problems, resulting in a linear time complexity per iteration. Our last
contribution extends this method to the computation of UOT barycenter of 1-D
measures. Numerical simulations showcase the convergence speed improvement
brought by these three approaches.</span>

                    <span>Embedding methods for product spaces are powerful techniques for
low-distortion and low-dimensional representation of complex data structures.
Here, we address the new problem of linear classification in product space
forms -- products of Euclidean, spherical, and hyperbolic spaces. First, we
describe novel formulations for linear classifiers on a Riemannian manifold
using geodesics and Riemannian metrics which generalize straight lines and
inner products in vector spaces. Second, we prove that linear classifiers in
$d$-dimensional space forms of any curvature have the same expressive power,
i.e., they can shatter exactly $d+1$ points. Third, we formalize linear
classifiers in product space forms, describe the first known perceptron and
support vector machine classifiers for such spaces and establish rigorous
convergence results for perceptrons. Moreover, we prove that the
Vapnik-Chervonenkis dimension of linear classifiers in a product space form of
dimension $d$ is \emph{at least} $d+1$. We support our theoretical findings
with simulations on several datasets, including synthetic data, image data, and
single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data. The results show that
classification in low-dimensional product space forms for scRNA-seq data
offers, on average, a performance improvement of $\sim15\%$ when compared to
that in Euclidean spaces of the same dimension.</span>

                    <span>Multi-view learning attempts to generate a model with a better performance by
exploiting the consensus and/or complementarity among multi-view data. However,
in terms of complementarity, most existing approaches only can find
representations with single complementarity rather than complementary
information with diversity. In this paper, to utilize both complementarity and
consistency simultaneously, give free rein to the potential of deep learning in
grasping diversity-promoting complementarity for multi-view representation
learning, we propose a novel supervised multi-view representation learning
algorithm, called Self-Attention Multi-View network with Diversity-Promoting
Complementarity (SAMVDPC), which exploits the consistency by a group of
encoders, uses self-attention to find complementary information entailing
diversity. Extensive experiments conducted on eight real-world datasets have
demonstrated the effectiveness of our proposed method, and show its superiority
over several baseline methods, which only consider single complementary
information.</span>

                    <span>In sequence-to-sequence learning, e.g., natural language generation, the
decoder relies on the attention mechanism to efficiently extract information
from the encoder. While it is common practice to draw information from only the
last encoder layer, recent work has proposed to use representations from
different encoder layers for diversified levels of information. Nonetheless,
the decoder still obtains only a single view of the source sequences, which
might lead to insufficient training of the encoder layer stack due to the
hierarchy bypassing problem. In this work, we propose layer-wise multi-view
decoding, where for each decoder layer, together with the representations from
the last encoder layer, which serve as a global view, those from other encoder
layers are supplemented for a stereoscopic view of the source sequences.
Systematic experiments and analyses show that we successfully address the
hierarchy bypassing problem, require almost negligible parameter increase, and
substantially improve the performance of sequence-to-sequence learning with
deep representations on five diverse tasks, i.e., machine translation,
abstractive summarization, image captioning, video captioning, and medical
report generation. In particular, our approach achieves new state-of-the-art
results on eight benchmark datasets, including a low-resource machine
translation dataset and two low-resource medical report generation datasets.</span>

                    <span>We outline the general framework of machine learning (ML) methods for
multi-scale dynamical modeling of condensed matter systems, and in particular
of strongly correlated electron models. Complex spatial temporal behaviors in
these systems often arise from the interplay between quasi-particles and the
emergent dynamical classical degrees of freedom, such as local lattice
distortions, spins, and order-parameters. Central to the proposed framework is
the ML energy model that, by successfully emulating the time-consuming
electronic structure calculation, can accurately predict a local energy based
on the classical field in the intermediate neighborhood. In order to properly
include the symmetry of the electron Hamiltonian, a crucial component of the ML
energy model is the descriptor that transforms the neighborhood configuration
into invariant feature variables, which are input to the learning model. A
general theory of the descriptor for the classical fields is formulated, and
two types of models are distinguished depending on the presence or absence of
an internal symmetry for the classical field. Several specific approaches to
the descriptor of the classical fields are presented. Our focus is on the
group-theoretical method that offers a systematic and rigorous approach to
compute invariants based on the bispectrum coefficients. We propose an
efficient implementation of the bispectrum method based on the concept of
reference irreducible representations. Finally, the implementations of the

                    <span>In this work we study the ranking algorithm used by F\&#x27;ed\&#x27;eration
Internationale de Football Association (FIFA); we analyze the parameters it
currently uses, show the formal probabilistic model from which it can be
derived, and optimize the latter. In particular, analyzing the games since the
introduction of the algorithm in 2018, we conclude that the game&#x27;s &quot;importance&quot;
(as defined by FIFA) used in the algorithm is counterproductive from the point
of view of the predictive capability of the algorithm. We also postulate the
algorithm to be rooted in the formal modelling principle, where the Davidson
model proposed in 1970 seems to be an excellent candidate, preserving the form
of the algorithm currently used. The results indicate that the predictive
capability of the algorithm is notably improved by using the home-field
advantage and the explicit model for the draws in the game. Moderate, but
notable improvement may be attained by introducing the weighting of the results
with the goal differential, which although not rooted in a formal modelling
principle, is compatible with the current algorithm and can be tuned to the
characteristics of the football competition.</span>

                    <span>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have recently emerged as a robust framework for
graph-structured data. They have been applied to many problems such as
knowledge graph analysis, social networks recommendation, and even Covid19
detection and vaccine developments. However, unlike other deep neural networks
such as Feed Forward Neural Networks (FFNNs), few analyses such as verification
and property inferences exist, potentially due to dynamic behaviors of GNNs,
which can take arbitrary graphs as input, whereas FFNNs which only take fixed
size numerical vectors as inputs.

This paper proposes an approach to analyze GNNs by converting them into FFNNs
and reusing existing FFNNs analyses. We discuss various designs to ensure the
scalability and accuracy of the conversions. We illustrate our method on a
study case of node classification. We believe that our approach opens new
research directions for understanding and analyzing GNNs.</span>

                    <span>Multiple medical institutions collaboratively training a model using
federated learning (FL) has become a promising solution for maximizing the
potential of data-driven models, yet the non-independent and identically
distributed (non-iid) data in medical images is still an outstanding challenge
in real-world practice. The feature heterogeneity caused by diverse scanners or
protocols introduces a drift in the learning process, in both local (client)
and global (server) optimizations, which harms the convergence as well as model
performance. Many previous works have attempted to address the non-iid issue by
tackling the drift locally or globally, but how to jointly solve the two
essentially coupled drifts is still unclear. In this work, we concentrate on
handling both local and global drifts and introduce a new harmonizing framework
called HarmoFL. First, we propose to mitigate the local update drift by
normalizing amplitudes of images transformed into the frequency domain to mimic
a unified imaging setting, in order to generate a harmonized feature space
across local clients. Second, based on harmonized features, we design a client
weight perturbation guiding each local model to reach a flat optimum, where a
neighborhood area of the local optimal solution has a uniformly low loss.
Without any extra communication cost, the perturbation assists the global model
to optimize towards a converged optimal solution by aggregating several local
flat optima. We have theoretically analyzed the proposed method and empirically
conducted extensive experiments on three medical image classification and
segmentation tasks, showing that HarmoFL outperforms a set of recent
state-of-the-art methods with promising convergence behavior. Code is available
at https://github.com/med-air/HarmoFL.</span>

                    <span>Deploying various deep learning (DL) models efficiently has boosted the
research on DL compilers. The difficulty of generating optimized tensor codes
drives DL compiler to ask for the auto-tuning approaches, and the increasing
demands require increasing auto-tuning efficiency and quality. Currently, the
DL compilers partition the input DL models into several subgraphs and leverage
the auto-tuning to find the optimal tensor codes of these subgraphs. However,
existing auto-tuning approaches usually regard subgraphs as individual ones and
overlook the similarities across them, and thus fail to exploit better tensor
codes under limited time budgets. We propose FamilySeer, an auto-tuning
framework for DL compilers that can generate better tensor codes even with
limited time budgets. FamilySeer exploits the similarities and differences
among subgraphs can organize them into subgraph families, where the tuning of
one subgraph can also improve other subgraphs within the same family. The cost
model of each family gets more purified training samples generated by the
family and becomes more accurate so that the costly measurements on real
hardware can be replaced with the lightweight estimation through cost model.
Our experiments show that FamilySeer can generate model codes with the same
code performance more efficiently than state-of-the-art auto-tuning frameworks.</span>

                    <span>Latent Gaussian models and boosting are widely used techniques in statistics
and machine learning. Tree-boosting shows excellent prediction accuracy on many
data sets, but potential drawbacks are that it assumes conditional independence
of samples, produces discontinuous predictions for, e.g., spatial data, and it
can have difficulty with high-cardinality categorical variables. Latent
Gaussian models, such as Gaussian process and grouped random effects models,
are flexible prior models which explicitly model dependence among samples and
which allow for efficient learning of predictor functions and for making
probabilistic predictions. However, existing latent Gaussian models usually
assume either a zero or a linear prior mean function which can be an
unrealistic assumption. This article introduces a novel approach that combines
boosting and latent Gaussian models to remedy the above-mentioned drawbacks and
to leverage the advantages of both techniques. We obtain increased prediction
accuracy compared to existing approaches in both simulated and real-world data
experiments.</span>

                    <span>EEG decoding systems based on deep neural networks have been widely used in
decision making of brain computer interfaces (BCI). Their predictions, however,
can be unreliable given the significant variance and noise in EEG signals.
Previous works on EEG analysis mainly focus on the exploration of noise pattern
in the source signal, while the uncertainty during the decoding process is
largely unexplored. Automatically detecting and quantifying such decoding
uncertainty is important for BCI motor imagery applications such as robotic arm
control etc. In this work, we proposed an uncertainty estimation model (UE-EEG)
to explore the uncertainty during the EEG decoding process, which considers
both the uncertainty in the input signal and the uncertainty in the model. The
model utilized dropout oriented method for model uncertainty estimation, and
Bayesian neural network is adopted for modeling the uncertainty of input data.
The model can be integrated into current widely used deep learning classifiers
without change of architecture. We performed extensive experiments for
uncertainty estimation in both intra-subject EEG decoding and cross-subject EEG
decoding on two public motor imagery datasets, where the proposed model
achieves significant improvement on the quality of estimated uncertainty and
demonstrates the proposed UE-EEG is a useful tool for BCI applications.</span>

invasive breast cancer. The mitotic cell count is one of the most common tests
to assess the aggressiveness or grade of breast cancer. In this prognosis,
histopathology images must be examined by a pathologist using high-resolution
microscopes to count the cells. Unfortunately, can be an exhaustive task with
poor reproducibility, especially for non-experts. Deep learning networks have
recently been adapted to medical applications which are able to automatically
localize these regions of interest. However, these region-based networks lack
the ability to take advantage of the segmentation features produced by a full
image CNN which are often used as a sole method of detection. Therefore, the
proposed method leverages Faster RCNN for object detection while fusing
segmentation features generated by a UNet with RGB image features to achieve an

event systems to propose a method to learn optimal control policies for a
finite-state Markov Decision Process (MDP) in which (only) certain sequences of
actions are deemed unsafe (respectively safe). We assume that the set of action
sequences that are deemed unsafe and/or safe are given in terms of a
finite-state automaton; and propose a supervisor that disables a subset of
actions at every state of the MDP so that the constraints on action sequence
are satisfied. Then we present a version of the Q-learning algorithm for
learning optimal policies in the presence of non-Markovian action-sequence and
state constraints, where we use the development of reward machines to handle
the state constraints. We illustrate the method using an example that captures
the utility of automata-based methods for non-Markovian state and action
specifications for reinforcement learning and show the results of simulations
in this setting.</span>

                    <span>Reconstructing spectral functions from Euclidean Green&#x27;s functions is an
important inverse problem in many-body physics. However, the inversion is
proved to be ill-posed in the realistic systems with noisy Green&#x27;s functions.
In this Letter, we propose an automatic differentiation(AD) framework as a
generic tool for the spectral reconstruction from propagator observable.
Exploiting the neural networks&#x27; regularization as a non-local smoothness
regulator of the spectral function, we represent spectral functions by neural
networks and use the propagator&#x27;s reconstruction error to optimize the network
parameters unsupervisedly. In the training process, except for the
positive-definite form for the spectral function, there are no other explicit
physical priors embedded into the neural networks. The reconstruction
performance is assessed through relative entropy and mean square error for two
different network representations. Compared to the maximum entropy method, the
AD framework achieves better performance in the large-noise situation. It is
noted that the freedom of introducing non-local regularization is an inherent
advantage of the present framework and may lead to substantial improvements in
solving inverse problems.</span>

                    <span>Reinforcement learning agents learn by encouraging behaviours which maximize
their total reward, usually provided by the environment. In many environments,
however, the reward is provided after a series of actions rather than each
single action, leading the agent to experience ambiguity in terms of whether
those actions are effective, an issue known as the credit assignment problem.
In this paper, we propose two strategies inspired by behavioural psychology to
enable the agent to intrinsically estimate more informative reward values for
actions with no reward. The first strategy, called self-punishment (SP),
discourages the agent from making mistakes that lead to undesirable terminal
states. The second strategy, called the rewards backfill (RB), backpropagates
the rewards between two rewarded actions. We prove that, under certain
assumptions and regardless of the reinforcement learning algorithm used, these
two strategies maintain the order of policies in the space of all possible
policies in terms of their total reward, and, by extension, maintain the
optimal policy. Hence, our proposed strategies integrate with any reinforcement
learning algorithm that learns a value or action-value function through
experience. We incorporated these two strategies into three popular deep
reinforcement learning approaches and evaluated the results on thirty Atari
games. After parameter tuning, our results indicate that the proposed
strategies improve the tested methods in over 65 percent of tested games by up
to over 25 times performance improvement.</span>

the original problem&#x27;s underlying graph structure (which is often available and

and manages things that it does not know, and learns them over time from a
non-stationary stream of data. Open-world learning is related to but also
distinct from a multitude of other learning problems and this paper briefly
analyzes the key differences between a wide range of problems including
incremental learning, generalized novelty discovery, and generalized zero-shot
learning. This paper formalizes various open-world learning problems including
open-world learning without labels. These open-world problems can be addressed
with modifications to known elements, we present a new framework that enables
agents to combine various modules for novelty-detection,
novelty-characterization, incremental learning, and instance management to
learn new classes from a stream of unlabeled data in an unsupervised manner,
survey how to adapt a few state-of-the-art techniques to fit the framework and
use them to define seven baselines for performance on the open-world learning
without labels problem. We then discuss open-world learning quality and analyze
how that can improve instance management. We also discuss some of the general

                    <span>Spectral embedding of network adjacency matrices often produces node
representations living approximately around low-dimensional submanifold
structures. In particular, hidden substructure is expected to arise when the
graph is generated from a latent position model. Furthermore, the presence of
communities within the network might generate community-specific submanifold
structures in the embedding, but this is not explicitly accounted for in most
statistical models for networks. In this article, a class of models called
latent structure block models (LSBM) is proposed to address such scenarios,
allowing for graph clustering when community-specific one dimensional manifold
structure is present. LSBMs focus on a specific class of latent space model,
the random dot product graph (RDPG), and assign a latent submanifold to the
latent positions of each community. A Bayesian model for the embeddings arising
from LSBMs is discussed, and shown to have a good performance on simulated and
real world network data. The model is able to correctly recover the underlying
communities living in a one-dimensional manifold, even when the parametric form
of the underlying curves is unknown, achieving remarkable results on a variety
of real data.</span>

                    <span>Meta-learning traditionally relies on backpropagation through entire tasks to
iteratively improve a model&#x27;s learning dynamics. However, this approach is
computationally intractable when scaled to complex tasks. We propose a
distributed evolutionary meta-learning strategy using Tensor Processing Units
(TPUs) that is highly parallel and scalable to arbitrarily long tasks with no
increase in memory cost. Using a Prototypical Network trained with evolution
strategies on the Omniglot dataset, we achieved an accuracy of 98.4% on a
5-shot classification problem. Our algorithm used as much as 40 times less
memory than automatic differentiation to compute the gradient, with the
resulting model achieving accuracy within 1.3% of a backpropagation-trained
equivalent (99.6%). We observed better classification accuracy as high as 99.1%
with larger population configurations. We further experimentally validate the
stability and performance of ES-ProtoNet across a variety of training
conditions (varying population size, model size, number of workers, shot, way,
ES hyperparameters, etc.). Our contributions are twofold: we provide the first
assessment of evolutionary meta-learning in a supervised setting, and create a

                    <span>Contrastive learning has been widely applied to graph representation
learning, where the view generators play a vital role in generating effective
contrastive samples. Most of the existing contrastive learning methods employ
pre-defined view generation methods, e.g., node drop or edge perturbation,
which usually cannot adapt to input data or preserve the original semantic
structures well. To address this issue, we propose a novel framework named
Automated Graph Contrastive Learning (AutoGCL) in this paper. Specifically,
AutoGCL employs a set of learnable graph view generators orchestrated by an
auto augmentation strategy, where every graph view generator learns a
probability distribution of graphs conditioned by the input. While the graph
view generators in AutoGCL preserve the most representative structures of the
original graph in generation of every contrastive sample, the auto augmentation
learns policies to introduce adequate augmentation variances in the whole
contrastive learning procedure. Furthermore, AutoGCL adopts a joint training
strategy to train the learnable view generators, the graph encoder, and the
classifier in an end-to-end manner, resulting in topological heterogeneity yet
semantic similarity in the generation of contrastive samples. Extensive
experiments on semi-supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and transfer
learning demonstrate the superiority of our AutoGCL framework over the
state-of-the-arts in graph contrastive learning. In addition, the visualization
results further confirm that the learnable view generators can deliver more
compact and semantically meaningful contrastive samples compared against the
existing view generation methods.</span>

                    <span>Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is a notoriously noisy
measurement of brain activity because of the large variations between
individuals, signals marred by environmental differences during collection, and
spatiotemporal averaging required by the measurement resolution. In addition,
the data is extremely high dimensional, with the space of the activity
typically having much lower intrinsic dimension. In order to understand the
connection between stimuli of interest and brain activity, and analyze
differences and commonalities between subjects, it becomes important to learn a
meaningful embedding of the data that denoises, and reveals its intrinsic
structure. Specifically, we assume that while noise varies significantly
between individuals, true responses to stimuli will share common,
low-dimensional features between subjects which are jointly discoverable.
Similar approaches have been exploited previously but they have mainly used
linear methods such as PCA and shared response modeling (SRM). In contrast, we
propose a neural network called MRMD-AE (manifold-regularized multiple decoder,
autoencoder), that learns a common embedding from multiple subjects in an
experiment while retaining the ability to decode to individual raw fMRI
signals. We show that our learned common space represents an extensible
manifold (where new points not seen during training can be mapped), improves
the classification accuracy of stimulus features of unseen timepoints, as well
as improves cross-subject translation of fMRI signals. We believe this
framework can be used for many downstream applications such as guided
brain-computer interface (BCI) training in the future.</span>

variables and arbitrary constraints on the indicators. We show that a convex
hull description of the associated mixed-integer set in an extended space with
a quadratic number of additional variables consists of a single positive
semidefinite constraint (explicitly stated) and linear constraints. In
particular, convexification of this class of problems reduces to describing a
polyhedral set in an extended formulation. We also give descriptions in the
original space of variables: we provide a description based on an infinite
number of conic-quadratic inequalities, which are &quot;finitely generated.&quot; In
particular, it is possible to characterize whether a given inequality is
necessary to describe the convex-hull. The new theory presented here unifies
several previously established results, and paves the way toward utilizing
polyhedral methods to analyze the convex hull of mixed-integer nonlinear sets.</span>

metaheuristics are needed that enhance the capabilities of classical

approaches using machine learning. In 1960, the first genetic algorithm was

                    <span>Recent natural language processing (NLP) techniques have accomplished high
performance on benchmark datasets, primarily due to the significant improvement
in the performance of deep learning. The advances in the research community
have led to great enhancements in state-of-the-art production systems for NLP
tasks, such as virtual assistants, speech recognition, and sentiment analysis.
However, such NLP systems still often fail when tested with adversarial
attacks. The initial lack of robustness exposed troubling gaps in current
models&#x27; language understanding capabilities, creating problems when NLP systems
are deployed in real life. In this paper, we present a structured overview of
NLP robustness research by summarizing the literature in a systemic way across
various dimensions. We then take a deep-dive into the various dimensions of
robustness, across techniques, metrics, embeddings, and benchmarks. Finally, we
argue that robustness should be multi-dimensional, provide insights into
current research, identify gaps in the literature to suggest directions worth
pursuing to address these gaps.</span>

                    <span>The idea of slicing divergences has been proven to be successful when
comparing two probability measures in various machine learning applications
including generative modeling, and consists in computing the expected value of
a &#x60;base divergence&#x27; between one-dimensional random projections of the two
measures. However, the topological, statistical, and computational consequences
of this technique have not yet been well-established. In this paper, we aim at
bridging this gap and derive various theoretical properties of sliced
probability divergences. First, we show that slicing preserves the metric
axioms and the weak continuity of the divergence, implying that the sliced
divergence will share similar topological properties. We then precise the
results in the case where the base divergence belongs to the class of integral
probability metrics. On the other hand, we establish that, under mild
conditions, the sample complexity of a sliced divergence does not depend on the
problem dimension. We finally apply our general results to several base
divergences, and illustrate our theory on both synthetic and real data
experiments.</span>

                    <span>Anomaly detection aims at identifying deviant instances from the normal data
distribution. Many advances have been made in the field, including the
innovative use of unsupervised contrastive learning. However, existing methods
generally assume clean training data and are limited when the data contain
unknown anomalies. This paper presents Elsa, a novel semi-supervised anomaly
detection approach that unifies the concept of energy-based models with
unsupervised contrastive learning. Elsa instills robustness against any data
contamination by a carefully designed fine-tuning step based on the new energy
function that forces the normal data to be divided into classes of prototypes.
Experiments on multiple contamination scenarios show the proposed model
achieves SOTA performance. Extensive analyses also verify the contribution of
each component in the proposed model. Beyond the experiments, we also offer a
theoretical interpretation of why contrastive learning alone cannot detect
anomalies under data contamination.</span>

over-parameterized so that they can fit the noisy training data exactly, yet
they can still achieve small test errors in practice. In this paper, we study
this &quot;benign overfitting&quot; phenomenon of the maximum margin classifier for
linear classification problems. Specifically, we consider data generated from
sub-Gaussian mixtures, and provide a tight risk bound for the maximum margin
linear classifier in the over-parameterized setting. Our results precisely
characterize the condition under which benign overfitting can occur in linear
classification problems, and improve on previous work. They also have direct

                    <span>Many past attempts at modeling repeated Cournot games assume that demand is
stationary. This does not align with real-world scenarios in which market
demands can evolve over a product&#x27;s lifetime for a myriad of reasons. In this
paper, we model repeated Cournot games with non-stationary demand such that
firms/agents face separate instances of non-stationary multi-armed bandit
problem. The set of arms/actions that an agent can choose from represents
discrete production quantities; here, the action space is ordered. Agents are
independent and autonomous, and cannot observe anything from the environment;
they can only see their own rewards after taking an action, and only work
towards maximizing these rewards. We propose a novel algorithm &#x27;Adaptive with
Weighted Exploration (AWE) $\epsilon$-greedy&#x27; which is remotely based on the
well-known $\epsilon$-greedy approach. This algorithm detects and quantifies
changes in rewards due to varying market demand and varies learning rate and
exploration rate in proportion to the degree of changes in demand, thus
enabling agents to better identify new optimal actions. For efficient
exploration, it also deploys a mechanism for weighing actions that takes
advantage of the ordered action space. We use simulations to study the
emergence of various equilibria in the market. In addition, we study the
scalability of our approach in terms number of total agents in the system and
the size of action space. We consider both symmetric and asymmetric firms in
our models. We found that using our proposed method, agents are able to swiftly
change their course of action according to the changes in demand, and they also
engage in collusive behavior in many simulations.</span>

                    <span>As machine learning powered decision making is playing an increasingly
important role in our daily lives, it is imperative to strive for fairness of
the underlying data processing and algorithms. We propose a pre-processing
algorithm for fair data representation via which L2- objective supervised
learning algorithms result in an estimation of the Pareto frontier between
prediction error and statistical disparity. In particular, the present work
applies the optimal positive definite affine transport maps to approach the
post-processing Wasserstein barycenter characterization of the optimal fair
L2-objective supervised learning via a pre-processing data deformation. We call
the resulting data Wasserstein pseudo-barycenter. Furthermore, we show that the
Wasserstein geodesics from the learning outcome marginals to the barycenter
characterizes the Pareto frontier between L2-loss and total Wasserstein
distance among learning outcome marginals. Thereby, an application of McCann
interpolation generalizes the pseudo-barycenter to a family of data
representations via which L2-objective supervised learning algorithms result in
the Pareto frontier. Numerical simulations underscore the advantages of the
proposed data representation: (1) the pre-processing step is compositive with
arbitrary L2-objective supervised learning methods and unseen data; (2) the
fair representation protects data privacy by preventing the training machine
from direct or indirect access to the sensitive information of the data; (3)
the optimal affine map results in efficient computation of fair supervised
learning on high-dimensional data; (4) experimental results shed light on the
fairness of L2-objective unsupervised learning via the proposed fair data
representation.</span>

                    <span>The advent of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) has led to their
application in several domains. One noteworthy application is the perception
system for autonomous driving that relies on the predictions from CNNs.
Practitioners evaluate the generalization ability of such CNNs by calculating
various metrics on an independent test dataset. A test dataset is often chosen
based on only one precondition, i.e., its elements are not a part of the
training data. Such a dataset may contain objects that are both similar and
novel w.r.t. the training dataset. Nevertheless, existing works do not reckon
the novelty of the test samples and treat them all equally for evaluating
generalization. Such novelty-based evaluations are of significance to validate
the fitness of a CNN in autonomous driving applications. Hence, we propose a
CNN generalization scoring framework that considers novelty of objects in the
test dataset. We begin with the representation learning technique to reduce the
image data into a low-dimensional space. It is on this space we estimate the
novelty of the test samples. Finally, we calculate the generalization score as
a combination of the test data prediction performance and novelty. We perform
an experimental study of the same for our traffic light detection application.
In addition, we systematically visualize the results for an interpretable
notion of novelty.</span>

                    <span>It is well-known that deep neural networks (DNNs) have shown remarkable
success in many fields. However, when adding an imperceptible magnitude
perturbation on the model input, the model performance might get rapid
decrease. To address this issue, a randomness technique has been proposed
recently, named Stochastic Neural Networks (SNNs). Specifically, SNNs inject
randomness into the model to defend against unseen attacks and improve the
adversarial robustness. However, existed studies on SNNs mainly focus on
injecting fixed or learnable noises to model weights/activations. In this
paper, we find that the existed SNNs performances are largely bottlenecked by
the feature representation ability. Surprisingly, simply maximizing the
variance per dimension of the feature distribution leads to a considerable
boost beyond all previous methods, which we named maximize feature distribution
variance stochastic neural network (MFDV-SNN). Extensive experiments on
well-known white- and black-box attacks show that MFDV-SNN achieves a
significant improvement over existing methods, which indicates that it is a
simple but effective method to improve model robustness.</span>

                    <span>Stochastic weight averaging (SWA) is recognized as a simple while one
effective approach to improve the generalization of stochastic gradient descent
(SGD) for training deep neural networks (DNNs). A common insight to explain its
success is that averaging weights following an SGD process equipped with
cyclical or high constant learning rates can discover wider optima, which then
lead to better generalization. We give a new insight that does not concur with
the above one. We characterize that SWA&#x27;s performance is highly dependent on to
what extent the SGD process that runs before SWA converges, and the operation
of weight averaging only contributes to variance reduction. This new insight
suggests practical guides on better algorithm design. As an instantiation, we
show that following an SGD process with insufficient convergence, running SWA
more times leads to continual incremental benefits in terms of generalization.
Our findings are corroborated by extensive experiments across different network
architectures, including a baseline CNN, PreResNet-164, WideResNet-28-10,
VGG16, ResNet-50, ResNet-152, DenseNet-161, and different datasets including
CIFAR-{10,100}, and Imagenet.</span>

                    <span>We analyze the best achievable performance of Bayesian learning under
generative models by defining and upper-bounding the minimum excess risk (MER):
the gap between the minimum expected loss attainable by learning from data and
the minimum expected loss that could be achieved if the model realization were
known. The definition of MER provides a principled way to define different
notions of uncertainties in Bayesian learning, including the aleatoric
uncertainty and the minimum epistemic uncertainty. Two methods for deriving
upper bounds for the MER are presented. The first method, generally suitable
for Bayesian learning with a parametric generative model, upper-bounds the MER
by the conditional mutual information between the model parameters and the
quantity being predicted given the observed data. It allows us to quantify the
rate at which the MER decays to zero as more data becomes available. Under
realizable models, this method also relates the MER to the richness of the
generative function class, notably the VC dimension in binary classification.
The second method, particularly suitable for Bayesian learning with a
parametric predictive model, relates the MER to the minimum estimation error of
the model parameters from data. It explicitly shows how the uncertainty in
model parameter estimation translates to the MER and to the final prediction
uncertainty. We also extend the definition and analysis of MER to the setting
with multiple model families and the setting with nonparametric models. Along
the discussions we draw some comparisons between the MER in Bayesian learning
and the excess risk in frequentist learning.</span>

                    <span>Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) are prevalent machine learning models that
have been applied across various real world classification tasks. ANNs require
a large amount of data to have strong out of sample performance, and many
algorithms for training ANN parameters are based on stochastic gradient descent
(SGD). However, the SGD ANNs that tend to perform best on prediction tasks are
trained in an end to end manner that requires a large number of model
parameters and random initialization. This means training ANNs is very time
consuming and the resulting models take a lot of memory to deploy. In order to
train more parsimonious ANN models, we propose the use of alternative methods
from the constrained optimization literature for ANN training and pretraining.
In particular, we propose novel mixed integer programming (MIP) formulations
for training fully-connected ANNs. Our formulations can account for both binary
activation and rectified linear unit (ReLU) activation ANNs, and for the use of
a log likelihood loss. We also develop a layer-wise greedy approach, a
technique adapted for reducing the number of layers in the ANN, for model
pretraining using our MIP formulations. We then present numerical experiments
comparing our MIP based methods against existing SGD based approaches and show
that we are able to achieve models with competitive out of sample performance
that are significantly more parsimonious.</span>

                    <span>Text classification is a fundamental Natural Language Processing task that
has a wide variety of applications, where deep learning approaches have
produced state-of-the-art results. While these models have been heavily
criticized for their black-box nature, their robustness to slight perturbations
in input text has been a matter of concern. In this work, we carry out a
data-focused study evaluating the impact of systematic practical perturbations
on the performance of the deep learning based text classification models like
CNN, LSTM, and BERT-based algorithms. The perturbations are induced by the
addition and removal of unwanted tokens like punctuation and stop-words that
are minimally associated with the final performance of the model. We show that
these deep learning approaches including BERT are sensitive to such legitimate
input perturbations on four standard benchmark datasets SST2, TREC-6, BBC News,
and tweet_eval. We observe that BERT is more susceptible to the removal of
tokens as compared to the addition of tokens. Moreover, LSTM is slightly more
sensitive to input perturbations as compared to CNN based model. The work also
serves as a practical guide to assessing the impact of discrepancies in
train-test conditions on the final performance of models.</span>

                    <span>In the last decades, scene text recognition has gained worldwide attention
from both the academic community and actual users due to its importance in a
wide range of applications. Despite achievements in optical character
recognition, scene text recognition remains challenging due to inherent
problems such as distortions or irregular layout. Most of the existing
approaches mainly leverage recurrence or convolution-based neural networks.
However, while recurrent neural networks (RNNs) usually suffer from slow
training speed due to sequential computation and encounter problems as
vanishing gradient or bottleneck, CNN endures a trade-off between complexity
and performance. In this paper, we introduce SAFL, a self-attention-based
neural network model with the focal loss for scene text recognition, to
overcome the limitation of the existing approaches. The use of focal loss
instead of negative log-likelihood helps the model focus more on low-frequency
samples training. Moreover, to deal with the distortions and irregular texts,
we exploit Spatial TransformerNetwork (STN) to rectify text before passing to
the recognition network. We perform experiments to compare the performance of
the proposed model with seven benchmarks. The numerical results show that our
model achieves the best performance.</span>

                    <span>A support vector machine (SVM) is an algorithm which finds a hyperplane that
optimally separates labeled data points in $\mathbb{R}^n$ into positive and
negative classes. The data points on the margin of this separating hyperplane
are called support vectors. We connect the possible configurations of support
vectors to Radon&#x27;s theorem, which provides guarantees for when a set of points
can be divided into two classes (positive and negative) whose convex hulls
intersect. If the convex hulls of the positive and negative support vectors are
projected onto a separating hyperplane, the projections intersect in at least
one point if and only if the hyperplane is optimal. Further, with a particular
type of general position, we show that (a) the projected convex hulls of the
support vectors intersect in exactly one point, (b) the support vectors are
stable under perturbation, (c) there are at most $n+1$ support vectors, and (d)
every number of support vectors from 2 up to $n+1$ is possible. Finally, we
perform computer simulations studying the expected number of support vectors,
and their configurations, for randomly generated data. We observe that as the
distance between classes of points increases for this type of randomly
generated data, configurations with two support vectors become the most likely
configurations.</span>

                    <span>We study the continuity property of the generalized entropy as a function of
the underlying probability distribution, defined with an action space and a
loss function, and use this property to answer the basic questions in
statistical learning theory: the excess risk analyses for various learning
methods. We first derive upper and lower bounds for the entropy difference of
two distributions in terms of several commonly used f-divergences, the
Wasserstein distance, a distance that depends on the action space and the loss
function, and the Bregman divergence generated by the entropy, which also
induces bounds in terms of the Euclidean distance between the two
distributions. Examples are given along with the discussion of each general
result, comparisons are made with the existing entropy difference bounds, and
new mutual information upper bounds are derived based on the new results. We
then apply the entropy difference bounds to the theory of statistical learning.
It is shown that the excess risks in the two popular learning paradigms, the
frequentist learning and the Bayesian learning, both can be studied with the
continuity property of different forms of the generalized entropy. The analysis
is then extended to the continuity of generalized conditional entropy. The
extension provides performance bounds for Bayes decision making with mismatched
distributions. It also leads to excess risk bounds for a third paradigm of
learning, where the decision rule is optimally designed under the projection of
the empirical distribution to a predefined family of distributions. We thus
establish a unified method of excess risk analysis for the three major
paradigms of statistical learning, through the continuity of generalized
entropy.</span>

                    <span>One major drawback of deep neural networks (DNNs) for use in sensitive
application domains is their black-box nature. This makes it hard to verify or
monitor complex, symbolic requirements. In this work, we present a simple, yet
effective, approach to verify whether a trained convolutional neural network
(CNN) respects specified symbolic background knowledge. The knowledge may
consist of any fuzzy predicate logic rules. For this, we utilize methods from
explainable artificial intelligence (XAI): First, using concept embedding
analysis, the output of a computer vision CNN is post-hoc enriched by concept
outputs; second, logical rules from prior knowledge are fuzzified to serve as
continuous-valued functions on the concept outputs. These can be evaluated with
little computational overhead. We demonstrate three diverse use-cases of our
method on stateof-the-art object detectors: Finding corner cases, utilizing the
rules for detecting and localizing DNN misbehavior during runtime, and
comparing the logical consistency of DNNs. The latter is used to find related
differences between EfficientDet D1 and Mask R-CNN object detectors. We show
that this approach benefits from fuzziness and calibrating the concept outputs.</span>

                    <span>Although it is well known that exploration plays a key role in Reinforcement
Learning (RL), prevailing exploration strategies for continuous control tasks
in RL are mainly based on naive isotropic Gaussian noise regardless of the
causality relationship between action space and the task and consider all
dimensions of actions equally important. In this work, we propose to conduct
interventions on the primal action space to discover the causal relationship
between the action space and the task reward. We propose the method of
State-Wise Action Refined (SWAR), which addresses the issue of action space
redundancy and promote causality discovery in RL. We formulate causality
discovery in RL tasks as a state-dependent action space selection problem and
propose two practical algorithms as solutions. The first approach, TD-SWAR,
detects task-related actions during temporal difference learning, while the
second approach, Dyn-SWAR, reveals important actions through dynamic model
prediction. Empirically, both methods provide approaches to understand the
decisions made by RL agents and improve learning efficiency in action-redundant
tasks.</span>

services are continuously buying new video content to mine the potential profit
from them. As such, the newly added content has to be handled well to be
recommended to suitable users. In this paper, we address the new item
cold-start problem by exploring the potential of various deep learning features
to provide video recommendations. The deep learning features investigated
include features that capture the visual-appearance, audio and motion
information from video content. We also explore different fusion methods to
evaluate how well these feature modalities can be combined to fully exploit the
complementary information captured by them. Experiments on a real-world video
dataset for movie recommendations show that deep learning features outperform
hand-crafted features. In particular, recommendations generated with deep
learning audio features and action-centric deep learning features are superior
to MFCC and state-of-the-art iDT features. In addition, the combination of
various deep learning features with hand-crafted features and textual metadata
yields significant improvement in recommendations compared to combining only
the former.</span>

                    <span>Reinforcement learning (RL) has drawn increasing interests in recent years
due to its tremendous success in various applications. However, standard RL
algorithms can only be applied for single reward function, and cannot adapt to
an unseen reward function quickly. In this paper, we advocate a general
operator view of reinforcement learning, which enables us to directly
approximate the operator that maps from reward function to value function. The
benefit of learning the operator is that we can incorporate any new reward
function as input and attain its corresponding value function in a zero-shot
manner. To approximate this special type of operator, we design a number of
novel operator neural network architectures based on its theoretical
properties. Our design of operator networks outperform the existing methods and
the standard design of general purpose operator network, and we demonstrate the
benefit of our operator deep Q-learning framework in several tasks including
reward transferring for offline policy evaluation (OPE) and reward transferring
for offline policy optimization in a range of tasks.</span>

                    <span>Vision transformers (ViT) have recently attracted considerable attentions,
but the huge computational cost remains an issue for practical deployment.
Previous ViT pruning methods tend to prune the model along one dimension
solely, which may suffer from excessive reduction and lead to sub-optimal model
quality. In contrast, we advocate a multi-dimensional ViT compression paradigm,
and propose to harness the redundancy reduction from attention head, neuron and
sequence dimensions jointly. We firstly propose a statistical dependence based
pruning criterion that is generalizable to different dimensions for identifying
deleterious components. Moreover, we cast the multi-dimensional compression as
an optimization, learning the optimal pruning policy across the three
dimensions that maximizes the compressed model&#x27;s accuracy under a computational
budget. The problem is solved by our adapted Gaussian process search with
expected improvement. Experimental results show that our method effectively
reduces the computational cost of various ViT models. For example, our method
reduces 40\% FLOPs without top-1 accuracy loss for DeiT and T2T-ViT models,
outperforming previous state-of-the-arts.</span>

to interpret noisy temperature data with a smoothing filter applied. However,
the ML methods also performed well and they are can better identify a reduced
number of important observations, which could be useful for measurement network
optimization. Surprisingly, the ML and DL methods better inferred upward flux
than downward flux. This is in direct contrast to previous findings using

2.68 million inventors and provide novel descriptive evidence regarding their
ethnic origin composition over time and across countries and technological
fields. The global ethnic origin composition has become more diverse over the
last decades, which was mostly due to a relative increase of Asian origin
inventors. Furthermore, the prevalence of foreign-origin inventors is
especially high in the USA, but has also increased in other high-income
economies. This increase was mainly driven by an inflow of non-western
inventors into emerging high-technology fields for the USA, but not for other
high-income countries.</span>

                    <span>Detecting and labeling stance in social media text is strongly motivated by
hate speech detection, poll prediction, engagement forecasting, and concerted
propaganda detection. Today&#x27;s best neural stance detectors need large volumes
of training data, which is difficult to curate given the fast-changing
landscape of social media text and issues on which users opine. Homophily
properties over the social network provide strong signal of coarse-grained
user-level stance. But semi-supervised approaches for tweet-level stance
detection fail to properly leverage homophily. In light of this, We present
SANDS, a new semi-supervised stance detector. SANDS starts from very few
labeled tweets. It builds multiple deep feature views of tweets. It also uses a
distant supervision signal from the social network to provide a surrogate loss
signal to the component learners. We prepare two new tweet datasets comprising
over 236,000 politically tinted tweets from two demographics (US and India)
posted by over 87,000 users, their follower-followee graph, and over 8,000
tweets annotated by linguists. SANDS achieves a macro-F1 score of 0.55 (0.49)
on US (India)-based datasets, outperforming 17 baselines (including variants of
SANDS) substantially, particularly for minority stance labels and noisy text.
Numerous ablation experiments on SANDS disentangle the dynamics of textual and
network-propagated stance signals.</span>

                    <span>Unsupervised anomaly detection aims to build models to effectively detect
unseen anomalies by only training on the normal data. Although previous
reconstruction-based methods have made fruitful progress, their generalization
ability is limited due to two critical challenges. First, the training dataset
only contains normal patterns, which limits the model generalization ability.
Second, the feature representations learned by existing models often lack
representativeness which hampers the ability to preserve the diversity of
normal patterns. In this paper, we propose a novel approach called Adaptive
Memory Network with Self-supervised Learning (AMSL) to address these challenges
and enhance the generalization ability in unsupervised anomaly detection. Based
on the convolutional autoencoder structure, AMSL incorporates a self-supervised
learning module to learn general normal patterns and an adaptive memory fusion
module to learn rich feature representations. Experiments on four public
multivariate time series datasets demonstrate that AMSL significantly improves
the performance compared to other state-of-the-art methods. Specifically, on
the largest CAP sleep stage detection dataset with 900 million samples, AMSL
outperforms the second-best baseline by \textbf{4}\%+ in both accuracy and F1
score. Apart from the enhanced generalization ability, AMSL is also more robust
against input noise.</span>

                    <span>Recent years have witnessed the increasing popularity of Location-based
Social Network (LBSN) services, which provides unparalleled opportunities to
build personalized Point-of-Interest (POI) recommender systems. Existing POI
recommendation and location prediction tasks utilize past information for
future recommendation or prediction from a single direction perspective, while
the missing POI category identification task needs to utilize the check-in
information both before and after the missing category. Therefore, a
long-standing challenge is how to effectively identify the missing POI
categories at any time in the real-world check-in data of mobile users. To this
end, in this paper, we propose a novel neural network approach to identify the
missing POI categories by integrating both bi-directional global non-personal
transition patterns and personal preferences of users. Specifically, we
delicately design an attention matching cell to model how well the check-in
category information matches their non-personal transition patterns and
personal preferences. Finally, we evaluate our model on two real-world
datasets, which clearly validate its effectiveness compared with the
state-of-the-art baselines. Furthermore, our model can be naturally extended to
address next POI category recommendation and prediction tasks with competitive
performance.</span>

                    <span>Computing the Bayesian posterior of a neural network is a challenging task
due to the high-dimensionality of the parameter space. Anchored ensembles
approximate the posterior by training an ensemble of neural networks on
anchored losses designed for the optima to follow the Bayesian posterior.
Training an ensemble, however, becomes computationally expensive as its number
of members grows since the full training procedure is repeated for each member.
In this note, we present Sequential Anchored Ensembles (SAE), a lightweight
alternative to anchored ensembles. Instead of training each member of the
ensemble from scratch, the members are trained sequentially on losses sampled
with high auto-correlation, hence enabling fast convergence of the neural
networks and efficient approximation of the Bayesian posterior. SAE outperform
anchored ensembles, for a given computational budget, on some benchmarks while
showing comparable performance on the others and achieved 2nd and 3rd place in
the light and extended tracks of the NeurIPS 2021 Approximate Inference in
Bayesian Deep Learning competition.</span>

lower and upper triangular matrices. And now, matrix decomposition has become a
core technology in machine learning, largely due to the development of the back

adjust production and distribution in anticipation of major variations. This
systematic review analyzes 240 works published in scholarly journals between
2000 and 2019 that focus on applying Artificial Intelligence (AI), statistical,
and hybrid models to short-term load forecasting (STLF). This work represents
the most comprehensive review of works on this subject to date. A complete
analysis of the literature is conducted to identify the most popular and
accurate techniques as well as existing gaps. The findings show that although
Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) continue to be the most commonly used
standalone technique, researchers have been exceedingly opting for hybrid
combinations of different techniques to leverage the combined advantages of
individual methods. The review demonstrates that it is commonly possible with
these hybrid combinations to achieve prediction accuracy exceeding 99%. The
most successful duration for short-term forecasting has been identified as
prediction for a duration of one day at an hourly interval. The review has

Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) algorithm. It is an example of one of
the most popular paradigms of Deep Reinforcement Learning (DeepRL) for tackling
continuous action spaces: the actor-critic paradigm. In the setting considered
herein, each agent observes a part of the global state space in order to take
local actions, for which it receives local rewards. For every agent, DDPG
trains a local actor (policy) and a local critic (Q-function). The analysis
shows that multi-agent DDPG using neural networks to approximate the local
policies and critics converge to limits with the following properties: The
critic limits minimize the average squared Bellman loss; the actor limits
parameterize a policy that maximizes the local critic&#x27;s approximation of
$Q_i^*$, where $i$ is the agent index. The averaging is with respect to a
probability distribution over the global state-action space. It captures the
asymptotics of all local training processes. Finally, we extend the analysis to
a fully decentralized setting where agents communicate over a wireless network
prone to delays and losses; a typical scenario in, e.g., robotic applications.</span>

                    <span>Graph kernels are historically the most widely-used technique for graph
classification tasks. However, these methods suffer from limited performance
because of the hand-crafted combinatorial features of graphs. In recent years,
graph neural networks (GNNs) have become the state-of-the-art method in
downstream graph-related tasks due to their superior performance. Most GNNs are
based on Message Passing Neural Network (MPNN) frameworks. However, recent
studies show that MPNNs can not exceed the power of the Weisfeiler-Lehman (WL)
algorithm in graph isomorphism test. To address the limitations of existing
graph kernel and GNN methods, in this paper, we propose a novel GNN framework,
termed \textit{Kernel Graph Neural Networks} (KerGNNs), which integrates graph
kernels into the message passing process of GNNs. Inspired by convolution
filters in convolutional neural networks (CNNs), KerGNNs adopt trainable hidden
graphs as graph filters which are combined with subgraphs to update node
embeddings using graph kernels. In addition, we show that MPNNs can be viewed
as special cases of KerGNNs. We apply KerGNNs to multiple graph-related tasks
and use cross-validation to make fair comparisons with benchmarks. We show that
our method achieves competitive performance compared with existing
state-of-the-art methods, demonstrating the potential to increase the
representation ability of GNNs. We also show that the trained graph filters in
KerGNNs can reveal the local graph structures of the dataset, which
significantly improves the model interpretability compared with conventional
GNN models.</span>

                    <span>A key challenge for AI is to build embodied systems that operate in
dynamically changing environments. Such systems must adapt to changing task
contexts and learn continuously. Although standard deep learning systems
achieve state of the art results on static benchmarks, they often struggle in
dynamic scenarios. In these settings, error signals from multiple contexts can
interfere with one another, ultimately leading to a phenomenon known as
catastrophic forgetting. In this article we investigate biologically inspired
architectures as solutions to these problems. Specifically, we show that the
biophysical properties of dendrites and local inhibitory systems enable
networks to dynamically restrict and route information in a context-specific
manner. Our key contributions are as follows. First, we propose a novel
artificial neural network architecture that incorporates active dendrites and
sparse representations into the standard deep learning framework. Next, we
study the performance of this architecture on two separate benchmarks requiring
task-based adaptation: Meta-World, a multi-task reinforcement learning
environment where a robotic agent must learn to solve a variety of manipulation
tasks simultaneously; and a continual learning benchmark in which the model&#x27;s
prediction task changes throughout training. Analysis on both benchmarks
demonstrates the emergence of overlapping but distinct and sparse subnetworks,
allowing the system to fluidly learn multiple tasks with minimal forgetting.
Our neural implementation marks the first time a single architecture has
achieved competitive results on both multi-task and continual learning
settings. Our research sheds light on how biological properties of neurons can
inform deep learning systems to address dynamic scenarios that are typically
impossible for traditional ANNs to solve.</span>

                    <span>Deep neural networks are parametrized by several thousands or millions of
parameters, and have shown tremendous success in many classification problems.
However, the large number of parameters makes it difficult to integrate these
models into edge devices such as smartphones and wearable devices. To address
this problem, knowledge distillation (KD) has been widely employed, that uses a
pre-trained high capacity network to train a much smaller network, suitable for
edge devices. In this paper, for the first time, we study the applicability and
challenges of using KD for time-series data for wearable devices. Successful
application of KD requires specific choices of data augmentation methods during
training. However, it is not yet known if there exists a coherent strategy for
choosing an augmentation approach during KD. In this paper, we report the
results of a detailed study that compares and contrasts various common choices
and some hybrid data augmentation strategies in KD based human activity
analysis. Research in this area is often limited as there are not many
comprehensive databases available in the public domain from wearable devices.
Our study considers databases from small scale publicly available to one
derived from a large scale interventional study into human activity and
sedentary behavior. We find that the choice of data augmentation techniques
during KD have a variable level of impact on end performance, and find that the
optimal network choice as well as data augmentation strategies are specific to
a dataset at hand. However, we also conclude with a general set of
recommendations that can provide a strong baseline performance across
databases.</span>

                    <span>Air pollution monitoring platforms play a very important role in preventing
and mitigating the effects of pollution. Recent advances in the field of graph
signal processing have made it possible to describe and analyze air pollution
monitoring networks using graphs. One of the main applications is the
reconstruction of the measured signal in a graph using a subset of sensors.
Reconstructing the signal using information from sensor neighbors can help
improve the quality of network data, examples are filling in missing data with
correlated neighboring nodes, or correcting a drifting sensor with neighboring
sensors that are more accurate. This paper compares the use of various types of
graph signal reconstruction methods applied to real data sets of Spanish air
pollution reference stations. The methods considered are Laplacian
interpolation, graph signal processing low-pass based graph signal
reconstruction, and kernel-based graph signal reconstruction, and are compared
on actual air pollution data sets measuring O3, NO2, and PM10. The ability of
the methods to reconstruct the signal of a pollutant is shown, as well as the
computational cost of this reconstruction. The results indicate the superiority
of methods based on kernel-based graph signal reconstruction, as well as the
difficulties of the methods to scale in an air pollution monitoring network
with a large number of low-cost sensors. However, we show that scalability can
be overcome with simple methods, such as partitioning the network using a
clustering algorithm.</span>

                    <span>This paper proposes an efficient federated distillation learning system
(EFDLS) for multi-task time series classification (TSC). EFDLS consists of a
central server and multiple mobile users, where different users may run
different TSC tasks. EFDLS has two novel components, namely a feature-based
student-teacher (FBST) framework and a distance-based weights matching (DBWM)
scheme. Within each user, the FBST framework transfers knowledge from its
teacher&#x27;s hidden layers to its student&#x27;s hidden layers via knowledge
distillation, with the teacher and student having identical network structure.
For each connected user, its student model&#x27;s hidden layers&#x27; weights are
uploaded to the EFDLS server periodically. The DBWM scheme is deployed on the
server, with the least square distance used to measure the similarity between
the weights of two given models. This scheme finds a partner for each connected
user such that the user&#x27;s and its partner&#x27;s weights are the closest among all
the weights uploaded. The server exchanges and sends back the user&#x27;s and its
partner&#x27;s weights to these two users which then load the received weights to
their teachers&#x27; hidden layers. Experimental results show that the proposed
EFDLS achieves excellent performance on a set of selected UCR2018 datasets
regarding top-1 accuracy.</span>

                    <span>Event analysis from news and social networks is very useful for a wide range
of social studies and real-world applications. Recently, event graphs have been
explored to model event datasets and their complex relationships, where events
are vertices connected to other vertices representing locations, people&#x27;s
names, dates, and various other event metadata. Graph representation learning
methods are promising for extracting latent features from event graphs to
enable the use of different classification algorithms. However, existing
methods fail to meet essential requirements for event graphs, such as (i)
dealing with semi-supervised graph embedding to take advantage of some labeled
events, (ii) automatically determining the importance of the relationships
between event vertices and their metadata vertices, as well as (iii) dealing
with the graph heterogeneity. This paper presents GNEE (GAT Neural Event
Embeddings), a method that combines Graph Attention Networks and Graph
Regularization. First, an event graph regularization is proposed to ensure that
all graph vertices receive event features, thereby mitigating the graph
heterogeneity drawback. Second, semi-supervised graph embedding with
self-attention mechanism considers existing labeled events, as well as learns
the importance of relationships in the event graph during the representation
learning process. A statistical analysis of experimental results with five
real-world event graphs and six graph embedding methods shows that our GNEE
outperforms state-of-the-art semi-supervised graph embedding methods.</span>

                    <span>This paper introduces the Confidence Optimization (CO) score to directly
measure the contribution of heatmaps/saliency maps to the classification
performance of a model. Common heatmap generation methods used in the
eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) community are tested through a
process we call the Augmentative eXplanation (AX). We find a surprising
\textit{gap} in CO scores distribution on these heatmap methods. The gap
potentially serves as a novel indicator for the correctness of deep neural
network (DNN) prediction. We further introduces Generative AX (GAX) method to
generate saliency maps capable of attaining high CO scores. Using GAX, we also
qualitatively demonstrate the unintuitiveness of DNN architectures.</span>

                    <span>Recent advances in artificial intelligence applied to biomedical text are
opening exciting opportunities for improving pharmacovigilance activities
currently burdened by the ever growing volumes of real world data. To fully
realize these opportunities, existing regulatory guidance and industry best
practices should be taken into consideration in order to increase the overall
trustworthiness of the system and enable broader adoption. In this paper we
present a case study on how to operationalize existing guidance for validated
AI systems in pharmacovigilance focusing on the specific task of medical
literature monitoring (MLM) of adverse events from the scientific literature.
We describe an AI system designed with the goal of reducing effort in MLM
activities built in close collaboration with subject matter experts and
considering guidance for validated systems in pharmacovigilance and AI
transparency. In particular we make use of public disclosures as a useful risk
control measure to mitigate system misuse and earn user trust. In addition we
present experimental results showing the system can significantly remove
screening effort while maintaining high levels of recall (filtering 55% of
irrelevant articles on average, for a target recall of 0.99 on suspected
adverse articles) and provide a robust method for tuning the desired recall to
suit a particular risk profile.</span>

                    <span>Hospital length of stay (LOS) is one of the most essential healthcare metrics
that reflects the hospital quality of service and helps improve hospital
scheduling and management. LOS prediction helps in cost management because
patients who remain in hospitals usually do so in hospital units where
resources are severely limited. In this study, we reviewed papers on LOS
prediction using machine learning and statistical approaches. Our literature
review considers research studies that focus on LOS prediction for stroke
patients. Some of the surveyed studies revealed that authors reached
contradicting conclusions. For example, the age of the patient was considered
an important predictor of LOS for stroke patients in some studies, while other
studies concluded that age was not a significant factor. Therefore, additional
research is required in this domain to further understand the predictors of LOS
for stroke patients.</span>

Convolutional neural networks (CNNs), a type of deep learning, can removes such

                    <span>Neural machine translation (NMT) systems aim to map text from one language
into another. While there are a wide variety of applications of NMT, one of the
most important is translation of natural language. A distinguishing factor of
natural language is that words are typically ordered according to the rules of
the grammar of a given language. Although many advances have been made in
developing NMT systems for translating natural language, little research has
been done on understanding how the word ordering of and lexical similarity
between the source and target language affect translation performance. Here, we
investigate these relationships on a variety of low-resource language pairs
from the OpenSubtitles2016 database, where the source language is English, and
find that the more similar the target language is to English, the greater the
translation performance. In addition, we study the impact of providing NMT
models with part of speech of words (POS) in the English sequence and find
that, for Transformer-based models, the more dissimilar the target language is
from English, the greater the benefit provided by POS.</span>

                    <span>We aim to provably complete a sparse and highly-missing tensor in the
presence of covariate information along tensor modes. Our motivation comes from
online advertising where users click-through-rates (CTR) on ads over various
devices form a CTR tensor that has about 96% missing entries and has many zeros
on non-missing entries, which makes the standalone tensor completion method
unsatisfactory. Beside the CTR tensor, additional ad features or user
characteristics are often available. In this paper, we propose
Covariate-assisted Sparse Tensor Completion (COSTCO) to incorporate covariate
information for the recovery of the sparse tensor. The key idea is to jointly
extract latent components from both the tensor and the covariate matrix to
learn a synthetic representation. Theoretically, we derive the error bound for
the recovered tensor components and explicitly quantify the improvements on
both the reveal probability condition and the tensor recovery accuracy due to
covariates. Finally, we apply COSTCO to an advertisement dataset consisting of
a CTR tensor and ad covariate matrix, leading to 23% accuracy improvement over
the baseline. An important by-product is that ad latent components from COSTCO
reveal interesting ad clusters, which are useful for better ad targeting.</span>

                    <span>In recent years, a variety of gradient-based methods have been developed to
solve Bi-Level Optimization (BLO) problems in machine learning and computer
vision areas. However, the theoretical correctness and practical effectiveness
of these existing approaches always rely on some restrictive conditions (e.g.,
Lower-Level Singleton, LLS), which could hardly be satisfied in real-world
applications. Moreover, previous literature only proves theoretical results
based on their specific iteration strategies, thus lack a general recipe to
uniformly analyze the convergence behaviors of different gradient-based BLOs.
In this work, we formulate BLOs from an optimistic bi-level viewpoint and
establish a new gradient-based algorithmic framework, named Bi-level Descent
Aggregation (BDA), to partially address the above issues. Specifically, BDA
provides a modularized structure to hierarchically aggregate both the upper-
and lower-level subproblems to generate our bi-level iterative dynamics.
Theoretically, we establish a general convergence analysis template and derive
a new proof recipe to investigate the essential theoretical properties of
gradient-based BLO methods. Furthermore, this work systematically explores the
convergence behavior of BDA in different optimization scenarios, i.e.,
considering various solution qualities (i.e., global/local/stationary solution)
returned from solving approximation subproblems. Extensive experiments justify
our theoretical results and demonstrate the superiority of the proposed
algorithm for hyper-parameter optimization and meta-learning tasks. Source code
is available at https://github.com/vis-opt-group/BDA.</span>

                    <span>While neural networks have shown remarkable success on classification tasks
in terms of average-case performance, they often fail to perform well on
certain groups of the data. Such group information may be expensive to obtain;
thus, recent works in robustness and fairness have proposed ways to improve
worst-group performance even when group labels are unavailable for the training
data. However, these methods generally underperform methods that utilize group
information at training time. In this work, we assume access to a small number
of group labels alongside a larger dataset without group labels. We propose
BARACK, a simple two-step framework to utilize this partial group information
to improve worst-group performance: train a model to predict the missing group
labels for the training data, and then use these predicted group labels in a
robust optimization objective. Theoretically, we provide generalization bounds
for our approach in terms of the worst-group performance, showing how the
generalization error scales with respect to both the total number of training
points and the number of training points with group labels. Empirically, our
method outperforms the baselines that do not use group information, even when
only 1-33% of points have group labels. We provide ablation studies to support
the robustness and extensibility of our framework.</span>

                    <span>A common challenge in large-scale supervised learning, is how to exploit new
incremental data to a pre-trained model, without re-training the model from
scratch. Motivated by this problem, we revisit the canonical problem of dynamic
least-squares regression (LSR), where the goal is to learn a linear model over
incremental training data. In this setup, data and labels $(\mathbf{A}^{(t)},
\mathbf{b}^{(t)}) \in \mathbb{R}^{t \times d}\times \mathbb{R}^t$ evolve in an
online fashion ($t\gg d$), and the goal is to efficiently maintain an
(approximate) solution to $\min_{\mathbf{x}^{(t)}} \| \mathbf{A}^{(t)}
\mathbf{x}^{(t)} - \mathbf{b}^{(t)} \|_2$ for all $t\in [T]$. Our main result
is a dynamic data structure which maintains an arbitrarily small constant
approximate solution to dynamic LSR with amortized update time $O(d^{1+o(1)})$,
almost matching the running time of the static (sketching-based) solution. By
contrast, for exact (or even $1/\mathrm{poly}(n)$-accuracy) solutions, we show
a separation between the static and dynamic settings, namely, that dynamic LSR
requires $\Omega(d^{2-o(1)})$ amortized update time under the OMv Conjecture
(Henzinger et al., STOC&#x27;15). Our data structure is conceptually simple, easy to
implement, and fast both in theory and practice, as corroborated by experiments
over both synthetic and real-world datasets.</span>

generated samples often relies on human evaluation, which is subjective and
costly. We focus on designing a homogeneous, objective framework for evaluating
samples of algorithmically generated music. Any engineered measures to evaluate
generated music typically attempt to define the samples&#x27; musicality, but do not
capture qualities of music such as theme or mood. We do not seek to assess the
musical merit of generated music, but instead explore whether generated samples
contain meaningful information pertaining to emotion or mood/theme. We achieve
this by measuring the change in predictive performance of a music mood/theme
classifier after augmenting its training data with generated samples. We
analyse music samples generated by three models -- SampleRNN, Jukebox, and DDSP
-- and employ a homogeneous framework across all methods to allow for objective
comparison. This is the first attempt at augmenting a music genre
classification dataset with conditionally generated music. We investigate the
classification performance improvement using deep music generation and the
ability of the generators to make emotional music by using an additional,
emotion annotation of the dataset. Finally, we use a classifier trained on real
data to evaluate the label validity of class-conditionally generated samples.</span>

comprehensively, so multi-view learning has attracted widespread attention.
Traditional subspace clustering methods, such as sparse subspace clustering
(SSC) and low-ranking subspace clustering (LRSC), cluster the affinity matrix
for a single view, thus ignoring the problem of fusion between views. In our
article, we propose a new Multiview Subspace Adaptive Learning based on
Attention and Autoencoder (MSALAA). This method combines a deep autoencoder and
a method for aligning the self-representations of various views in Multi-view
Low-Rank Sparse Subspace Clustering (MLRSSC), which can not only increase the
capability to non-linearity fitting, but also can meets the principles of
consistency and complementarity of multi-view learning. We empirically observe
significant improvement over existing baseline methods on six real-life

where concepts can be referred to in different ways, using different synonyms.
In this paper, we present a deep learning based approach to build a semantic

                    <span>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have shown their great ability in modeling graph
structured data. However, real-world graphs usually contain structure noises
and have limited labeled nodes. The performance of GNNs would drop
significantly when trained on such graphs, which hinders the adoption of GNNs
on many applications. Thus, it is important to develop noise-resistant GNNs
with limited labeled nodes. However, the work on this is rather limited.
Therefore, we study a novel problem of developing robust GNNs on noisy graphs
with limited labeled nodes. Our analysis shows that both the noisy edges and
limited labeled nodes could harm the message-passing mechanism of GNNs. To
mitigate these issues, we propose a novel framework which adopts the noisy
edges as supervision to learn a denoised and dense graph, which can down-weight
or eliminate noisy edges and facilitate message passing of GNNs to alleviate
the issue of limited labeled nodes. The generated edges are further used to
regularize the predictions of unlabeled nodes with label smoothness to better
train GNNs. Experimental results on real-world datasets demonstrate the
robustness of the proposed framework on noisy graphs with limited labeled
nodes.</span>

                    <span>The dynamic job-shop scheduling problem (DJSP) is a class of scheduling tasks
that specifically consider the inherent uncertainties such as changing order
requirements and possible machine breakdown in realistic smart manufacturing
settings. Since traditional methods cannot dynamically generate effective
scheduling strategies in face of the disturbance of environments, we formulate
the DJSP as a Markov decision process (MDP) to be tackled by reinforcement
learning (RL). For this purpose, we propose a flexible hybrid framework that
takes disjunctive graphs as states and a set of general dispatching rules as
the action space with minimum prior domain knowledge. The attention mechanism
is used as the graph representation learning (GRL) module for the feature
extraction of states, and the double dueling deep Q-network with prioritized
replay and noisy networks (D3QPN) is employed to map each state to the most
appropriate dispatching rule. Furthermore, we present Gymjsp, a public
benchmark based on the well-known OR-Library, to provide a standardized
off-the-shelf facility for RL and DJSP research communities. Comprehensive
experiments on various DJSP instances confirm that our proposed framework is
superior to baseline algorithms with smaller makespan across all instances and
provide empirical justification for the validity of the various components in
the hybrid framework.</span>

                    <span>There is a general trend of applying reinforcement learning (RL) techniques
for traffic signal control (TSC). Recently, most studies pay attention to the
neural network design and rarely concentrate on the state representation. Does
the design of state representation has a good impact on TSC? In this paper, we
(1) propose an effective state representation as queue length of vehicles with
intensive knowledge; (2) present a TSC method called MaxQueue based on our
state representation approach; (3) develop a general RL-based TSC template
called QL-XLight with queue length as state and reward and generate QL-FRAP,
QL-CoLight, and QL-DQN by our QL-XLight template based on traditional and
latest RL models.Through comprehensive experiments on multiple real-world
datasets, we demonstrate that: (1) our MaxQueue method outperforms the latest
RL based methods; (2) QL-FRAP and QL-CoLight achieves a new state-of-the-art
(SOTA). In general, state representation with intensive knowledge is also
essential for TSC methods. Our code is released on Github.</span>

                    <span>Outlier detection refers to the identification of data points that deviate
from a general data distribution. Existing unsupervised approaches often suffer
from high computational cost, complex hyperparameter tuning, and limited
interpretability, especially when working with large, high-dimensional
datasets. To address these issues, we present a simple yet effective algorithm
called ECOD (Empirical-Cumulative-distribution-based Outlier Detection), which
is inspired by the fact that outliers are often the &quot;rare events&quot; that appear
in the tails of a distribution. In a nutshell, ECOD first estimates the
underlying distribution of the input data in a nonparametric fashion by
computing the empirical cumulative distribution per dimension of the data. ECOD
then uses these empirical distributions to estimate tail probabilities per
dimension for each data point. Finally, ECOD computes an outlier score of each
data point by aggregating estimated tail probabilities across dimensions. Our
contributions are as follows: (1) we propose a novel outlier detection method
called ECOD, which is both parameter-free and easy to interpret; (2) we perform
extensive experiments on 30 benchmark datasets, where we find that ECOD
outperforms 11 state-of-the-art baselines in terms of accuracy, efficiency, and
scalability; and (3) we release an easy-to-use and scalable (with distributed
support) Python implementation for accessibility and reproducibility.</span>

                    <span>Bayesian optimization (BO) is a framework for global optimization of
expensive-to-evaluate objective functions. Classical BO methods assume that the
objective function is a black box. However, internal information about
objective function computation is often available. For example, when optimizing
a manufacturing line&#x27;s throughput with simulation, we observe the number of
parts waiting at each workstation, in addition to the overall throughput.
Recent BO methods leverage such internal information to dramatically improve
performance. We call these &quot;grey-box&quot; BO methods because they treat objective
computation as partially observable and even modifiable, blending the black-box
approach with so-called &quot;white-box&quot; first-principles knowledge of objective
function computation. This tutorial describes these methods, focusing on BO of
composite objective functions, where one can observe and selectively evaluate
individual constituents that feed into the overall objective; and
multi-fidelity BO, where one can evaluate cheaper approximations of the
objective function by varying parameters of the evaluation oracle.</span>

                    <span>Heat transfer characteristics of nanofluids have been extensively studied
since the 1990s. Research investigations show that the suspended nanoparticles
significantly alter the suspension&#x27;s thermal properties. The thermal
conductivity of nanofluids is one of the properties that is generally found to
be greater than that of the base fluid. This increase in thermal conductivity
is found to depend on several parameters. Several theories have been proposed
to model the thermal conductivities of nanofluids, but there is no reliable
universal theory yet to model the anomalous thermal conductivity of nanofluids.
In recent years, supervised data-driven methods have been successfully employed
to create surrogate models across various scientific disciplines, especially
for modeling difficult-to-understand phenomena. These supervised learning
methods allow the models to capture highly non-linear phenomena. In this work,
we have taken advantage of existing correlations and used them concurrently
with available experimental results to develop more robust surrogate models for
predicting the thermal conductivity of nanofluids. Artificial neural networks
are trained using the transfer learning approach to predict the thermal
conductivity enhancement of nanofluids with spherical particles for 32
different particle-fluid combinations (8 particles materials and 4 fluids). The
large amount of lower accuracy data generated from correlations is used to
coarse-tune the model parameters, and the limited amount of more trustworthy
experimental data is used to fine-tune the model parameters. The transfer
learning-based models&#x27; results are compared with those from baseline models
which are trained only on experimental data using a goodness of fit metric. It
is found that the transfer learning models perform better with goodness of fit
values of 0.93 as opposed to 0.83 from the baseline models.</span>

                    <span>Log anomaly detection is a key component in the field of artificial
intelligence for IT operations (AIOps). Considering log data of variant
domains, retraining the whole network for unknown domains is inefficient in
real industrial scenarios especially for low-resource domains. However,
previous deep models merely focused on extracting the semantics of log sequence
in the same domain, leading to poor generalization on multi-domain logs.
Therefore, we propose a unified Transformer-based framework for log anomaly
detection (\ourmethod{}), which is comprised of the pretraining and
adapter-based tuning stage. Our model is first pretrained on the source domain
to obtain shared semantic knowledge of log data. Then, we transfer the
pretrained model to the target domain via the adapter-based tuning. The
proposed method is evaluated on three public datasets including one source
domain and two target domains. The experimental results demonstrate that our
simple yet efficient approach, with fewer trainable parameters and lower
training costs in the target domain, achieves state-of-the-art performance on
three benchmarks.</span>

                    <span>Most semi-supervised learning methods over-sample labeled data when
constructing training mini-batches. This paper studies whether this common
practice improves learning and how. We compare it to an alternative setting
where each mini-batch is uniformly sampled from all the training data, labeled
or not, which greatly reduces direct supervision from true labels in typical
low-label regimes. However, this simpler setting can also be seen as more
general and even necessary in multi-task problems where over-sampling labeled
data would become intractable. Our experiments on semi-supervised CIFAR-10
image classification using FixMatch show a performance drop when using the
uniform sampling approach which diminishes when the amount of labeled data or
the training time increases. Further, we analyse the training dynamics to
understand how over-sampling of labeled data compares to uniform sampling. Our
main finding is that over-sampling is especially beneficial early in training
but gets less important in the later stages when more pseudo-labels become
correct. Nevertheless, we also find that keeping some true labels remains
important to avoid the accumulation of confirmation errors from incorrect
pseudo-labels.</span>

objective whose optima are exactly the set of all representations on which risk
minimizers are guaranteed to be robust to any distribution shift that preserves
the Bayes predictor, e.g., covariate shifts. Our objective has two components.
First, a representation must remain discriminative for the task, i.e., some
predictor must be able to simultaneously minimize the source and target risk.
Second, the representation&#x27;s marginal support needs to be the same across
source and target. We make this practical by designing self-supervised learning
methods that only use unlabelled data and augmentations to train robust

                    <span>Many existing region-of-attraction (ROA) analysis tools find difficulty in
addressing feedback systems with large-scale neural network (NN) policies
and/or high-dimensional sensing modalities such as cameras. In this paper, we
tailor the projected gradient descent (PGD) attack method developed in the
adversarial learning community as a general-purpose ROA analysis tool for
large-scale nonlinear systems and end-to-end perception-based control. We show
that the ROA analysis can be approximated as a constrained maximization problem
whose goal is to find the worst-case initial condition which shifts the
terminal state the most. Then we present two PGD-based iterative methods which
can be used to solve the resultant constrained maximization problem. Our
analysis is not based on Lyapunov theory, and hence requires minimum
information of the problem structures. In the model-based setting, we show that
the PGD updates can be efficiently performed using back-propagation. In the
model-free setting (which is more relevant to ROA analysis of perception-based
control), we propose a finite-difference PGD estimate which is general and only
requires a black-box simulator for generating the trajectories of the
closed-loop system given any initial state. We demonstrate the scalability and
generality of our analysis tool on several numerical examples with large-scale
NN policies and high-dimensional image observations. We believe that our
proposed analysis serves as a meaningful initial step toward further
understanding of closed-loop stability of large-scale nonlinear systems and
perception-based control.</span>

                    <span>We consider large-scale Markov decision processes (MDPs) with an unknown cost
function and employ stochastic convex optimization tools to address the problem
of imitation learning, which consists of learning a policy from a finite set of
expert demonstrations.

We adopt the apprenticeship learning formalism, which carries the assumption
that the true cost function can be represented as a linear combination of some
known features. Existing inverse reinforcement learning algorithms come with
strong theoretical guarantees, but are computationally expensive because they
use reinforcement learning or planning algorithms as a subroutine. On the other
hand, state-of-the-art policy gradient based algorithms (like IM-REINFORCE,
IM-TRPO, and GAIL), achieve significant empirical success in challenging
benchmark tasks, but are not well understood in terms of theory. With an
emphasis on non-asymptotic guarantees of performance, we propose a method that
directly learns a policy from expert demonstrations, bypassing the intermediate
step of learning the cost function, by formulating the problem as a single
convex optimization problem over occupancy measures. We develop a
computationally efficient algorithm and derive high confidence regret bounds on
the quality of the extracted policy, utilizing results from stochastic convex
optimization and recent works in approximate linear programming for solving
forward MDPs.</span>

                    <span>Learning operators between infinitely dimensional spaces is an important
learning task arising in wide applications in machine learning, imaging
science, mathematical modeling and simulations, etc. This paper studies the
nonparametric estimation of Lipschitz operators using deep neural networks.
Non-asymptotic upper bounds are derived for the generalization error of the
empirical risk minimizer over a properly chosen network class. Under the
assumption that the target operator exhibits a low dimensional structure, our
error bounds decay as the training sample size increases, with an attractive
fast rate depending on the intrinsic dimension in our estimation. Our
assumptions cover most scenarios in real applications and our results give rise
to fast rates by exploiting low dimensional structures of data in operator
estimation. We also investigate the influence of network structures (e.g.,
network width, depth, and sparsity) on the generalization error of the neural
network estimator and propose a general suggestion on the choice of network
structures to maximize the learning efficiency quantitatively.</span>

                    <span>The crafting of machine learning (ML) based systems requires statistical
control throughout its life cycle. Careful quantification of business
requirements and identification of key factors that impact the business
requirements reduces the risk of a project failure. The quantification of
business requirements results in the definition of random variables
representing the system key performance indicators that need to be analyzed
through statistical experiments. In addition, available data for training and
experiment results impact the design of the system. Once the system is
developed, it is tested and continually monitored to ensure it meets its
business requirements. This is done through the continued application of
statistical experiments to analyze and control the key performance indicators.
This book teaches the art of crafting and developing ML based systems. It
advocates an &quot;experiment first&quot; approach stressing the need to define
statistical experiments from the beginning of the project life cycle. It also
discusses in detail how to apply statistical control on the ML based system
throughout its lifecycle.</span>

                    <span>Emerging edge applications require both a fast response latency and complex
processing. This is infeasible without expensive hardware that can process
complex operations -- such as object detection -- within a short time. Many
approach this problem by addressing the complexity of the models -- via model
compression, pruning and quantization -- or compressing the input. In this
paper, we propose a different perspective when addressing the performance
challenges. Croesus is a multi-stage approach to edge-cloud systems that
provides the ability to find the balance between accuracy and performance.
Croesus consists of two stages (that can be generalized to multiple stages): an
initial and a final stage. The initial stage performs the computation in
real-time using approximate/best-effort computation at the edge. The final
stage performs the full computation at the cloud, and uses the results to
correct any errors made at the initial stage. In this paper, we demonstrate the
implications of such an approach on a video analytics use-case and show how
multi-stage processing yields a better balance between accuracy and
performance. Moreover, we study the safety of multi-stage transactions via two
proposals: multi-stage serializability (MS-SR) and multi-stage invariant
confluence with Apologies (MS-IA).</span>

                    <span>Significant work has been placed in the Q&amp;A NLP space to build models that
are more robust to adversarial attacks. Two key areas of focus are in
generating adversarial data for the purposes of training against these
situations or modifying existing architectures to build robustness within. This
paper introduces an approach that joins these two ideas together to train a
critic model for use in an almost reinforcement learning framework. Using the
Adversarial SQuAD &quot;Add One Sent&quot; dataset we show that there are some promising

                    <span>Diffusion Probabilistic models have been shown to generate state-of-the-art
results on several competitive image synthesis benchmarks but lack a
low-dimensional, interpretable latent space, and are slow at generation. On the
other hand, Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) typically have access to a
low-dimensional latent space but exhibit poor sample quality. Despite recent
advances, VAEs usually require high-dimensional hierarchies of the latent codes
to generate high-quality samples. We present DiffuseVAE, a novel generative
framework that integrates VAE within a diffusion model framework, and leverage
this to design a novel conditional parameterization for diffusion models. We
show that the resulting model can improve upon the unconditional diffusion
model in terms of sampling efficiency while also equipping diffusion models
with the low-dimensional VAE inferred latent code. Furthermore, we show that
the proposed model can generate high-resolution samples and exhibits synthesis
quality comparable to state-of-the-art models on standard benchmarks. Lastly,
we show that the proposed method can be used for controllable image synthesis
and also exhibits out-of-the-box capabilities for downstream tasks like image
super-resolution and denoising. For reproducibility, our source code is

                    <span>Dimensionality reduction methods have found vast application as visualization
tools in diverse areas of science. Although many different methods exist, their
performance is often insufficient for providing quick insight into many
contemporary datasets, and the unsupervised mode of use prevents the users from
utilizing the methods for dataset exploration and fine-tuning the details for
improved visualization quality. We present BlosSOM, a high-performance
semi-supervised dimensionality reduction software for interactive
user-steerable visualization of high-dimensional datasets with millions of
individual data points. BlosSOM builds on a GPU-accelerated implementation of
the EmbedSOM algorithm, complemented by several landmark-based algorithms for
interfacing the unsupervised model learning algorithms with the user
supervision. We show the application of BlosSOM on realistic datasets, where it
helps to produce high-quality visualizations that incorporate user-specified
layout and focus on certain features. We believe the semi-supervised
dimensionality reduction will improve the data visualization possibilities for
science areas such as single-cell cytometry, and provide a fast and efficient
base methodology for new directions in dataset exploration and annotation.</span>

                    <span>Running machine learning algorithms on large and rapidly growing volumes of
data is often computationally expensive, one common trick to reduce the size of
a data set, and thus reduce the computational cost of machine learning
algorithms, is \emph{probability sampling}. It creates a sampled data set by
including each data point from the original data set with a known probability.
Although the benefit of running machine learning algorithms on the reduced data
set is obvious, one major concern is that the performance of the solution
obtained from samples might be much worse than that of the optimal solution
when using the full data set. In this paper, we examine the performance loss
caused by probability sampling in the context of adaptive submodular
maximization. We consider a simple probability sampling method which selects
each data point with probability $r\in[0,1]$. If we set the sampling rate
$r&#x3D;1$, our problem reduces to finding a solution based on the original full
data set. We define sampling gap as the largest ratio between the optimal
solution obtained from the full data set and the optimal solution obtained from
the samples, over independence systems. %It captures the performance loss of
the optimal solution caused by the probability sampling. Our main contribution
is to show that if the utility function is policywise submodular, then for a
given sampling rate $r$, the sampling gap is both upper bounded and lower
bounded by $1/r$. One immediate implication of our result is that if we can
find an $\alpha$-approximation solution based on a sampled data set (which is
sampled at sampling rate $r$), then this solution achieves an $\alpha r$
approximation ratio against the optimal solution when using the full data set.</span>

                    <span>Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) is a fundamental structure in deep learning.
Recently, some works study the training process of over-parameterized neural
networks, and show that over-parameterized networks can learn functions in some
notable concept classes with a provable generalization error bound. In this
paper, we analyze the training and generalization for RNNs with random
initialization, and provide the following improvements over recent works:

1) For a RNN with input sequence $x&#x3D;(X_1,X_2,...,X_L)$, previous works study
to learn functions that are summation of $f(\beta^T_lX_l)$ and require
normalized conditions that $||X_l||\leq\epsilon$ with some very small
$\epsilon$ depending on the complexity of $f$. In this paper, using detailed
analysis about the neural tangent kernel matrix, we prove a generalization
error bound to learn such functions without normalized conditions and show that
some notable concept classes are learnable with the numbers of iterations and
samples scaling almost-polynomially in the input length $L$.

2) Moreover, we prove a novel result to learn N-variables functions of input
sequence with the form $f(\beta^T[X_{l_1},...,X_{l_N}])$, which do not belong
to the &quot;additive&quot; concept class, i,e., the summation of function $f(X_l)$. And
we show that when either $N$ or $l_0&#x3D;\max(l_1,..,l_N)-\min(l_1,..,l_N)$ is
small, $f(\beta^T[X_{l_1},...,X_{l_N}])$ will be learnable with the number
iterations and samples scaling almost-polynomially in the input length $L$.</span>

                    <span>Devising dynamic pricing policy with always valid online statistical learning
procedure is an important and as yet unresolved problem. Most existing dynamic
pricing policy, which focus on the faithfulness of adopted customer choice
models, exhibit a limited capability for adapting the online uncertainty of
learned statistical model during pricing process. In this paper, we propose a
novel approach for designing dynamic pricing policy based regularized online
statistical learning with theoretical guarantees. The new approach overcomes
the challenge of continuous monitoring of online Lasso procedure and possesses
several appealing properties. In particular, we make the decisive observation
that the always-validity of pricing decisions builds and thrives on the online
regularization scheme. Our proposed online regularization scheme equips the
proposed optimistic online regularized maximum likelihood pricing (OORMLP)
pricing policy with three major advantages: encode market noise knowledge into
pricing process optimism; empower online statistical learning with
always-validity over all decision points; envelop prediction error process with
time-uniform non-asymptotic oracle inequalities. This type of non-asymptotic
inference results allows us to design more sample-efficient and robust dynamic
pricing algorithms in practice. In theory, the proposed OORMLP algorithm
exploits the sparsity structure of high-dimensional models and secures a
logarithmic regret in a decision horizon. These theoretical advances are made
possible by proposing an optimistic online Lasso procedure that resolves
dynamic pricing problems at the process level, based on a novel use of
non-asymptotic martingale concentration. In experiments, we evaluate OORMLP in
different synthetic and real pricing problem settings, and demonstrate that
OORMLP advances the state-of-the-art methods.</span>

                    <span>In practical data analysis under noisy environment, it is common to first use
robust methods to identify outliers, and then to conduct further analysis after
removing the outliers. In this paper, we consider statistical inference of the
model estimated after outliers are removed, which can be interpreted as a
selective inference (SI) problem. To use conditional SI framework, it is
necessary to characterize the events of how the robust method identifies
outliers. Unfortunately, the existing methods cannot be directly used here
because they are applicable to the case where the selection events can be
represented by linear/quadratic constraints. In this paper, we propose a
conditional SI method for popular robust regressions by using homotopy method.
We show that the proposed conditional SI method is applicable to a wide class
of robust regression and outlier detection methods and has good empirical
performance on both synthetic data and real data experiments.</span>

algorithms to infer surface/ground exchange flux based on subsurface
temperature observations. The observations and fluxes are produced from a
high-resolution numerical model representing conditions in the Columbia River
near the Department of Energy Hanford site located in southeastern Washington
State. Random measurement error, of varying magnitude, is added to the
synthetic temperature observations. The results indicate that both ML and DL
methods can be used to infer the surface/ground exchange flux. DL methods,
especially convolutional neural networks, outperform the ML methods when used
to interpret noisy temperature data with a smoothing filter applied. However,
the ML methods also performed well and they are can better identify a reduced
number of important observations, which could be useful for measurement network
optimization. Surprisingly, the ML and DL methods better inferred upward flux
than downward flux. This is in direct contrast to previous findings using
numerical models to infer flux from temperature observations and it may suggest
that combined use of ML or DL inference with numerical inference could improve
flux estimation beneath river systems.</span>

                    <span>Meta-learning, or learning-to-learn, seeks to design algorithms that can
utilize previous experience to rapidly learn new skills or adapt to new
environments. Representation learning -- a key tool for performing
meta-learning -- learns a data representation that can transfer knowledge
across multiple tasks, which is essential in regimes where data is scarce.
Despite a recent surge of interest in the practice of meta-learning, the
theoretical underpinnings of meta-learning algorithms are lacking, especially
in the context of learning transferable representations. In this paper, we
focus on the problem of multi-task linear regression -- in which multiple
linear regression models share a common, low-dimensional linear representation.
Here, we provide provably fast, sample-efficient algorithms to address the dual
challenges of (1) learning a common set of features from multiple, related
tasks, and (2) transferring this knowledge to new, unseen tasks. Both are
central to the general problem of meta-learning. Finally, we complement these
results by providing information-theoretic lower bounds on the sample
complexity of learning these linear features.</span>

and large-scale data, we study the asymptotic behavior of kernel two-sample
tests when the dimension and sample sizes both diverge to infinity. We focus on
the maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) with the kernel of the form
$k(x,y)&#x3D;f(\|x-y\|_{2}^{2}/\gamma)$, including MMD with the Gaussian kernel and
the Laplacian kernel, and the energy distance as special cases. We derive
asymptotic expansions of the kernel two-sample statistics, based on which we
establish the central limit theorem (CLT) under both the null hypothesis and
the local and fixed alternatives. The new non-null CLT results allow us to
perform asymptotic exact power analysis, which reveals a delicate interplay
between the moment discrepancy that can be detected by the kernel two-sample
tests and the dimension-and-sample orders. The asymptotic theory is further
corroborated through numerical studies. Our findings complement those in the

                    <span>Probabilistic principal component analysis (PPCA) is a probabilistic
reformulation of principal component analysis (PCA), under the framework of a
Gaussian latent variable model. To improve the robustness of PPCA, it has been
proposed to change the underlying Gaussian distributions to multivariate
$t$-distributions. Based on the representation of $t$-distribution as a scale
mixture of Gaussian distributions, a hierarchical model is used for
implementation. However, in the existing literature, the hierarchical model
implemented does not yield the equivalent interpretation.

In this paper, we present two sets of equivalent relationships between the
high-level multivariate $t$-PPCA framework and the hierarchical model used for
implementation. In doing so, we clarify a current misrepresentation in the
literature, by specifying the correct correspondence. In addition, we discuss
the performance of different multivariate $t$ robust PPCA methods both in
theory and simulation studies, and propose a novel Monte Carlo
expectation-maximization (MCEM) algorithm to implement one general type of such
models.</span>

                    <span>Learning operators between infinitely dimensional spaces is an important
learning task arising in wide applications in machine learning, imaging
science, mathematical modeling and simulations, etc. This paper studies the
nonparametric estimation of Lipschitz operators using deep neural networks.
Non-asymptotic upper bounds are derived for the generalization error of the
empirical risk minimizer over a properly chosen network class. Under the
assumption that the target operator exhibits a low dimensional structure, our
error bounds decay as the training sample size increases, with an attractive
fast rate depending on the intrinsic dimension in our estimation. Our
assumptions cover most scenarios in real applications and our results give rise
to fast rates by exploiting low dimensional structures of data in operator
estimation. We also investigate the influence of network structures (e.g.,
network width, depth, and sparsity) on the generalization error of the neural
network estimator and propose a general suggestion on the choice of network
structures to maximize the learning efficiency quantitatively.</span>

                    <span>We analyze the optimized adaptive importance sampler (OAIS) for performing
Monte Carlo integration with general proposals. We leverage a classical result
which shows that the bias and the mean-squared error (MSE) of the importance
sampling scales with the $\chi^2$-divergence between the target and the
proposal and develop a scheme which performs global optimization of
$\chi^2$-divergence. While it is known that this quantity is convex for
exponential family proposals, the case of the general proposals has been an
open problem. We close this gap by utilizing stochastic gradient Langevin
dynamics (SGLD) and its underdamped counterpart for the global optimization of
$\chi^2$-divergence and derive nonasymptotic bounds for the MSE by leveraging
recent results from non-convex optimization literature. The resulting AIS

                    <span>Outlier detection refers to the identification of data points that deviate
from a general data distribution. Existing unsupervised approaches often suffer
from high computational cost, complex hyperparameter tuning, and limited
interpretability, especially when working with large, high-dimensional
datasets. To address these issues, we present a simple yet effective algorithm
called ECOD (Empirical-Cumulative-distribution-based Outlier Detection), which
is inspired by the fact that outliers are often the &quot;rare events&quot; that appear
in the tails of a distribution. In a nutshell, ECOD first estimates the
underlying distribution of the input data in a nonparametric fashion by
computing the empirical cumulative distribution per dimension of the data. ECOD
then uses these empirical distributions to estimate tail probabilities per
dimension for each data point. Finally, ECOD computes an outlier score of each
data point by aggregating estimated tail probabilities across dimensions. Our
contributions are as follows: (1) we propose a novel outlier detection method
called ECOD, which is both parameter-free and easy to interpret; (2) we perform
extensive experiments on 30 benchmark datasets, where we find that ECOD
outperforms 11 state-of-the-art baselines in terms of accuracy, efficiency, and
scalability; and (3) we release an easy-to-use and scalable (with distributed
support) Python implementation for accessibility and reproducibility.</span>

                    <span>Stability selection (Meinshausen and Buhlmann, 2010) makes any feature
selection method more stable by returning only those features that are
consistently selected across many subsamples. We prove (in what is, to our
knowledge, the first result of its kind) that for data containing highly
correlated proxies for an important latent variable, the lasso typically
selects one proxy, yet stability selection with the lasso can fail to select
any proxy, leading to worse predictive performance than the lasso alone.

We introduce cluster stability selection, which exploits the practitioner&#x27;s
knowledge that highly correlated clusters exist in the data, resulting in
better feature rankings than stability selection in this setting. We consider
several feature-combination approaches, including taking a weighted average of
the features in each important cluster where weights are determined by the
frequency with which cluster members are selected, which we show leads to
better predictive models than previous proposals.

We present generalizations of theoretical guarantees from Meinshausen and
Buhlmann (2010) and Shah and Samworth (2012) to show that cluster stability
selection retains the same guarantees. In summary, cluster stability selection
enjoys the best of both worlds, yielding a sparse selected set that is both
stable and has good predictive performance.</span>

over-parameterized so that they can fit the noisy training data exactly, yet
they can still achieve small test errors in practice. In this paper, we study
this &quot;benign overfitting&quot; phenomenon of the maximum margin classifier for
linear classification problems. Specifically, we consider data generated from
sub-Gaussian mixtures, and provide a tight risk bound for the maximum margin
linear classifier in the over-parameterized setting. Our results precisely
characterize the condition under which benign overfitting can occur in linear
classification problems, and improve on previous work. They also have direct
implications for over-parameterized logistic regression.</span>

                    <span>Classification of malware families is crucial for a comprehensive
understanding of how they can infect devices, computers, or systems. Thus,
malware identification enables security researchers and incident responders to
take precautions against malware and accelerate mitigation. API call sequences
made by malware are widely utilized features by machine and deep learning
models for malware classification as these sequences represent the behavior of
malware. However, traditional machine and deep learning models remain incapable
of capturing sequence relationships between API calls. On the other hand, the
transformer-based models process sequences as a whole and learn relationships
between API calls due to multi-head attention mechanisms and positional
embeddings. Our experiments demonstrate that the transformer model with one
transformer block layer surpassed the widely used base architecture, LSTM.
Moreover, BERT or CANINE, pre-trained transformer models, outperformed in
classifying highly imbalanced malware families according to evaluation metrics,
F1-score, and AUC score. Furthermore, the proposed bagging-based random
transformer forest (RTF), an ensemble of BERT or CANINE, has reached the
state-of-the-art evaluation scores on three out of four datasets, particularly
state-of-the-art F1-score of 0.6149 on one of the commonly used benchmark

                    <span>We aim to provably complete a sparse and highly-missing tensor in the
presence of covariate information along tensor modes. Our motivation comes from
online advertising where users click-through-rates (CTR) on ads over various
devices form a CTR tensor that has about 96% missing entries and has many zeros
on non-missing entries, which makes the standalone tensor completion method
unsatisfactory. Beside the CTR tensor, additional ad features or user
characteristics are often available. In this paper, we propose
Covariate-assisted Sparse Tensor Completion (COSTCO) to incorporate covariate
information for the recovery of the sparse tensor. The key idea is to jointly
extract latent components from both the tensor and the covariate matrix to
learn a synthetic representation. Theoretically, we derive the error bound for
the recovered tensor components and explicitly quantify the improvements on
both the reveal probability condition and the tensor recovery accuracy due to
covariates. Finally, we apply COSTCO to an advertisement dataset consisting of
a CTR tensor and ad covariate matrix, leading to 23% accuracy improvement over
the baseline. An important by-product is that ad latent components from COSTCO
reveal interesting ad clusters, which are useful for better ad targeting.</span>

                    <span>The Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture is showing promising results in
improving parameter sharing in multi-task learning (MTL) and in scaling
high-capacity neural networks. State-of-the-art MoE models use a trainable
sparse gate to select a subset of the experts for each input example. While
conceptually appealing, existing sparse gates, such as Top-k, are not smooth.
The lack of smoothness can lead to convergence and statistical performance
issues when training with gradient-based methods. In this paper, we develop
DSelect-k: a continuously differentiable and sparse gate for MoE, based on a
novel binary encoding formulation. The gate can be trained using first-order
methods, such as stochastic gradient descent, and offers explicit control over
the number of experts to select. We demonstrate the effectiveness of DSelect-k
on both synthetic and real MTL datasets with up to $128$ tasks. Our experiments
indicate that DSelect-k can achieve statistically significant improvements in
prediction and expert selection over popular MoE gates. Notably, on a
real-world, large-scale recommender system, DSelect-k achieves over $22\%$
improvement in predictive performance compared to Top-k. We provide an
open-source implementation of DSelect-k.</span>

                    <span>The staple of human intelligence is the capability of acquiring knowledge in
a continuous fashion. In stark contrast, Deep Networks forget catastrophically
and, for this reason, the sub-field of Class-Incremental Continual Learning
fosters methods that learn a sequence of tasks incrementally, blending
sequentially-gained knowledge into a comprehensive prediction.

This work aims at assessing and overcoming the pitfalls of our previous
proposal Dark Experience Replay (DER), a simple and effective approach that
combines rehearsal and Knowledge Distillation. Inspired by the way our minds
constantly rewrite past recollections and set expectations for the future, we
endow our model with the abilities to i) revise its replay memory to welcome
novel information regarding past data ii) pave the way for learning yet unseen
classes.

We show that the application of these strategies leads to remarkable
improvements; indeed, the resulting method - termed eXtended-DER (X-DER) -
outperforms the state of the art on both standard benchmarks (such as CIFAR-100
and miniImagenet) and a novel one here introduced. To gain a better
understanding, we further provide extensive ablation studies that corroborate
and extend the findings of our previous research (e.g. the value of Knowledge
Distillation and flatter minima in continual learning setups).</span>

                    <span>In the hospital setting, a small percentage of recurrent frequent patients
contribute to a disproportional amount of healthcare resource usage. Moreover,
in many of these cases, patient outcomes can be greatly improved by reducing
reoccurring visits, especially when they are associated with substance abuse,
mental health, and medical factors that could be improved by social-behavioral
interventions, outpatient or preventative care. Additionally, health care costs
can be reduced significantly with fewer preventable recurrent visits.

To address this, we developed a computationally efficient and interpretable
framework that both identifies recurrent patients with high utilization and
determines which comorbidities contribute most to their recurrent visits.
Specifically, we present a novel algorithm, called the minimum similarity
association rules (MSAR), balancing confidence-support trade-off, to determine
the conditions most associated with reoccurring Emergency department (ED) and
inpatient visits. We validate MSAR on a large Electric Health Record (EHR)

                    <span>Embedding methods for product spaces are powerful techniques for
low-distortion and low-dimensional representation of complex data structures.
Here, we address the new problem of linear classification in product space
forms -- products of Euclidean, spherical, and hyperbolic spaces. First, we
describe novel formulations for linear classifiers on a Riemannian manifold
using geodesics and Riemannian metrics which generalize straight lines and
inner products in vector spaces. Second, we prove that linear classifiers in
$d$-dimensional space forms of any curvature have the same expressive power,
i.e., they can shatter exactly $d+1$ points. Third, we formalize linear
classifiers in product space forms, describe the first known perceptron and
support vector machine classifiers for such spaces and establish rigorous
convergence results for perceptrons. Moreover, we prove that the
Vapnik-Chervonenkis dimension of linear classifiers in a product space form of
dimension $d$ is \emph{at least} $d+1$. We support our theoretical findings
with simulations on several datasets, including synthetic data, image data, and
single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data. The results show that
classification in low-dimensional product space forms for scRNA-seq data
offers, on average, a performance improvement of $\sim15\%$ when compared to
that in Euclidean spaces of the same dimension.</span>

                    <span>We study reinforcement learning (RL) with linear function approximation under
the adaptivity constraint. We consider two popular limited adaptivity models:
the batch learning model and the rare policy switch model, and propose two
efficient online RL algorithms for episodic linear Markov decision processes,
where the transition probability and the reward function can be represented as
a linear function of some known feature mapping. In specific, for the batch
learning model, our proposed LSVI-UCB-Batch algorithm achieves an $\tilde
O(\sqrt{d^3H^3T} + dHT/B)$ regret, where $d$ is the dimension of the feature
mapping, $H$ is the episode length, $T$ is the number of interactions and $B$
is the number of batches. Our result suggests that it suffices to use only
$\sqrt{T/dH}$ batches to obtain $\tilde O(\sqrt{d^3H^3T})$ regret. For the rare
policy switch model, our proposed LSVI-UCB-RareSwitch algorithm enjoys an
$\tilde O(\sqrt{d^3H^3T[1+T/(dH)]^{dH/B}})$ regret, which implies that $dH\log
T$ policy switches suffice to obtain the $\tilde O(\sqrt{d^3H^3T})$ regret. Our
algorithms achieve the same regret as the LSVI-UCB algorithm (Jin et al.,

a lower bound for the batch learning model, which suggests that the dependency
on $B$ in our regret bound is tight.</span>

                    <span>Recently, Zhang et al.(2021) developed a new neural network architecture
based on $\ell_\infty$-distance functions, which naturally possesses certified
$\ell_\infty$ robustness by its construction. Despite rigorous theoretical
guarantees, the model so far can only achieve comparable performance to
conventional networks. In this paper, we make the following two contributions:
$\mathrm{(i)}$ We demonstrate that $\ell_\infty$-distance nets enjoy a
fundamental advantage in certified robustness over conventional networks (under
typical certification approaches); $\mathrm{(ii)}$ With an improved training
process we are able to significantly boost the certified accuracy of
$\ell_\infty$-distance nets. Our training approach largely alleviates the
optimization problem that arose in the previous training scheme, in particular,
the unexpected large Lipschitz constant due to the use of a crucial trick
called $\ell_p$-relaxation. The core of our training approach is a novel
objective function that combines scaled cross-entropy loss and clipped hinge
loss with a decaying mixing coefficient. Experiments show that using the
proposed training strategy, the certified accuracy of $\ell_\infty$-distance
net can be dramatically improved from 33.30% to 40.06% on CIFAR-10
($\epsilon&#x3D;8/255$), meanwhile outperforming other approaches in this area by a
large margin. Our results clearly demonstrate the effectiveness and potential
of $\ell_\infty$-distance net for certified robustness. Codes are available at

                    <span>In this article, we aim to provide a general and complete understanding of
semi-supervised (SS) causal inference for treatment effects. Specifically, we
consider two such estimands: (a) the average treatment effect and (b) the
quantile treatment effect, as prototype cases, in an SS setting, characterized
by two available data sets: (i) a labeled data set of size $n$, providing
observations for a response and a set of high dimensional covariates, as well
as a binary treatment indicator; and (ii) an unlabeled data set of size $N$,
much larger than $n$, but without the response observed. Using these two data
sets, we develop a family of SS estimators which are ensured to be: (1) more
robust and (2) more efficient than their supervised counterparts based on the
labeled data set only. Beyond the &#x27;standard&#x27; double robustness results (in
terms of consistency) that can be achieved by supervised methods as well, we
further establish root-n consistency and asymptotic normality of our SS
estimators whenever the propensity score in the model is correctly specified,
without requiring specific forms of the nuisance functions involved. Such an
improvement of robustness arises from the use of the massive unlabeled data, so
it is generally not attainable in a purely supervised setting. In addition, our
estimators are shown to be semi-parametrically efficient as long as all the
nuisance functions are correctly specified. Moreover, as an illustration of the
nuisance estimators, we consider inverse-probability-weighting type kernel
smoothing estimators involving unknown covariate transformation mechanisms, and
establish in high dimensional scenarios novel results on their uniform
convergence rates, which should be of independent interest. Numerical results
on both simulated and real data validate the advantage of our methods over
their supervised counterparts with respect to both robustness and efficiency.</span>

                    <span>Machine learning models trained by different optimization algorithms under
different data distributions can exhibit distinct generalization behaviors. In
this paper, we analyze the generalization of models trained by noisy iterative
algorithms. We derive distribution-dependent generalization bounds by
connecting noisy iterative algorithms to additive noise channels found in
communication and information theory. Our generalization bounds shed light on
several applications, including differentially private stochastic gradient
descent (DP-SGD), federated learning, and stochastic gradient Langevin dynamics
(SGLD). We demonstrate our bounds through numerical experiments, showing that
they can help understand recent empirical observations of the generalization
phenomena of neural networks.</span>

                    <span>We analyze the best achievable performance of Bayesian learning under
generative models by defining and upper-bounding the minimum excess risk (MER):
the gap between the minimum expected loss attainable by learning from data and
the minimum expected loss that could be achieved if the model realization were
known. The definition of MER provides a principled way to define different
notions of uncertainties in Bayesian learning, including the aleatoric
uncertainty and the minimum epistemic uncertainty. Two methods for deriving
upper bounds for the MER are presented. The first method, generally suitable
for Bayesian learning with a parametric generative model, upper-bounds the MER
by the conditional mutual information between the model parameters and the
quantity being predicted given the observed data. It allows us to quantify the
rate at which the MER decays to zero as more data becomes available. Under
realizable models, this method also relates the MER to the richness of the
generative function class, notably the VC dimension in binary classification.
The second method, particularly suitable for Bayesian learning with a
parametric predictive model, relates the MER to the minimum estimation error of
the model parameters from data. It explicitly shows how the uncertainty in
model parameter estimation translates to the MER and to the final prediction
uncertainty. We also extend the definition and analysis of MER to the setting
with multiple model families and the setting with nonparametric models. Along
the discussions we draw some comparisons between the MER in Bayesian learning
and the excess risk in frequentist learning.</span>

Processes (MDPs) under the tabular setting. We propose a model-based algorithm
named UCBVI-$\gamma$, which is based on the \emph{optimism in the face of
uncertainty principle} and the Bernstein-type bonus. We show that
UCBVI-$\gamma$ achieves an $\tilde{O}\big({\sqrt{SAT}}/{(1-\gamma)^{1.5}}\big)$
regret, where $S$ is the number of states, $A$ is the number of actions,
$\gamma$ is the discount factor and $T$ is the number of steps. In addition, we
construct a class of hard MDPs and show that for any algorithm, the expected
regret is at least $\tilde{\Omega}\big({\sqrt{SAT}}/{(1-\gamma)^{1.5}}\big)$.
Our upper bound matches the minimax lower bound up to logarithmic factors,
which suggests that UCBVI-$\gamma$ is nearly minimax optimal for discounted

                    <span>Among the most successful methods for sparsifying deep (neural) networks are
those that adaptively mask the network weights throughout training. By
examining this masking, or dropout, in the linear case, we uncover a duality
between such adaptive methods and regularization through the so-called
&quot;$\eta$-trick&quot; that casts both as iteratively reweighted optimizations. We show
that any dropout strategy that adapts to the weights in a monotonic way
corresponds to an effective subquadratic regularization penalty, and therefore
leads to sparse solutions. We obtain the effective penalties for several
popular sparsification strategies, which are remarkably similar to classical
penalties commonly used in sparse optimization. Considering variational dropout
as a case study, we demonstrate similar empirical behavior between the adaptive
dropout method and classical methods on the task of deep network
sparsification, validating our theory.</span>

                    <span>The idea of slicing divergences has been proven to be successful when
comparing two probability measures in various machine learning applications
including generative modeling, and consists in computing the expected value of
a &#x60;base divergence&#x27; between one-dimensional random projections of the two
measures. However, the topological, statistical, and computational consequences
of this technique have not yet been well-established. In this paper, we aim at
bridging this gap and derive various theoretical properties of sliced
probability divergences. First, we show that slicing preserves the metric
axioms and the weak continuity of the divergence, implying that the sliced
divergence will share similar topological properties. We then precise the
results in the case where the base divergence belongs to the class of integral
probability metrics. On the other hand, we establish that, under mild
conditions, the sample complexity of a sliced divergence does not depend on the
problem dimension. We finally apply our general results to several base
divergences, and illustrate our theory on both synthetic and real data
experiments.</span>

                    <span>As machine learning powered decision making is playing an increasingly
important role in our daily lives, it is imperative to strive for fairness of
the underlying data processing and algorithms. We propose a pre-processing
algorithm for fair data representation via which L2- objective supervised
learning algorithms result in an estimation of the Pareto frontier between
prediction error and statistical disparity. In particular, the present work
applies the optimal positive definite affine transport maps to approach the
post-processing Wasserstein barycenter characterization of the optimal fair
L2-objective supervised learning via a pre-processing data deformation. We call
the resulting data Wasserstein pseudo-barycenter. Furthermore, we show that the
Wasserstein geodesics from the learning outcome marginals to the barycenter
characterizes the Pareto frontier between L2-loss and total Wasserstein
distance among learning outcome marginals. Thereby, an application of McCann
interpolation generalizes the pseudo-barycenter to a family of data
representations via which L2-objective supervised learning algorithms result in
the Pareto frontier. Numerical simulations underscore the advantages of the
proposed data representation: (1) the pre-processing step is compositive with
arbitrary L2-objective supervised learning methods and unseen data; (2) the
fair representation protects data privacy by preventing the training machine
from direct or indirect access to the sensitive information of the data; (3)
the optimal affine map results in efficient computation of fair supervised
learning on high-dimensional data; (4) experimental results shed light on the
fairness of L2-objective unsupervised learning via the proposed fair data
representation.</span>

                    <span>Spectral embedding of network adjacency matrices often produces node
representations living approximately around low-dimensional submanifold
structures. In particular, hidden substructure is expected to arise when the
graph is generated from a latent position model. Furthermore, the presence of
communities within the network might generate community-specific submanifold
structures in the embedding, but this is not explicitly accounted for in most
statistical models for networks. In this article, a class of models called
latent structure block models (LSBM) is proposed to address such scenarios,
allowing for graph clustering when community-specific one dimensional manifold
structure is present. LSBMs focus on a specific class of latent space model,
the random dot product graph (RDPG), and assign a latent submanifold to the
latent positions of each community. A Bayesian model for the embeddings arising
from LSBMs is discussed, and shown to have a good performance on simulated and
real world network data. The model is able to correctly recover the underlying
communities living in a one-dimensional manifold, even when the parametric form
of the underlying curves is unknown, achieving remarkable results on a variety
of real data.</span>

the numerical solution of optimization problems that involve the minimization
of a cost function that consists of the sum of many individual components. The
proposed scheme is a stochastic zeroth order optimization algorithm which
demands only the capability to evaluate small subsets of components of the cost
function. It can be depicted as a bank of samplers that generate particle
approximations of several sequences of probability measures. These measures are
constructed in such a way that they have associated probability density
functions whose global maxima coincide with the global minima of the original
cost function. The algorithm selects the best performing sampler and uses it to
approximate a global minimum of the cost function. We prove analytically that
the resulting estimator converges to a global minimum of the cost function
almost surely and provide explicit convergence rates in terms of the number of
generated Monte Carlo samples and the dimension of the search space. We show,
by way of numerical examples, that the algorithm can tackle cost functions with
multiple minima or with broad &quot;flat&quot; regions which are hard to minimize using
gradient-based techniques.</span>

                    <span>This paper is concerned with the training of neural networks (NNs) under
semidefinite constraints. This type of training problems has recently gained
popularity since semidefinite constraints can be used to verify interesting
properties for NNs that include, e.g., the estimation of an upper bound on the
Lipschitz constant, which relates to the robustness of an NN, or the stability
of dynamic systems with NN controllers. The utilized semidefinite constraints
are based on sector constraints satisfied by the underlying activation
functions. Unfortunately, one of the biggest bottlenecks of these new results
is the required computational effort for incorporating the semidefinite
constraints into the training of NNs which is limiting their scalability to
large NNs. We address this challenge by developing interior point methods for
NN training that we implement using barrier functions for semidefinite
constraints. In order to efficiently compute the gradients of the barrier
terms, we exploit the structure of the semidefinite constraints. In
experiments, we demonstrate the superior efficiency of our training method over
previous approaches, which allows us, e.g., to use semidefinite constraints in
the training of Wasserstein generative adversarial networks, where the
discriminator must satisfy a Lipschitz condition.</span>

invasive breast cancer. The mitotic cell count is one of the most common tests
to assess the aggressiveness or grade of breast cancer. In this prognosis,
histopathology images must be examined by a pathologist using high-resolution
microscopes to count the cells. Unfortunately, can be an exhaustive task with
poor reproducibility, especially for non-experts. Deep learning networks have
recently been adapted to medical applications which are able to automatically
localize these regions of interest. However, these region-based networks lack
the ability to take advantage of the segmentation features produced by a full
image CNN which are often used as a sole method of detection. Therefore, the
proposed method leverages Faster RCNN for object detection while fusing
segmentation features generated by a UNet with RGB image features to achieve an

                    <span>The actor-critic RL is widely used in various robotic control tasks. By
viewing the actor-critic RL from the perspective of variational inference (VI),
the policy network is trained to obtain the approximate posterior of actions
given the optimality criteria. However, in practice, the actor-critic RL may
yield suboptimal policy estimates due to the amortization gap and insufficient
exploration. In this work, inspired by the previous use of Hamiltonian Monte
Carlo (HMC) in VI, we propose to integrate the policy network of actor-critic
RL with HMC, which is termed as {\it Hamiltonian Policy}. As such we propose to
evolve actions from the base policy according to HMC, and our proposed method
has many benefits. First, HMC can improve the policy distribution to better
approximate the posterior and hence reduce the amortization gap. Second, HMC
can also guide the exploration more to the regions of action spaces with higher
Q values, enhancing the exploration efficiency. Further, instead of directly
applying HMC into RL, we propose a new leapfrog operator to simulate the
Hamiltonian dynamics. Finally, in safe RL problems, we find that the proposed
method can not only improve the achieved return, but also reduce safety
constraint violations by discarding potentially unsafe actions. With
comprehensive empirical experiments on continuous control baselines, including
MuJoCo and PyBullet Roboschool, we show that the proposed approach is a
data-efficient and easy-to-implement improvement over previous actor-critic
methods.</span>

                    <span>Latent Gaussian models and boosting are widely used techniques in statistics
and machine learning. Tree-boosting shows excellent prediction accuracy on many
data sets, but potential drawbacks are that it assumes conditional independence
of samples, produces discontinuous predictions for, e.g., spatial data, and it
can have difficulty with high-cardinality categorical variables. Latent
Gaussian models, such as Gaussian process and grouped random effects models,
are flexible prior models which explicitly model dependence among samples and
which allow for efficient learning of predictor functions and for making
probabilistic predictions. However, existing latent Gaussian models usually
assume either a zero or a linear prior mean function which can be an
unrealistic assumption. This article introduces a novel approach that combines
boosting and latent Gaussian models to remedy the above-mentioned drawbacks and
to leverage the advantages of both techniques. We obtain increased prediction
accuracy compared to existing approaches in both simulated and real-world data
experiments.</span>

                    <span>Bayesian optimization (BO) is a framework for global optimization of
expensive-to-evaluate objective functions. Classical BO methods assume that the
objective function is a black box. However, internal information about
objective function computation is often available. For example, when optimizing
a manufacturing line&#x27;s throughput with simulation, we observe the number of
parts waiting at each workstation, in addition to the overall throughput.
Recent BO methods leverage such internal information to dramatically improve
performance. We call these &quot;grey-box&quot; BO methods because they treat objective
computation as partially observable and even modifiable, blending the black-box
approach with so-called &quot;white-box&quot; first-principles knowledge of objective
function computation. This tutorial describes these methods, focusing on BO of
composite objective functions, where one can observe and selectively evaluate
individual constituents that feed into the overall objective; and
multi-fidelity BO, where one can evaluate cheaper approximations of the
objective function by varying parameters of the evaluation oracle.</span>

                    <span>Large-scale or high-resolution geologic models usually comprise a huge number
of grid blocks, which can be computationally demanding and time-consuming to
solve with numerical simulators. Therefore, it is advantageous to upscale
geologic models (e.g., hydraulic conductivity) from fine-scale (high-resolution
grids) to coarse-scale systems. Numerical upscaling methods have been proven to
be effective and robust for coarsening geologic models, but their efficiency
remains to be improved. In this work, a deep-learning-based method is proposed
to upscale the fine-scale geologic models, which can assist to improve
upscaling efficiency significantly. In the deep learning method, a deep
convolutional neural network (CNN) is trained to approximate the relationship
between the coarse grid of hydraulic conductivity fields and the hydraulic
heads, which can then be utilized to replace the numerical solvers while
solving the flow equations for each coarse block. In addition, physical laws
(e.g., governing equations and periodic boundary conditions) can also be
incorporated into the training process of the deep CNN model, which is termed
the theory-guided convolutional neural network (TgCNN). With the physical
information considered, dependence on the data volume of training the deep
learning models can be reduced greatly. Several subsurface flow cases are
introduced to test the performance of the proposed deep-learning-based
upscaling method, including 2D and 3D cases, and isotropic and anisotropic
cases. The results show that the deep learning method can provide equivalent
upscaling accuracy to the numerical method, and efficiency can be improved
significantly compared to numerical upscaling.</span>

                    <span>Reinforcement learning (RL) has drawn increasing interests in recent years
due to its tremendous success in various applications. However, standard RL
algorithms can only be applied for single reward function, and cannot adapt to
an unseen reward function quickly. In this paper, we advocate a general
operator view of reinforcement learning, which enables us to directly
approximate the operator that maps from reward function to value function. The
benefit of learning the operator is that we can incorporate any new reward
function as input and attain its corresponding value function in a zero-shot
manner. To approximate this special type of operator, we design a number of
novel operator neural network architectures based on its theoretical
properties. Our design of operator networks outperform the existing methods and
the standard design of general purpose operator network, and we demonstrate the
benefit of our operator deep Q-learning framework in several tasks including
reward transferring for offline policy evaluation (OPE) and reward transferring
for offline policy optimization in a range of tasks.</span>

                    <span>The transport of traffic flow can be modeled by the advection equation.
Finite difference and finite volumes methods have been used to numerically
solve this hyperbolic equation on a mesh. Advection has also been modeled
discretely on directed graphs using the graph advection operator [4, 18]. In
this paper, we first show that we can reformulate this graph advection operator
as a finite difference scheme. We then propose the Directed Graph Advection
Mat\&#x27;ern Gaussian Process (DGAMGP) model that incorporates the dynamics of this
graph advection operator into the kernel of a trainable Mat\&#x27;ern Gaussian
Process to effectively model traffic flow and its uncertainty as an advective
process on a directed graph.</span>

                    <span>Machine learning systems often experience a distribution shift between
training and testing. In this paper, we introduce a simple variational
objective whose optima are exactly the set of all representations on which risk
minimizers are guaranteed to be robust to any distribution shift that preserves
the Bayes predictor, e.g., covariate shifts. Our objective has two components.
First, a representation must remain discriminative for the task, i.e., some
predictor must be able to simultaneously minimize the source and target risk.
Second, the representation&#x27;s marginal support needs to be the same across
source and target. We make this practical by designing self-supervised learning
methods that only use unlabelled data and augmentations to train robust
representations. Our objectives achieve state-of-the-art results on DomainBed,
and give insights into the robustness of recent methods, such as CLIP.</span>

                    <span>Hi all! I&#x27;m working on a paper about measuring algorithmic fairness in cases where you don&#x27;t have direct access to demographic data (for example, if you want to see whether a lender is discriminating against a particular race but the lender is not collecting/releasing race data of loan applicants).
 If you have ~10 minutes and work in the ethical AI space, it would be a great help to hear from this community on whether/how often you have faced this issue in practice and what you think should be done to mitigate.

                    <span>It seems like most people associate sentient AI with Artificial General Intelligence, or AGI, but why should they be related? Wikipedia defines sentience as the &quot;ability to be aware of feelings and sensations&quot;, and this doesn&#x27;t seem to require any specific level of intelligence, does it? Couldn&#x27;t we build a sentient AI bot, for example, out of &quot;dumb&quot; neural networks (e.g. relatively small transformers and/or CNN/RNN models), so long as they connect together in a way that involves sensing a world around them (in whatever dimensions that world has, not necessarily the same as ours), using these sensations to construct some sort of internal &quot;state&quot;, and identifying that state accurately enough to drive subsequent action--or interaction with the world?

                    <span>Hi,
 Last year I developed a passenger flow forecasting model. Passenger flows are heavily influenced by lockdown measures and the weather, so I wanted to incorporate features relating to that into my model. Doing so, I encountered various frustrations:
 ​
  
Data providers generally focus on a specific domain (e.g. covid, weather, ecommerce). Forecasts however can be influenced by data from many domains. Finding these providers, signing up, and reading documentation is very time consuming.
 It takes a lot of code just to get the data you want. For example, to get covid data for my province, I first had to call a /list endpoint, then retrieve the province identifier, and then loop over the data endpoint because the maximum range was 2 months. I think the core problem is that API’s (as the …</span>

                    <span>I just stumbled on this very nice paper [a], which will appear in AAAI-22. 
 The title seems much too modest, they show that a random algorithm can achieve apparent SOTA results in this domain. This seems to be a stunning result, that casts doubt on the contribution of dozens of papers. 
 For some reason, the area of Time Series Anomaly Detection seems to be the wild west of dubious papers and sloppy thinking. 
 As an aside, there is a benchmark set of 250 datasets here [b] that can be evaluated in a way that is free of the flaw.
 (my post title reflects my understanding of the paper, the authors may have a different preferred claim).

                    <span>Hello!
 I hope you´re doing well.
 I am working on a multi-agent system with MADDPG.At time t when an agent asks for a task, the other agents are busy (i.e., the busy agents are those that are still processing a task, they didn´t finish it yet).So with this configuration, in the learning phase, I don´t know how to mask the state of the busy agents when injecting the state and action pair to the critic network.
 Thank you.

                    <span>I am a PhD student based in Canada and have a comprehensive exam coming up in 4-6 months. This is an exam I have been nervous about since I began my PhD. I am fairly confident about the actual proposal and answering questions related to my field. What concerns me more is fundamental/background question as ML and statistics is so broad. Plus, I am a little on the older side and my memory is a little poor.
 Have any students here taken a comprehensive exam? If so, what was your experience and how did you prepare? Is reading/making notes from a textbook a good idea? Or is preparing a list of topics and reading extensively about them a better option?

                    <span>I have a mxn matrix, m observations and n variables. Along with that, I have another dataset which are the features of the variables, a nxp matrix.
 What could be a way to get an mxp matrix (without naive matrix multiplication)? I wish to relate the observations to the features of variable.

                    <span>Hi all,
 This is my first conference season, so I am curious about how do author of full papers (not extended abstracts or student-track, not invited speeches) present in conferences like ICML, AAAI and IJCAI?
 I mean, for instance: are presentations performed in a panel with 3-5 presenters using slides, or are they all presented as posters where authors stay available for a duration of time for the interested readers to show up and discuss? Or something else?

Abstract The leading approaches in language modeling are all obsessed with TV shows of my youth - namely Transformers and Sesame Street. Transformers this, Transformers that, and over here a bonfire worth of GPU-TPU-neuromorphic wafer scale sil- icon. We opt for the lazy path of old and proven techniques with a fancy crypto1 inspired acronym: the Single Headed Attention RNN (SHA-RNN). The author’s lone goal is to show that the entire field might have evolved a different direction if we had instead been obsessed with a slightly differ- ent acronym and slightly different result. We take a previously strong language model based only on boring LSTMs and get it to within a stone’s throw of a stone’s throw of state-of-the-art byte level language model results on enwik8. This work has undergone no intensive hyperparameter optimization and lived entirely on a commodity desktop machine that made the author’s small stu- dio apartment far too warm in the midst of a San Franciscan summer2 . The final results are achiev- able in plus or minus 24 hours on a single GPU as the author is impatient. The attention mechanism is also readily extended to large contexts with minimal computation. Take that Sesame Street.

                    <span>I need to learn a map from Gaussain distribution to Gamma distribution with some custom parameters. So for both distributions, I can sample and evaluate probability density. The first thing, that came to my mind is using normalizing flow. 
 Most approaches include log target probability density evaluation in the loss function. Obviously, normalizing flow sometimes returns negative values, and this term equals to infinity. &quot;Positivation&quot; functions on top of the NF break bijection properties for some regions of space (if not theoretically, but numerically - defenetely). 
 Does NF approach is inapplicable from the box for such a simple problem or I&#x27;m missing something?

 I am now looking into Least Squares GAN but was wondering if it is a good idea to pretrain the discriminator of a Least Squares GAN since LSGANs address the problem of vanishing gradients and loss saturation?

 I have a smallish ~100MB corpus (of historical text in a non-mainstream language), on which I want to apply word embedding.
 - Is that enough? Shall I only consider &quot;frequent&quot; words? How frequent? does it help if I do some preprocessing such as stemming etc...?
 - How do I choose the parameters, especially the embedding dimensionality?
 - Any libraries recommended?
 - Are there some language-agnostic, unsupervised ways to evaluate the embeddings?
 ​
 Thanks

 Some possible examples: - The way how autodiff works - Debugging features - Working with axes, einops - Something that just feel awkward, inconvenient or incomplete
 I would very much appreciate it if you could share your thoughts on this.

                    <span>I&#x27;ve done a fair bit of work with RNNs and Time series data, but I now realize there may be a fundamental gap in my knowledge. I was reading through this and it raised some questions about the different kinds of time forecasting problems. 
 So, this is my summary of how it all works. Please correct me if I’m wrong. 
 Scenario 1: You want to predict the value of some stocks into the future. Let’s say you have k stocks and n days of data. You don’t have features/labels stocks, rather the input is each stocks’ current and previous values, and the output is each stocks’ future values. 
 Your two main options are the ‘auto-regressive’ approach where you predict the values one step at a time and feed them back in, or ‘single shot’ approach where you predict all values a fixed amount of time step…</span>

When I train a random forest classifier, I see that my model is only predicting the dominant class for all test instances most of the time. How can I get around to this? Also, are there any recommendations you can give me for dealing with imbalanced datasets? Thank you

                    <span>I am planning to train TD3/DDPG using a simulation environment, and then continue the learning on to a real-life environment. I hope to reduce the timestep required to converge in real-life environment as it is costly and time-consuming.
 I am new to RL and I am curious as to: &#x27;Would the algorithm still be flexible enough to continue learning?&#x27;
 I am slightly afraid about how the algorithm is going to think that it finished learning during the simulation environment, but then when it comes to real-life environment, it would not be flexible enough to learn on top of what it has already learned.
 Is this a trivial concern and is something that I should just let the algorithm learn by itself

                    <span>Hello,
 I hope you are doing well.
 I am working on DRL and there´re still some unclear points for me:
 - How we tune the hyperparameters of the network (is there a method to simplify the task)
 - How to know that we formulated the best state for the agent? 
 - In the case of collaborative multi-agent system, when an agent selects a task and the other agents are busy, will the reward be 0 for the busy agents or will be the reward of the agent that selects the task?

                    <span>I used yolov5 for object recognition and it does a fair job, but it also sees my hand as a bird in a lot of situations and leaves a lot to be desired. I know if they&#x27;re driving off of similar computer vision models, there&#x27;s gotta be a better one out there for detecting objects.
 PS I&#x27;ve been using pytorch for this so if you find a good model please also drop a link on how to get it up and running if you have it.

                    <span>Geometry Dash features an hourglass timer with three sections in the shape of circles and triangles. The timer starts in the upper left corner of the in-game map and ends when it falls into the lower right corner, allowing players to use up their time. When it falls to the bottom center of the map, a demon car appears and must be navigated. The demon is a curved ramp for the player&#x27;s icon, and every time the player&#x27;s icon touches a portion of the demon, its ramp is altered. Also, the demon&#x27;s top speed increases by 7x every time the player touches the bottom center. If the player touches the edge of the demon, then the demon will fall, taking a 5x amount of coins from the player&#x27;s meter. At the end of the level, the demon car drops into a pit.[5]

                    <span>In recent years, neural machine translation (NMT) has attracted a lot of attention and has had a lot of success. While traditional NMT is capable of translating a single language pair, training a separate model for each language pair is time-consuming, especially given the world’s thousands of languages. As a result, multilingual NMT is designed to handle many language pairs in a single model, lowering the cost of offline training and online deployment significantly. Furthermore, parameter sharing in multilingual neural machine translation promotes positive knowledge transfer between languages and is advantageous for low-resource translation.
 Despite the advantages of cooperative training with a completely shared model, the MNMT approach has a model capacity problem. The shared parameters are more likely to preserve broad knowledge while ignoring language-specific knowledge. To improve the model capacity, researchers use heuristic design to create extra language-specific components and build a Multilingual neural machine translation (MNMT) model with a mix of shared and language-specific characteristics, such as the language-specific attention, lightweight language adaptor, or language-specific routing layer.

                    <span>tl;dr: train PyTorch models on large tabular datasets with a scikit-learn (skorch) API
 Hi r/MachineLearning,
 I&#x27;m the principal author of ray-skorch, a library that lets you run distributed PyTorch training on large-scale datasets while providing a familiar, scikit-learn compatible skorch API, integrating well with the rest of the scikit-learn ecosystem.
 Under the hood, ray-skorch uses Ray Train for distributed PyTorch training and Ray Data for handling and shuffling large datasets.
 ray-skorch works only with tabular data. Currently, it can use numpy arrays, pandas dataframes and Ray Data Datasets.
 pip install ray-skorch
 You can switch your skorch code to ray-skorch just by changing a few lines:
 import numpy as np from sklearn.datasets import make_classification from torch import nn # pip install pytorch_tabnet from pytorch_tabnet.tab_network import TabNet from ray_skorch import RayTrainNeuralNet X, y &#x3D; make_classification(1000, 20, n_informative&#x3D;10, random_state&#x3D;0) X &#x3D; X.astype(np.float32) y &#x3D; y.astype(np.int64) net &#x3D; RayTrainNeuralNet( TabNet, num_workers&#x3D;2, # the only new mandatory argument criterion&#x3D;nn.CrossEntropyLoss, max_epochs&#x3D;10, lr&#x3D;0.1, # TabNet specific arguments module__input_dim&#x3D;20, module__output_dim&#x3D;2, # required for classification loss funcs iterator_train__unsqueeze_label_tensor&#x3D;False, iterator_valid__unsqueeze_label_tensor&#x3D;False, ) net.fit(X, y) # predict_proba returns a ray.data.Dataset y_proba &#x3D; net.predict_proba(X).to_pandas() 
 More examples, including ones on bigger datasets, can be found here - https://github.com/Yard1/ray-skorch/tree/main/examples
 The package is experimental, and I’d love to hear your feedback - both on the package itself and on the concept of distributed training on tabular data with simple, familiar APIs. Any comments, suggestions or bug reports are hugely appreciated!

                    <span>Hey everybody --- I know this isn&#x27;t hard core AI research but I have been thinking a lot about deep learning and gaming recently and put together a little presentation on how I see things unfolding. Lots of cool research featured in the video.
 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;JDL8rZzYVwQ
 I go over:
  
Photorealistic neural rendering
 Deepfakes for gaming (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;RR7u11ANDWE is a better example than the obama one I used)
 GAN theft auto and dreaming up game engines with neural networks
 Large language models for building realistic NPCs and storytelling
 Using OpenAI Codex to automatically program games.
  
It&#x27;s really clear that deep learning is the most important technology to impact gaming since the advent of 3D graphics. Would love to talk with anybody who is working on stuff in this space.

                    <span>Hi everyone, I&#x27;m looking for a model which can perform style transfer, but also takes an auxiliary noise vector similar to that for StyleGAN to generate many stylized images for a single input image. Is anyone aware of any model meeting these requirements? My best idea so far is to first embed the image into the StyleGAN latent space with this paper, and then add noise to that vector.

                    <span>Special machine learning street talk episode! Yann LeCun thinks that it&#x27;s specious to say neural network models are interpolating because in high dimensions, everything is extrapolation. Recently Dr. Randall Balestriero, Dr. Jerome Pesente and prof. Yann LeCun released their paper learning in high dimensions always amounts to extrapolation. This discussion has completely changed how we think about neural networks and their behaviour. 
 In the intro we talk about the spline theory of NNs, interpolation in NNs and the curse of dimensionality.

                    <span>I have a (personal) ML project that uses CNNs but I have two little problems: 1. not everyone has a NVidia GPU at home (myself included, sadly); 2. The CNN needs to be trained every time it is used (it&#x27;s photo to photo style transfer).
 So, what would be a good framework to implement the CNN for training (targeting desktop only)? I thought about using OpenGL, but I don&#x27;t know if using GLSL shaders would be a good fit for it.

We help ML practitioners create a central repository for their projects, where they can leverage open-source tools to version datasets and models, track experiments, and starting today – label data, and comment on anything. Like GitHub for machine learning (you probably heard that before, but we mean it).
 Our vision is that anyone could jump into an open-source data science project and contribute code, data, labeling,…</span>

                    <span>Hi All,
 I was just reading this paper and was wondering if we just want to achieve a compact version of the original representation we could just use a traditional AutoEncoder. Is there any specific reason the VAE is used?
 Thanks!

                    <span>Hi everybody,
 i&#x27;m a PhD student interested in audio spoofs (voice recordings faked with the help of AI), and have developed an online game: You play against an artificial intelligence and try to distinguish spoofed from real audio recordings.
 It&#x27;s fun, and very much supports my research. All partificpation (i.e. playing the game), comments or suggestions are welcome!

                    <span>Hey everyone! I’m one of the creators of Sieve, and I’m excited to be sharing it!
 Sieve is an API that helps you store, process, and automatically search your video data–instantly and efficiently. Just think 10 cameras recording footage at 30 FPS, 24/7. That would be 27 million frames generated in a single day. The videos might be searchable by timestamp, but finding moments of interest is like searching for a needle in a haystack.
 We built this visual demo (link here) a little while back which we’d love to get feedback on. It’s ~24 hours of security footage that our API processed in &lt;10 mins and has simple querying and export functionality enabled. We see applications in better understanding what data you have, figuring out which data to send to labeling, sampling datasets for training, and building multiple test sets for models by scenario.

                    <span>Hi, I have just published my latest medium article. It is a summary of a scientific paper that aims to eliminate the effect of locality which is one of the limitations of CNNs. In this attempt, researchers tried to reform the image semantic segmentation problem then operate a proposed transformer, and finally, introduce three different decoder architectures.
 Please read it and give me your feedback. If you find it interesting, you can share it with others who are interested in ML as well. Also, if you find it helpful, you can follow me on medium to be updated on my forthcoming articles.🙂

In cooperative games, all the agents have a team reward and have different states whereas in stochastic games, all the agents receives individual reward and they have the same state in a particular time step. Can someone help me understand the difference between these two games?

                    <span>Hi, I have a hard time understanding the paper &quot;Learning Continuous Control Policies by Stochastic Value Gradients&quot; (https://arxiv.org/pdf/1510.09142.pdf). 
 So, in my understanding is that the stochastic value gradient could be computed easily on imagined (&quot;planned&quot;) data, where we rollout the policy in the learned world model. However, this seems undesirable due to compounding model errors. So far, so good.
 The above issue is fixed when we use real environment samples, although the noise variables η and ξ required to calculate the stochastic value gradient are then unknown. The paper then applies the Bayes rule to reformulate the stochastic value gradient to a tractable formulation.
 My issue: to compute the stochastic value gradient, the noise variables must be inferred. On this issue, the paper simply states &quot;... infer the missing noise variables, possibly by sampling from p(η,ξ|s, a, s′)&quot;. How can we sample these noise variables? How can we infer the noise variables?
 Any help would be greatly appreciated!

 While i was looking at the code that is provided by the author of MiniWorld i got a question. How i get training data? 
 The authors of Decision Transformer uses d4rl that provide some offline dataset. How can create training data in a similar way using my environment?

                    <span>Hello :D,
 I had a PPO implementation with convolutional neural networks that worked just fine with discrete action space (environment is a grid world where an agent has 4 possible actions&#x3D;directions). I took the same implementation and switched to continuous action space (2 actions &#x3D; force over x and y axis). The model does pretty well in the first 7mil steps (reward converges), but then the reward suddenly goes down. 
 Any idea what could be the reason? could it be the decaying variance I am using for the continuous action selection?

                    <span>The rapid growth of data in the recent years has led to the development of
complex learning algorithms that are often used to make decisions in real
world. While the positive impact of the algorithms has been tremendous, there
is a need to mitigate any bias arising from either training samples or implicit
assumptions made about the data samples. This need becomes critical when
algorithms are used in automated decision making systems that can hugely impact
people&#x27;s lives.

Many approaches have been proposed to make learning algorithms fair by
detecting and mitigating bias in different stages of optimization. However, due
to a lack of a universal definition of fairness, these algorithms optimize for
a particular interpretation of fairness which makes them limited for real world
use. Moreover, an underlying assumption that is common to all algorithms is the
apparent equivalence of achieving fairness and removing bias. In other words,
there is no user defined criteria that can be incorporated into the
optimization procedure for producing a fair algorithm. Motivated by these
shortcomings of existing methods, we propose the CONFAIR procedure that
produces a fair algorithm by incorporating user constraints into the
optimization procedure. Furthermore, we make the process interpretable by
estimating the most predictive features from data. We demonstrate the efficacy
of our approach on several real world datasets using different fairness
criteria.</span>

                    <span>In this paper, we introduce ML-Decoder, a new attention-based classification
head. ML-Decoder predicts the existence of class labels via queries, and
enables better utilization of spatial data compared to global average pooling.
By redesigning the decoder architecture, and using a novel group-decoding
scheme, ML-Decoder is highly efficient, and can scale well to thousands of
classes. Compared to using a larger backbone, ML-Decoder consistently provides
a better speed-accuracy trade-off. ML-Decoder is also versatile - it can be
used as a drop-in replacement for various classification heads, and generalize
to unseen classes when operated with word queries. Novel query augmentations
further improve its generalization ability. Using ML-Decoder, we achieve
state-of-the-art results on several classification tasks: on MS-COCO
multi-label, we reach 91.4% mAP; on NUS-WIDE zero-shot, we reach 31.1% ZSL mAP;
and on ImageNet single-label, we reach with vanilla ResNet50 backbone a new top
score of 80.7%, without extra data or distillation. Public code is available

                    <span>Reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms assume that users specify tasks by
manually writing down a reward function. However, this process can be laborious
and demands considerable technical expertise. Can we devise RL algorithms that
instead enable users to specify tasks simply by providing examples of
successful outcomes? In this paper, we derive a control algorithm that
maximizes the future probability of these successful outcome examples. Prior
work has approached similar problems with a two-stage process, first learning a
reward function and then optimizing this reward function using another RL
algorithm. In contrast, our method directly learns a value function from
transitions and successful outcomes, without learning this intermediate reward
function. Our method therefore requires fewer hyperparameters to tune and lines
of code to debug. We show that our method satisfies a new data-driven Bellman
equation, where examples take the place of the typical reward function term.
Experiments show that our approach outperforms prior methods that learn
explicit reward functions.</span>

                    <span>There has been an emerging paradigm shift from the era of &quot;internet AI&quot; to
&quot;embodied AI&quot;, where AI algorithms and agents no longer learn from datasets of
images, videos or text curated primarily from the internet. Instead, they learn
through interactions with their environments from an egocentric perception
similar to humans. Consequently, there has been substantial growth in the
demand for embodied AI simulators to support various embodied AI research
tasks. This growing interest in embodied AI is beneficial to the greater
pursuit of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), but there has not been a
contemporary and comprehensive survey of this field. This paper aims to provide
an encyclopedic survey for the field of embodied AI, from its simulators to its
research. By evaluating nine current embodied AI simulators with our proposed
seven features, this paper aims to understand the simulators in their provision
for use in embodied AI research and their limitations. Lastly, this paper
surveys the three main research tasks in embodied AI -- visual exploration,
visual navigation and embodied question answering (QA), covering the
state-of-the-art approaches, evaluation metrics and datasets. Finally, with the
new insights revealed through surveying the field, the paper will provide
suggestions for simulator-for-task selections and recommendations for the
future directions of the field.</span>

                    <span>We present a simple and intuitive approach for interactive control of
physically simulated characters. Our work builds upon generative adversarial
networks (GAN) and reinforcement learning, and introduces an imitation learning
framework where an ensemble of classifiers and an imitation policy are trained
in tandem given pre-processed reference clips. The classifiers are trained to
discriminate the reference motion from the motion generated by the imitation
policy, while the policy is rewarded for fooling the discriminators. Using our
GAN-based approach, multiple motor control policies can be trained separately
to imitate different behaviors. In runtime, our system can respond to external
control signal provided by the user and interactively switch between different
policies. Compared to existing methods, our proposed approach has the following
attractive properties: 1) achieves state-of-the-art imitation performance
without manually designing and fine tuning a reward function; 2) directly
controls the character without having to track any target reference pose
explicitly or implicitly through a phase state; and 3) supports interactive
policy switching without requiring any motion generation or motion matching
mechanism. We highlight the applicability of our approach in a range of
imitation and interactive control tasks, while also demonstrating its ability
to withstand external perturbations as well as to recover balance. Overall, our
approach generates high-fidelity motion, has low runtime cost, and can be
easily integrated into interactive applications and games.</span>

for generalized data in Banach spaces including representer theorems and
convergence theorems. The generalized data are composed of linear functionals
and real scalars as the input and output elements to represent the discrete
information of different local models. By the extension of the classical
machine learning, the empirical risks are computed by the generalized data and
the loss functions. According to the techniques of regularization, the exact
solutions are approximated globally by minimizing the regularized empirical
risks over the Banach spaces. The existence and convergence of the approximate
solutions are guaranteed by the relative compactness of the generalized input
data in the predual spaces of the Banach spaces.</span>

                    <span>Supervision for image-to-image translation (I2I) tasks is hard to come by,
but bears significant effect on the resulting quality. In this paper, we
observe that for many Unsupervised I2I (UI2I) scenarios, one domain is more
familiar than the other, and offers in-domain prior knowledge, such as semantic
segmentation. We argue that for complex scenes, figuring out the semantic
structure of the domain is hard, especially with no supervision, but is an
important part of a successful I2I operation. We hence introduce two techniques
to incorporate this invaluable in-domain prior knowledge for the benefit of
translation quality: through a novel Multi-Stream generator architecture, and
through a semantic segmentation-based regularization loss term. In essence, we
propose splitting the input data according to semantic masks, explicitly
guiding the network to different behavior for the different regions of the
image. In addition, we propose training a semantic segmentation network along
with the translation task, and to leverage this output as a loss term that
improves robustness. We validate our approach on urban data, demonstrating
superior quality in the challenging UI2I tasks of converting day images to
night ones. In addition, we also demonstrate how reinforcing the target dataset
with our augmented images improves the training of downstream tasks such as the
classical detection one.</span>

have achieved scalable Gaussian process inference with highly accurate point
predictions, in several implementations these iterative methods appear to
struggle with numerical instabilities in learning kernel hyperparameters, and
poor test likelihoods. By investigating CG tolerance, preconditioner rank, and
Lanczos decomposition rank, we provide a particularly simple prescription to
correct these issues: we recommend that one should use a small CG tolerance
($\epsilon \leq 0.01$) and a large root decomposition size ($r \geq 5000$).
Moreover, we show that L-BFGS-B is a compelling optimizer for Iterative GPs,
achieving convergence with fewer gradient updates.</span>

                    <span>Digitized documents such as scientific articles, tax forms, invoices,
contract papers, historic texts are widely used nowadays. These document images
could be degraded or damaged due to various reasons including poor lighting
conditions, shadow, distortions like noise and blur, aging, ink stain,
bleed-through, watermark, stamp, etc. Document image enhancement plays a
crucial role as a pre-processing step in many automated document analysis and
recognition tasks such as character recognition. With recent advances in deep
learning, many methods are proposed to enhance the quality of these document
images. In this paper, we review deep learning-based methods, datasets, and
metrics for six main document image enhancement tasks, including binarization,
debluring, denoising, defading, watermark removal, and shadow removal. We
summarize the recent works for each task and discuss their features,
challenges, and limitations. We introduce multiple document image enhancement
tasks that have received little to no attention, including over and under
exposure correction, super resolution, and bleed-through removal. We identify
several promising research directions and opportunities for future research.</span>

                    <span>We consider the data-driven discovery of governing equations from time-series
data in the limit of high noise. The algorithms developed describe an extensive
toolkit of methods for circumventing the deleterious effects of noise in the
context of the sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics (SINDy) framework.
We offer two primary contributions, both focused on noisy data acquired from a
system x&#x27; &#x3D; f(x). First, we propose, for use in high-noise settings, an
extensive toolkit of critically enabling extensions for the SINDy regression
method, to progressively cull functionals from an over-complete library and
yield a set of sparse equations that regress to the derivate x&#x27;. These
innovations can extract sparse governing equations and coefficients from
high-noise time-series data (e.g. 300% added noise). For example, it discovers
the correct sparse libraries in the Lorenz system, with median coefficient
estimate errors equal to 1% - 3% (for 50% noise), 6% - 8% (for 100% noise); and
23% - 25% (for 300% noise). The enabling modules in the toolkit are combined
into a single method, but the individual modules can be tactically applied in
other equation discovery methods (SINDy or not) to improve results on
high-noise data. Second, we propose a technique, applicable to any model
discovery method based on x&#x27; &#x3D; f(x), to assess the accuracy of a discovered
model in the context of non-unique solutions due to noisy data. Currently, this
non-uniqueness can obscure a discovered model&#x27;s accuracy and thus a discovery
method&#x27;s effectiveness. We describe a technique that uses linear dependencies
among functionals to transform a discovered model into an equivalent form that
is closest to the true model, enabling more accurate assessment of a discovered
model&#x27;s accuracy.</span>

                    <span>Bayesian models of behavior have provided computational level explanations in
a range of psychophysical tasks. One fundamental experimental paradigm is the
production or reproduction task, in which subjects are instructed to generate
an action that either reproduces a previously sensed stimulus magnitude or
achieves a target response. This type of task therefore distinguishes itself
from other psychophysical tasks in that the responses are on a continuum and
effort plays an important role with increasing response magnitude. Based on
Bayesian decision theory we present an inference method to recover perceptual
uncertainty, response variability, and the cost function underlying human
responses. Crucially, the cost function is parameterized such that effort is
explicitly included. We present a hybrid inference method employing MCMC
sampling utilizing appropriate proposal distributions and an inner loop
utilizing amortized inference with a neural network that approximates the mode
of the optimal response distribution. We show how this model can be utilized to
avoid unidentifiability of experimental designs and that parameters can be
recovered through validation on synthetic and application to experimental data.
Our approach will enable behavioral scientists to perform Bayesian inference of
decision making parameters in production and reproduction tasks.</span>

dynamical system in a Euclidean space of appropriate dimension through a
generic delay-observation map. The embedding also establishes a topological
conjugacy. In this paper, we show how an arbitrary sequence can be mapped into
another space as an attractive solution of a nonautonomous dynamical system.
Such mapping also entails a topological conjugacy and an embedding between the
sequence and the attractive solution spaces. This result is not a
generalization of Takens embedding theorem but helps us understand what exactly
is required by discrete-time state space models widely used in applications to
embed an external stimulus onto its solution space. Our results settle another
basic problem concerning the perturbation of an autonomous dynamical system. We
describe what exactly happens to the dynamics when exogenous noise perturbs
continuously a local irreducible attracting set (such as a stable fixed point)
of a discrete-time autonomous dynamical system.</span>

                    <span>Partial differential equations (PDEs) play a dominant role in the
mathematical modeling of many complex dynamical processes. Solving these PDEs
often requires prohibitively high computational costs, especially when multiple
evaluations must be made for different parameters or conditions. After
training, neural operators can provide PDEs solutions significantly faster than
traditional PDE solvers. In this work, invariance properties and computational
complexity of two neural operators are examined for transport PDE of a scalar
quantity. Neural operator based on graph kernel network (GKN) operates on
graph-structured data to incorporate nonlocal dependencies. Here we propose a
modified formulation of GKN to achieve frame invariance. Vector cloud neural
network (VCNN) is an alternate neural operator with embedded frame invariance
which operates on point cloud data. GKN-based neural operator demonstrates
slightly better predictive performance compared to VCNN. However, GKN requires
an excessively high computational cost that increases quadratically with the
increasing number of discretized objects as compared to a linear increase for
VCNN.</span>

                    <span>Federated edge learning (FEEL) has emerged as an effective approach to reduce
the large communication latency in Cloud-based machine learning solutions,
while preserving data privacy. Unfortunately, the learning performance of FEEL
may be compromised due to limited training data in a single edge cluster. In
this paper, we investigate a novel framework of FEEL, namely semi-decentralized
federated edge learning (SD-FEEL). By allowing model aggregation across
different edge clusters, SD-FEEL enjoys the benefit of FEEL in reducing the
training latency, while improving the learning performance by accessing richer
training data from multiple edge clusters. A training algorithm for SD-FEEL
with three main procedures in each round is presented, including local model
updates, intra-cluster and inter-cluster model aggregations, which is proved to
converge on non-independent and identically distributed (non-IID) data. We also
characterize the interplay between the network topology of the edge servers and
the communication overhead of inter-cluster model aggregation on the training
performance. Experiment results corroborate our analysis and demonstrate the
effectiveness of SD-FFEL in achieving faster convergence than traditional
federated learning architectures. Besides, guidelines on choosing critical
hyper-parameters of the training algorithm are also provided.</span>

                    <span>We present a unified analysis method that relies on the generalized cosine
rule and $\phi$-convex for online optimization in normed vector space using
dynamic regret as the performance metric. In combing the update rules, we start
with strategy $S$ (a two-parameter variant strategy covering Optimistic-FTRL
with surrogate linearized losses), and obtain $S$-I (type-I relaxation variant
form of $S$) and $S$-II (type-II relaxation variant form of $S$, which is
Optimistic-MD) by relaxation. Regret bounds for $S$-I and $S$-II are the
tightest possible. As instantiations, regret bounds of normalized exponentiated
subgradient and greedy/lazy projection are better than the currently known
optimal results. By replacing losses of online game with monotone operators,
and extending the definition of regret, namely regret$^n$, we extend online
convex optimization to online monotone optimization, which expands the
application scope of $S$-I and $S$-II.</span>

                    <span>Approximate message passing (AMP) is a promising technique for unknown signal
reconstruction of certain high-dimensional linear systems with non-Gaussian
signaling. A distinguished feature of the AMP-type algorithms is that their
dynamics can be rigorously described by state evolution. However, state
evolution does not necessarily guarantee the convergence of iterative
algorithms. To solve the convergence problem of AMP-type algorithms in
principle, this paper proposes a memory AMP (MAMP) under a sufficient statistic
condition, named sufficient statistic MAMP (SS-MAMP). We show that the
covariance matrices of SS-MAMP are L-banded and convergent. Given an arbitrary
MAMP, we can construct an SS-MAMP by damping, which not only ensures the
convergence of MAMP but also preserves the orthogonality of MAMP, i.e., its
dynamics can be rigorously described by state evolution. As a byproduct, we
prove that the Bayes-optimal orthogonal/vector AMP (BO-OAMP/VAMP) is an
SS-MAMP. As a result, we reveal two interesting properties of BO-OAMP/VAMP for
large systems: 1) the covariance matrices are L-banded and are convergent in
BO-OAMP/VAMP, and 2) damping and memory are useless (i.e., do not bring
performance improvement) in BO-OAMP/VAMP. As an example, we construct a
sufficient statistic Bayes-optimal MAMP (BO-MAMP), which is Bayes optimal if
its state evolution has a unique fixed point and its MSE is not worse than the
original BO-MAMP. Finally, simulations are provided to verify the validity and
accuracy of the theoretical results.</span>

                    <span>Optimal transport (OT) and its entropy regularized offspring have recently
gained a lot of attention in both machine learning and AI domains. In
particular, optimal transport has been used to develop probability metrics
between probability distributions. We introduce in this paper an independence
criterion based on entropy regularized optimal transport. Our criterion can be
used to test for independence between two samples. We establish non-asymptotic
bounds for our test statistic, and study its statistical behavior under both
the null and alternative hypothesis. Our theoretical results involve tools from
U-process theory and optimal transport theory. We present experimental results
on existing benchmarks, illustrating the interest of the proposed criterion.</span>

                    <span>The gradient noise of Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) is considered to play
a key role in its properties (e.g. escaping low potential points and
regularization). Past research has indicated that the covariance of the SGD
error done via minibatching plays a critical role in determining its
regularization and escape from low potential points. It is however not much
explored how much the distribution of the error influences the behavior of the
algorithm. Motivated by some new research in this area, we prove universality
results by showing that noise classes that have the same mean and covariance
structure of SGD via minibatching have similar properties. We mainly consider
the Multiplicative Stochastic Gradient Descent (M-SGD) algorithm as introduced
by Wu et al., which has a much more general noise class than the SGD algorithm
done via minibatching. We establish nonasymptotic bounds for the M-SGD
algorithm mainly with respect to the Stochastic Differential Equation
corresponding to SGD via minibatching. We also show that the M-SGD error is
approximately a scaled Gaussian distribution with mean $0$ at any fixed point
of the M-SGD algorithm. We also establish bounds for the convergence of the
M-SGD algorithm in the strongly convex regime.</span>

                    <span>The importance of deep learning data privacy has gained significant attention
in recent years. It is probably to suffer data breaches when applying deep
learning to cryptocurrency that lacks supervision of financial regulatory
agencies. However, there is little relative research in the financial area to
our best knowledge. We apply two representative deep learning privacy-privacy
frameworks proposed by Google to financial trading data. We designed the
experiments with several different parameters suggested from the original
studies. In addition, we refer the degree of privacy to Google and Apple
companies to estimate the results more reasonably. The results show that DP-SGD
performs better than the PATE framework in financial trading data. The tradeoff
between privacy and accuracy is low in DP-SGD. The degree of privacy also is in
line with the actual case. Therefore, we can obtain a strong privacy guarantee
with precision to avoid potential financial loss.</span>

                    <span>Score-based generative models (SGMs) have demonstrated remarkable synthesis
quality. SGMs rely on a diffusion process that gradually perturbs the data
towards a tractable distribution, while the generative model learns to denoise.
The complexity of this denoising task is, apart from the data distribution
itself, uniquely determined by the diffusion process. We argue that current
SGMs employ overly simplistic diffusions, leading to unnecessarily complex
denoising processes, which limit generative modeling performance. Based on
connections to statistical mechanics, we propose a novel critically-damped
Langevin diffusion (CLD) and show that CLD-based SGMs achieve superior
performance. CLD can be interpreted as running a joint diffusion in an extended
space, where the auxiliary variables can be considered &quot;velocities&quot; that are
coupled to the data variables as in Hamiltonian dynamics. We derive a novel
score matching objective for CLD and show that the model only needs to learn
the score function of the conditional distribution of the velocity given data,
an easier task than learning scores of the data directly. We also derive a new
sampling scheme for efficient synthesis from CLD-based diffusion models. We
find that CLD outperforms previous SGMs in synthesis quality for similar
network architectures and sampling compute budgets. We show that our novel
sampler for CLD significantly outperforms solvers such as Euler--Maruyama. Our
framework provides new insights into score-based denoising diffusion models and
can be readily used for high-resolution image synthesis. Project page and code:

policies directly from offline data. In this work, we ask the question of the

objective is to emphasize that studying sample complexity for offline RL is
important, and is an indicator of the usefulness of existing offline
algorithms. We propose an evaluation approach for sample complexity analysis of

                    <span>Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are acknowledged as vulnerable to adversarial
attacks, while the existing black-box attacks require extensive queries on the
victim DNN to achieve high success rates. For query-efficiency, surrogate
models of the victim are used to generate transferable Adversarial Examples
(AEs) because of their Gradient Similarity (GS), i.e., surrogates&#x27; attack
gradients are similar to the victim&#x27;s ones. However, it is generally neglected
to exploit their similarity on outputs, namely the Prediction Similarity (PS),
to filter out inefficient queries by surrogates without querying the victim. To
jointly utilize and also optimize surrogates&#x27; GS and PS, we develop QueryNet, a
unified attack framework that can significantly reduce queries. QueryNet
creatively attacks by multi-identity surrogates, i.e., crafts several AEs for
one sample by different surrogates, and also uses surrogates to decide on the
most promising AE for the query. After that, the victim&#x27;s query feedback is
accumulated to optimize not only surrogates&#x27; parameters but also their
architectures, enhancing both the GS and the PS. Although QueryNet has no
access to pre-trained surrogates&#x27; prior, it reduces queries by averagely about
an order of magnitude compared to alternatives within an acceptable time,
according to our comprehensive experiments: 11 victims (including two
commercial models) on MNIST/CIFAR10/ImageNet, allowing only 8-bit image
queries, and no access to the victim&#x27;s training data. The code is available at

disentanglement remains difficult to find. Here we investigate the original

                    <span>The statefulness property of network protocol implementations poses a unique
challenge for testing and verification techniques, including Fuzzing. Stateful
fuzzers tackle this challenge by leveraging state models to partition the state
space and assist the test generation process. Since not all states are equally
important and fuzzing campaigns have time limits, fuzzers need effective state
selection algorithms to prioritize progressive states over others. Several
state selection algorithms have been proposed but they were implemented and
evaluated separately on different platforms, making it hard to achieve
conclusive findings. In this work, we evaluate an extensive set of state
selection algorithms on the same fuzzing platform that is AFLNet, a
state-of-the-art fuzzer for network servers. The algorithm set includes
existing ones supported by AFLNet and our novel and principled algorithm called
AFLNetLegion. The experimental results on the ProFuzzBench benchmark show that
(i) the existing state selection algorithms of AFLNet achieve very similar code
coverage, (ii) AFLNetLegion clearly outperforms these algorithms in selected
case studies, but (iii) the overall improvement appears insignificant. These
are unexpected yet interesting findings. We identify problems and share
insights that could open opportunities for future research on this topic.</span>

                    <span>The latest advances of statistical physics have shown remarkable performance
of machine learning in identifying phase transitions. In this paper, we apply
domain adversarial neural network (DANN) based on transfer learning to studying
non-equilibrium and equilibrium phase transition models, which are percolation
model and directed percolation (DP) model, respectively. With the DANN, only a
small fraction of input configurations (2d images) needs to be labeled, which
is automatically chosen, in order to capture the critical point. To learn the
DP model, the method is refined by an iterative procedure in determining the
critical point, which is a prerequisite for the data collapse in calculating
the critical exponent $\nu_{\perp}$. We then apply the DANN to a
two-dimensional site percolation with configurations filtered to include only
the largest cluster which may contain the information related to the order
parameter. The DANN learning of both models yields reliable results which are
comparable to the ones from Monte Carlo simulations. Our study also shows that
the DANN can achieve quite high accuracy at much lower cost, compared to the
supervised learning.</span>

replay, have achieved state-of-the-art performance. These approaches save a
small part of the data of the past tasks as a memory buffer to prevent models
from forgetting previously learned knowledge. However, most of them treat every
new task equally, i.e., fixed the hyperparameters of the framework while
learning different new tasks. Such a setting lacks the consideration of the
relationship/similarity between past and new tasks. For example, the previous
knowledge/features learned from dogs are more beneficial for the identification
of cats (new task), compared to those learned from buses. In this regard, we
propose a meta learning algorithm based on bi-level optimization to adaptively
tune the relationship between the knowledge extracted from the past and new
tasks. Therefore, the model can find an appropriate direction of gradient
during continual learning and avoid the serious overfitting problem on memory
buffer. Extensive experiments are conducted on three publicly available
datasets (i.e., CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and Tiny ImageNet). The experimental
results demonstrate that the proposed method can consistently improve the
performance of all baselines.</span>

                    <span>A trivializing map is a field transformation whose Jacobian determinant
exactly cancels the interaction terms in the action, providing a representation
of the theory in terms of a deterministic transformation of a distribution from
which sampling is trivial. Recently, a proof-of-principle study by Albergo,
Kanwar and Shanahan [arXiv:1904.12072] demonstrated that approximations of
trivializing maps can be &#x60;machine-learned&#x27; by a class of invertible,
differentiable neural models called \textit{normalizing flows}. By ensuring
that the Jacobian determinant can be computed efficiently, asymptotically exact
sampling from the theory of interest can be performed by drawing samples from a
simple distribution and passing them through the network. From a theoretical
perspective, this approach has the potential to become more efficient than
traditional Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampling techniques, where
autocorrelations severely diminish the sampling efficiency as one approaches
the continuum limit. A major caveat is that it is not yet understood how the
size of models and the cost of training them is expected to scale. As a first
step, we have conducted an exploratory scaling study using two-dimensional
$\phi^4$ with up to $20^2$ lattice sites. Although the scope of our study is
limited to a particular model architecture and training algorithm, initial
results paint an interesting picture in which training costs grow very quickly
indeed. We describe a candidate explanation for the poor scaling, and outline
our intentions to clarify the situation in future work.</span>

                    <span>Large-scale datasets are important for the development of deep learning
models. Such datasets usually require a heavy workload of annotations, which
are extremely time-consuming and expensive. To accelerate the annotation
procedure, multiple annotators may be employed to label different subsets of
the data. However, the inconsistency and bias among different annotators are
harmful to the model training, especially for qualitative and subjective
tasks.To address this challenge, in this paper, we propose a novel contrastive
regression framework to address the disjoint annotations problem, where each
sample is labeled by only one annotator and multiple annotators work on
disjoint subsets of the data. To take account of both the intra-annotator
consistency and inter-annotator inconsistency, two strategies are
employed.Firstly, a contrastive-based loss is applied to learn the relative
ranking among different samples of the same annotator, with the assumption that
the ranking of samples from the same annotator is unanimous. Secondly, we apply
the gradient reversal layer to learn robust representations that are invariant
to different annotators. Experiments on the facial expression prediction task,
as well as the image quality assessment task, verify the effectiveness of our
proposed framework.</span>

                    <span>A long standing problem in the modeling of non-Newtonian hydrodynamics is the
availability of reliable and interpretable hydrodynamic models that faithfully
encode the underlying micro-scale polymer dynamics. The main complication
arises from the long polymer relaxation time, the complex molecular structure,
and heterogeneous interaction. DeePN$^2$, a deep learning-based non-Newtonian
hydrodynamic model, has been proposed and has shown some success in
systematically passing the micro-scale structural mechanics information to the
macro-scale hydrodynamics for suspensions with simple polymer conformation and
bond potential. The model retains a multi-scaled nature by mapping the polymer
configurations into a set of symmetry-preserving macro-scale features. The
extended constitutive laws for these macro-scale features can be directly
learned from the kinetics of their micro-scale counterparts. In this paper, we
carry out further study of DeePN$^2$ using more complex micro-structural
models. We show that DeePN$^2$ can faithfully capture the broadly overlooked
viscoelastic differences arising from the specific molecular structural
mechanics without human intervention.</span>

                    <span>Graph neural network (GNN) has shown convincing performance in learning
powerful node representations that preserve both node attributes and graph
structural information. However, many GNNs encounter problems in effectiveness
and efficiency when they are designed with a deeper network structure or handle
large-sized graphs. Several sampling algorithms have been proposed for
improving and accelerating the training of GNNs, yet they ignore understanding
the source of GNN performance gain. The measurement of information within graph
data can help the sampling algorithms to keep high-value information while
removing redundant information and even noise. In this paper, we propose a
Metric-Guided (MeGuide) subgraph learning framework for GNNs. MeGuide employs
two novel metrics: Feature Smoothness and Connection Failure Distance to guide
the subgraph sampling and mini-batch based training. Feature Smoothness is
designed for analyzing the feature of nodes in order to retain the most
valuable information, while Connection Failure Distance can measure the
structural information to control the size of subgraphs. We demonstrate the
effectiveness and efficiency of MeGuide in training various GNNs on multiple
datasets.</span>

                    <span>One of the reasons that many neural networks are capable of replicating
complicated tasks or functions is their universality property. The past few
decades have seen many attempts in providing constructive proofs for single or
class of neural networks. This paper is an effort to provide a unified and
constructive framework for the universality of a large class of activations
including most of existing activations and beyond. At the heart of the
framework is the concept of neural network approximate identity. It turns out
that most of existing activations are neural network approximate identity, and
thus universal in the space of continuous of functions on compacta. The
framework induces several advantages. First, it is constructive with elementary
means from functional analysis, probability theory, and numerical analysis.
Second, it is the first unified attempt that is valid for most of existing
activations. Third, as a by product, the framework provides the first
university proof for some of the existing activation functions including Mish,
SiLU, ELU, GELU, and etc. Fourth, it discovers new activations with guaranteed
universality property. Indeed, any activation\textemdash whose $\k$th
derivative, with $\k$ being an integer, is integrable and essentially
bounded\textemdash is universal. Fifth, for a given activation and error
tolerance, the framework provides precisely the architecture of the
corresponding one-hidden neural network with predetermined number of neuron,
and the values of weights/biases.</span>

                    <span>For strongly convex objectives that are smooth, the classical theory of
gradient descent ensures linear convergence relative to the number of gradient
evaluations. An analogous nonsmooth theory is challenging: even when the
objective is smooth at every iterate, the corresponding local models are
unstable, and traditional remedies need unpredictably many cutting planes. We
instead propose a multipoint generalization of the gradient descent iteration
for local optimization. While designed with general objectives in mind, we are
motivated by a &quot;max-of-smooth&quot; model that captures subdifferential dimension at
optimality. We prove linear convergence when the objective is itself
max-of-smooth, and experiments suggest a more general phenomenon.</span>

                    <span>Reinforcement learning has recently shown promise in learning quality
solutions in many combinatorial optimization problems. In particular, the
attention-based encoder-decoder models show high effectiveness on various
routing problems, including the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP).
Unfortunately, they perform poorly for the TSP with Drone (TSP-D), requiring
routing a heterogeneous fleet of vehicles in coordination -- a truck and a
drone. In TSP-D, the two vehicles are moving in tandem and may need to wait at
a node for the other vehicle to join. State-less attention-based decoder fails
to make such coordination between vehicles. We propose an attention
encoder-LSTM decoder hybrid model, in which the decoder&#x27;s hidden state can
represent the sequence of actions made. We empirically demonstrate that such a
hybrid model improves upon a purely attention-based model for both solution
quality and computational efficiency. Our experiments on the min-max
Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (mmCVRP) also confirm that the hybrid model
is more suitable for coordinated routing of multiple vehicles than the
attention-based model.</span>

                    <span>Unified understanding of neuro networks (NNs) gets the users into great
trouble because they have been puzzled by what kind of rules should be obeyed
to optimize the internal structure of NNs. Considering the potential capability
of random graphs to alter how computation is performed, we demonstrate that
they can serve as architecture generators to optimize the internal structure of
NNs. To transform the random graph theory into an NN model with practical
meaning and based on clarifying the input-output relationship of each neuron,
we complete data feature mapping by calculating Fourier Random Features (FRFs).
Under the usage of this low-operation cost approach, neurons are assigned to
several groups of which connection relationships can be regarded as uniform
representations of random graphs they belong to, and random arrangement fuses
those neurons to establish the pattern matrix, markedly reducing manual
participation and computational cost without the fixed and deep architecture.
Leveraging this single neuromorphic learning model termed random graph-based
neuro network (RGNN) we develop a joint classification mechanism involving
information interaction between multiple RGNNs and realize significant
performance improvements in supervised learning for three benchmark tasks,
whereby they effectively avoid the adverse impact of the interpretability of
NNs on the structure design and engineering practice.</span>

                    <span>&quot;Benign overfitting&quot;, where classifiers memorize noisy training data yet
still achieve a good generalization performance, has drawn great attention in
the machine learning community. To explain this surprising phenomenon, a series
of works have provided theoretical justification in over-parameterized linear
regression, classification, and kernel methods. However, it is not clear if
benign overfitting still occurs in the presence of adversarial examples, i.e.,
examples with tiny and intentional perturbations to fool the classifiers. In
this paper, we show that benign overfitting indeed occurs in adversarial
training, a principled approach to defend against adversarial examples. In
detail, we prove the risk bounds of the adversarially trained linear classifier
on the mixture of sub-Gaussian data under $\ell_p$ adversarial perturbations.
Our result suggests that under moderate perturbations, adversarially trained
linear classifiers can achieve the near-optimal standard and adversarial risks,
despite overfitting the noisy training data. Numerical experiments validate our
theoretical findings.</span>

technique to improve the generalization of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). Our
method leverages the recent advances in Mixup regularizer for vision and text,
where random sample pairs and their labels are interpolated to create synthetic
samples for training. Unlike images or natural sentences, graphs have arbitrary
structure and topology, and even simply deleting or adding one edge from a
graph can dramatically change its semantic meanings. This makes interpolating
graph inputs very challenging because mixing graph pairs may naturally create
graphs with identical structure but with conflict labels, causing the manifold
intrusion issue. To cope with this obstacle, we propose a simple input mixing
schema for Mixup on graph, coined ifMixup. We theoretically prove that, with a
mild assumption, ifMixup guarantees that the mixed graphs are manifold
intrusion free. We also empirically verify that ifMixup can effectively
regularize the graph classification learning, resulting in superior predictive
accuracy over popular graph augmentation baselines.</span>

                    <span>Realistically -- and equitably -- modeling the dynamics of group-level
disparities in machine learning remains an open problem. In particular, we
desire models that do not suppose inherent differences between artificial
groups of people -- but rather endogenize disparities by appeal to unequal
initial conditions of insular subpopulations. In this paper, agents each have a
real-valued feature $X$ (e.g., credit score) informed by a &quot;true&quot; binary label
$Y$ representing qualification (e.g., for a loan). Each agent alternately (1)
receives a binary classification label $\hat{Y}$ (e.g., loan approval) from a
Bayes-optimal machine learning classifier observing $X$ and (2) may update
their qualification $Y$ by imitating successful strategies (e.g., seek a raise)
within an isolated group $G$ of agents to which they belong. We consider the
disparity of qualification rates $\Pr(Y&#x3D;1)$ between different groups and how
this disparity changes subject to a sequence of Bayes-optimal classifiers
repeatedly retrained on the global population. We model the evolving
qualification rates of each subpopulation (group) using the replicator
equation, which derives from a class of imitation processes. We show that
differences in qualification rates between subpopulations can persist
indefinitely for a set of non-trivial equilibrium states due to uniformed
classifier deployments, even when groups are identical in all aspects except
initial qualification densities. We next simulate the effects of commonly
proposed fairness interventions on this dynamical system along with a new
feedback control mechanism capable of permanently eliminating group-level
qualification rate disparities. We conclude by discussing the limitations of
our model and findings and by outlining potential future work.</span>

                    <span>Identifying anomalies refers to detecting samples that do not resemble the
training data distribution. Many generative models have been used to find
anomalies, and among them, generative adversarial network (GAN)-based
approaches are currently very popular. GANs mainly rely on the rich contextual
information of these models to identify the actual training distribution.
Following this analogy, we suggested a new unsupervised model based on GANs --a
combination of an autoencoder and a GAN. Further, a new scoring function was
introduced to target anomalies where a linear combination of the internal
representation of the discriminator and the generator&#x27;s visual representation,
plus the encoded representation of the autoencoder, come together to define the
proposed anomaly score. The model was further evaluated on benchmark datasets
such as SVHN, CIFAR10, and MNIST, as well as a public medical dataset of
leukemia images. In all the experiments, our model outperformed its existing
counterparts while slightly improving the inference time.</span>

                    <span>We study the model-based reward-free reinforcement learning with linear
function approximation for episodic Markov decision processes (MDPs). In this
setting, the agent works in two phases. In the exploration phase, the agent
interacts with the environment and collects samples without the reward. In the
planning phase, the agent is given a specific reward function and uses samples
collected from the exploration phase to learn a good policy. We propose a new
provably efficient algorithm, called UCRL-RFE under the Linear Mixture MDP
assumption, where the transition probability kernel of the MDP can be
parameterized by a linear function over certain feature mappings defined on the
triplet of state, action, and next state. We show that to obtain an
$\epsilon$-optimal policy for arbitrary reward function, UCRL-RFE needs to
sample at most $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(H^5d^2\epsilon^{-2})$ episodes during the
exploration phase. Here, $H$ is the length of the episode, $d$ is the dimension
of the feature mapping. We also propose a variant of UCRL-RFE using
Bernstein-type bonus and show that it needs to sample at most
$\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(H^4d(H + d)\epsilon^{-2})$ to achieve an
$\epsilon$-optimal policy. By constructing a special class of linear Mixture
MDPs, we also prove that for any reward-free algorithm, it needs to sample at
least $\tilde \Omega(H^2d\epsilon^{-2})$ episodes to obtain an
$\epsilon$-optimal policy. Our upper bound matches the lower bound in terms of
the dependence on $\epsilon$ and the dependence on $d$ if $H \ge d$.</span>

                    <span>Current models on Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) have shown an
evident and quantified lack of reliability for measuring feature-relevance when
statistically entangled features are proposed for training deep classifiers.
There has been an increase in the application of Deep Learning in clinical
trials to predict early diagnosis of neuro-developmental disorders, such as
Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). However, the inclusion of more reliable
saliency-maps to obtain more trustworthy and interpretable metrics using neural
activity features is still insufficiently mature for practical applications in
diagnostics or clinical trials. Moreover, in ASD research the inclusion of deep
classifiers that use neural measures to predict viewed facial emotions is
relatively unexplored. Therefore, in this study we propose the evaluation of a
Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for electroencephalography (EEG)-based
facial emotion recognition decoding complemented with a novel
RemOve-And-Retrain (ROAR) methodology to recover highly relevant features used
in the classifier. Specifically, we compare well-known relevance maps such as
Layer-Wise Relevance Propagation (LRP), PatternNet, Pattern-Attribution, and
Smooth-Grad Squared. This study is the first to consolidate a more transparent
feature-relevance calculation for a successful EEG-based facial emotion
recognition using a within-subject-trained CNN in typically-developed and ASD
individuals.</span>

                    <span>Bayesian optimization has proven to be an efficient method to optimize
expensive-to-evaluate systems. However, depending on the cost of single
observations, multi-dimensional optimizations of one or more objectives may
still be prohibitively expensive. Multi-fidelity optimization remedies this
issue by including multiple, cheaper information sources such as low-resolution
approximations in numerical simulations. Acquisition functions for
multi-fidelity optimization are typically based on exploration-heavy algorithms
that are difficult to combine with optimization towards multiple objectives.

Here we show that the expected hypervolume improvement policy can act in many
situations as a suitable substitute. We incorporate the evaluation cost either
via a two-step evaluation or within a single acquisition function with an
additional fidelity-related objective. This permits simultaneous
multi-objective and multi-fidelity optimization, which allows to accurately
establish the Pareto set and front at fractional cost. Benchmarks show a cost
reduction of an order of magnitude or more. Our method thus allows for Pareto
optimization of extremely expansive black-box functions.

The presented methods are simple and straightforward to implement in
existing, optimized Bayesian optimization frameworks and can immediately be
extended to batch optimization. The techniques can also be used to combine
different continuous and/or discrete fidelity dimensions, which makes them
particularly relevant for simulation problems in plasma physics, fluid dynamics
and many other branches of scientific computing.</span>

                    <span>Scene Graph Generation (SGG) remains a challenging visual understanding task
due to its complex compositional property. Most previous works adopt a
bottom-up two-stage or a point-based one-stage approach, which often suffers
from overhead time complexity or sub-optimal design assumption. In this work,
we propose a novel SGG method to address the aforementioned issues, which
formulates the task as a bipartite graph construction problem. To solve the
problem, we develop a transformer-based end-to-end framework that first
generates the entity and predicate proposal set, followed by inferring directed
edges to form the relation triplets. In particular, we develop a new
entity-aware predicate representation based on a structural predicate generator
to leverage the compositional property of relationships. Moreover, we design a
graph assembling module to infer the connectivity of the bipartite scene graph
based on our entity-aware structure, enabling us to generate the scene graph in
an end-to-end manner. Extensive experimental results show that our design is
able to achieve the state-of-the-art or comparable performance on two
challenging benchmarks, surpassing most of the existing approaches and enjoying
higher efficiency in inference. We hope our model can serve as a strong
baseline for the Transformer-based scene graph generation.</span>

                    <span>Thompson Sampling (TS) is one of the most effective algorithms for solving
contextual multi-armed bandit problems. In this paper, we propose a new
algorithm, called Neural Thompson Sampling, which adapts deep neural networks
for both exploration and exploitation. At the core of our algorithm is a novel
posterior distribution of the reward, where its mean is the neural network
approximator, and its variance is built upon the neural tangent features of the
corresponding neural network. We prove that, provided the underlying reward
function is bounded, the proposed algorithm is guaranteed to achieve a
cumulative regret of $\mathcal{O}(T^{1/2})$, which matches the regret of other
contextual bandit algorithms in terms of total round number $T$. Experimental
comparisons with other benchmark bandit algorithms on various data sets
corroborate our theory.</span>

transform (DWT) and Machine learning classifiers. Here DWT has been used for
feature extraction as it provides a better decomposition of the signals in
different frequency bands. At first, DWT has been applied to the EEG signal to
extract the detail and approximate coefficients or different sub-bands. After
the extraction of the coefficients, principal component analysis (PCA) has been
applied on different sub-bands and then a feature level fusion technique is
used to extract the important features in low dimensional feature space. Three
classifiers namely: Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier, K-Nearest-Neighbor

                    <span>Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have achieved remarkable success in
automatically segmenting organs or lesions on 3D medical images. Recently,
vision transformer networks have exhibited exceptional performance in 2D image
classification tasks. Compared with CNNs, transformer networks have an
appealing advantage of extracting long-range features due to their
self-attention algorithm. Therefore, we propose a CNN-Transformer combined

segmentation on multi-modal MRI scans. Our BiTr-Unet achieves good performance

                    <span>Deep Reinforcement Learning (RL) is a powerful framework for solving complex
real-world problems. Large neural networks employed in the framework are
traditionally associated with better generalization capabilities, but their
increased size entails the drawbacks of extensive training duration,
substantial hardware resources, and longer inference times. One way to tackle
this problem is to prune neural networks leaving only the necessary parameters.
State-of-the-art concurrent pruning techniques for imposing sparsity perform
demonstrably well in applications where data distributions are fixed. However,
they have not yet been substantially explored in the context of RL. We close
the gap between RL and single-shot pruning techniques and present a general
pruning approach to the Offline RL. We leverage a fixed dataset to prune neural
networks before the start of RL training. We then run experiments varying the
network sparsity level and evaluating the validity of pruning at initialization
techniques in continuous control tasks. Our results show that with 95% of the
network weights pruned, Offline-RL algorithms can still retain performance in
the majority of our experiments. To the best of our knowledge, no prior work
utilizing pruning in RL retained performance at such high levels of sparsity.

Moreover, pruning at initialization techniques can be easily integrated into
any existing Offline-RL algorithms without changing the learning objective.</span>

                    <span>Sampling from an unnormalized probability distribution is a fundamental
problem in machine learning with applications including Bayesian modeling,
latent factor inference, and energy-based model training. After decades of
research, variations of MCMC remain the default approach to sampling despite
slow convergence. Auxiliary neural models can learn to speed up MCMC, but the
overhead for training the extra model can be prohibitive. We propose a
fundamentally different approach to this problem via a new Hamiltonian dynamics
with a non-Newtonian momentum. In contrast to MCMC approaches like Hamiltonian
Monte Carlo, no stochastic step is required. Instead, the proposed
deterministic dynamics in an extended state space exactly sample the target
distribution, specified by an energy function, under an assumption of
ergodicity. Alternatively, the dynamics can be interpreted as a normalizing
flow that samples a specified energy model without training. The proposed
Energy Sampling Hamiltonian (ESH) dynamics have a simple form that can be
solved with existing ODE solvers, but we derive a specialized solver that
exhibits much better performance. ESH dynamics converge faster than their MCMC
competitors enabling faster, more stable training of neural network energy
models.</span>

anchors to enforce different views of a given image to be assigned to the same

                    <span>The effectiveness of traditional traffic prediction methods is often
extremely limited when forecasting traffic dynamics in early morning. The
reason is that traffic can break down drastically during the early morning
commute, and the time and duration of this break-down vary substantially from
day to day. Early morning traffic forecast is crucial to inform morning-commute
traffic management, but they are generally challenging to predict in advance,
particularly by midnight. In this paper, we propose to mine Twitter messages as
a probing method to understand the impacts of people&#x27;s work and rest patterns
in the evening/midnight of the previous day to the next-day morning traffic.
The model is tested on freeway networks in Pittsburgh as experiments. The
resulting relationship is surprisingly simple and powerful. We find that, in
general, the earlier people rest as indicated from Tweets, the more congested
roads will be in the next morning. The occurrence of big events in the evening
before, represented by higher or lower tweet sentiment than normal, often
implies lower travel demand in the next morning than normal days. Besides,
people&#x27;s tweeting activities in the night before and early morning are
statistically associated with congestion in morning peak hours. We make use of
such relationships to build a predictive framework which forecasts morning
commute congestion using people&#x27;s tweeting profiles extracted by 5 am or as
late as the midnight prior to the morning. The Pittsburgh study supports that
our framework can precisely predict morning congestion, particularly for some
road segments upstream of roadway bottlenecks with large day-to-day congestion
variation. Our approach considerably outperforms those existing methods without
Twitter message features, and it can learn meaningful representation of demand
from tweeting profiles that offer managerial insights.</span>

has focused on the question of how to visually interpret CNNs, we ask what it
is that we care to interpret, that is, which layers and neurons are worth our
attention? Due to the vast size of modern deep learning network architectures,
automated, quantitative methods are needed to rank the relative importance of
neurons so as to provide an answer to this question. We present a new
statistical method for ranking the hidden neurons in any convolutional layer of
a network. We define importance as the maximal correlation between the
activation maps and the class score. We provide different ways in which this
method can be used for visualization purposes with MNIST and ImageNet, and show
a real-world application of our method to air pollution prediction with
street-level images.</span>

                    <span>Globally, there is a substantial unmet need to diagnose various diseases
effectively. The complexity of the different disease mechanisms and underlying
symptoms of the patient population presents massive challenges to developing
the early diagnosis tool and effective treatment. Machine Learning (ML), an
area of Artificial Intelligence (AI), enables researchers, physicians, and
patients to solve some of these issues. Based on relevant research, this review
explains how Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) are being used to
help in the early identification of numerous diseases. To begin, a bibliometric
study of the publication is given using data from the Scopus and Web of Science
(WOS) databases. The bibliometric study of 1216 publications was undertaken to
determine the most prolific authors, nations, organizations, and most cited
articles. The review then summarizes the most recent trends and approaches in
Machine Learning-based Disease Diagnosis (MLBDD), considering the following
factors: algorithm, disease types, data type, application, and evaluation
metrics. Finally, the paper highlights key results and provides insight into
future trends and opportunities in the MLBDD area.</span>

                    <span>We introduce BERTphone, a Transformer encoder trained on large speech corpora
that outputs phonetically-aware contextual representation vectors that can be
used for both speaker and language recognition. This is accomplished by
training on two objectives: the first, inspired by adapting BERT to the
continuous domain, involves masking spans of input frames and reconstructing
the whole sequence for acoustic representation learning; the second, inspired
by the success of bottleneck features from ASR, is a sequence-level CTC loss
applied to phoneme labels for phonetic representation learning. We pretrain two
BERTphone models (one on Fisher and one on TED-LIUM) and use them as feature
extractors into x-vector-style DNNs for both tasks. We attain a
state-of-the-art $C_{\text{avg}}$ of 6.16 on the challenging LRE07 3sec
closed-set language recognition task. On Fisher and VoxCeleb speaker
recognition tasks, we see an 18% relative reduction in speaker EER when
training on BERTphone vectors instead of MFCCs. In general, BERTphone
outperforms previous phonetic pretraining approaches on the same data. We
release our code and models at

                    <span>Tree-based algorithms such as random forests and gradient boosted trees
continue to be among the most popular and powerful machine learning models used
across multiple disciplines. The conventional wisdom of estimating the impact
of a feature in tree based models is to measure the \textit{node-wise reduction
of a loss function}, which (i) yields only global importance measures and (ii)
is known to suffer from severe biases. Conditional feature contributions (CFCs)
provide \textit{local}, case-by-case explanations of a prediction by following
the decision path and attributing changes in the expected output of the model
to each feature along the path. However, Lundberg et al. pointed out a
potential bias of CFCs which depends on the distance from the root of a tree.
The by now immensely popular alternative, SHapley Additive exPlanation (SHAP)
values appear to mitigate this bias but are computationally much more
expensive. Here we contribute a thorough comparison of the explanations
computed by both methods on a set of 164 publicly available classification
problems in order to provide data-driven algorithm recommendations to current
researchers. For random forests, we find extremely high similarities and
correlations of both local and global SHAP values and CFC scores, leading to
very similar rankings and interpretations. Analogous conclusions hold for the
fidelity of using global feature importance scores as a proxy for the
predictive power associated with each feature.</span>

                    <span>Alternating gradient-descent-ascent (AltGDA) is an optimization algorithm
that has been widely used for model training in various machine learning
applications, which aim to solve a nonconvex minimax optimization problem.
However, the existing studies show that it suffers from a high computation
complexity in nonconvex minimax optimization. In this paper, we develop a
single-loop and fast AltGDA-type algorithm that leverages proximal gradient
updates and momentum acceleration to solve regularized nonconvex minimax
optimization problems. By identifying the intrinsic Lyapunov function of this
algorithm, we prove that it converges to a critical point of the nonconvex
minimax optimization problem and achieves a computation complexity
$\mathcal{O}(\kappa^{1.5}\epsilon^{-2})$, where $\epsilon$ is the desired level
of accuracy and $\kappa$ is the problem&#x27;s condition number. Such a computation
complexity improves the state-of-the-art complexities of single-loop GDA and
AltGDA algorithms (see the summary of comparison in Table 1). We demonstrate
the effectiveness of our algorithm via an experiment on adversarial deep
learning.</span>

                    <span>Learning continually and online from a continuous stream of data is
challenging, especially for a reinforcement learning agent with sequential
data. When the environment only provides observations giving partial
information about the state of the environment, the agent must learn the agent
state based on the data stream of experience. We refer to the state learned
directly from the data stream of experience as the agent state. Recurrent
neural networks can learn the agent state, but the training methods are
computationally expensive and sensitive to the hyper-parameters, making them
unideal for online learning. This work introduces methods based on the
generate-and-test approach to learn the agent state. A generate-and-test
algorithm searches for state features by generating features and testing their
usefulness. In this process, features useful for the agent&#x27;s performance on the
task are preserved, and the least useful features get replaced with newly
generated features. We study the effectiveness of our methods on two online
multi-step prediction problems. The first problem, trace conditioning, focuses
on the agent&#x27;s ability to remember a cue for a prediction multiple steps into
the future. In the second problem, trace patterning, the agent needs to learn
patterns in the observation signals and remember them for future predictions.
We show that our proposed methods can effectively learn the agent state online
and produce accurate predictions.</span>

                    <span>Improvements in computational and experimental capabilities are rapidly
increasing the amount of scientific data that is routinely generated. In
applications that are constrained by memory and computational intensity,
excessively large datasets may hinder scientific discovery, making data
reduction a critical component of data-driven methods. Datasets are growing in
two directions: the number of data points and their dimensionality. Whereas
data compression techniques are concerned with reducing dimensionality, the
focus here is on reducing the number of data points. A strategy is proposed to
select data points such that they uniformly span the phase-space of the data.
The algorithm proposed relies on estimating the probability map of the data and
using it to construct an acceptance probability. An iterative method is used to
accurately estimate the probability of the rare data points when only a small
subset of the dataset is used to construct the probability map. Instead of
binning the phase-space to estimate the probability map, its functional form is
approximated with a normalizing flow. Therefore, the method naturally extends
to high-dimensional datasets. The proposed framework is demonstrated as a
viable pathway to enable data-efficient machine learning when abundant data is
available. An implementation of the method is available in a companion
repository (https://github.com/NREL/Phase-space-sampling).</span>

                    <span>Triangular flows, also known as Kn\&quot;{o}the-Rosenblatt measure couplings,
comprise an important building block of normalizing flow models for generative
modeling and density estimation, including popular autoregressive flow models
such as real-valued non-volume preserving transformation models (Real NVP). We
present statistical guarantees and sample complexity bounds for triangular flow
statistical models. In particular, we establish the statistical consistency and
the finite sample convergence rates of the Kullback-Leibler estimator of the
Kn\&quot;{o}the-Rosenblatt measure coupling using tools from empirical process
theory. Our results highlight the anisotropic geometry of function classes at
play in triangular flows, shed light on optimal coordinate ordering, and lead
to statistical guarantees for Jacobian flows. We conduct numerical experiments
on synthetic data to illustrate the practical implications of our theoretical
findings.</span>

collection of ten datasets dedicated to developing models and training
strategies which are robust to domain shifts. Several experiments yield a
couple of critical observations which we believe are of general interest for
any future work on WILDS. Our study focuses on two datasets: iWildCam and FMoW.
We show that (1) Conducting separate cross-validation for each evaluation
metric is crucial for both datasets, (2) A weak correlation between validation
and test performance might make model development difficult for iWildCam, (3)
Minor changes in the training of hyper-parameters improve the baseline by a
relatively large margin (mainly on FMoW), (4) There is a strong correlation
between certain domains and certain target labels (mainly on iWildCam). To the
best of our knowledge, no prior work on these datasets has reported these
observations despite their obvious importance. Our code is public.</span>

                    <span>Kidney DCE-MRI aims at both qualitative assessment of kidney anatomy and
quantitative assessment of kidney function by estimating the tracer kinetic
(TK) model parameters. Accurate estimation of TK model parameters requires an
accurate measurement of the arterial input function (AIF) with high temporal
resolution. Accelerated imaging is used to achieve high temporal resolution,
which yields under-sampling artifacts in the reconstructed images. Compressed
sensing (CS) methods offer a variety of reconstruction options. Most commonly,
sparsity of temporal differences is encouraged for regularization to reduce
artifacts. Increasing regularization in CS methods removes the ambient
artifacts but also over-smooths the signal temporally which reduces the
parameter estimation accuracy. In this work, we propose a single image trained
deep neural network to reduce MRI under-sampling artifacts without reducing the
accuracy of functional imaging markers. Instead of regularizing with a penalty
term in optimization, we promote regularization by generating images from a
lower dimensional representation. In this manuscript we motivate and explain
the lower dimensional input design. We compare our approach to CS
reconstructions with multiple regularization weights. Proposed approach results
in kidney biomarkers that are highly correlated with the ground truth markers
estimated using the CS reconstruction which was optimized for functional
analysis. At the same time, the proposed approach reduces the artifacts in the
reconstructed images.</span>

evaluating distances of datapoints with a subset of the cluster centres. Our
contribution is substantially more efficient than k-means as it does not
require an all to all comparison of data points and clusters. We show that the
optimal solutions of our approximation are the same as in the exact solution.
However, our approach is considerably more efficient at extracting these
clusters compared to the state-of-the-art. We compare our approximation with
the exact k-means and alternative approximation approaches on a series of

                    <span>We propose a novel and effective purification based adversarial defense
method against pre-processor blind white- and black-box attacks. Our method is
computationally efficient and trained only with self-supervised learning on
general images, without requiring any adversarial training or retraining of the
classification model. We first show an empirical analysis on the adversarial
noise, defined to be the residual between an original image and its adversarial
example, has almost zero mean, symmetric distribution. Based on this
observation, we propose a very simple iterative Gaussian Smoothing (GS) which
can effectively smooth out adversarial noise and achieve substantially high
robust accuracy. To further improve it, we propose Neural Contextual Iterative
Smoothing (NCIS), which trains a blind-spot network (BSN) in a self-supervised
manner to reconstruct the discriminative features of the original image that is
also smoothed out by GS. From our extensive experiments on the large-scale
ImageNet using four classification models, we show that our method achieves
both competitive standard accuracy and state-of-the-art robust accuracy against
most strong purifier-blind white- and black-box attacks. Also, we propose a new
benchmark for evaluating a purification method based on commercial image
classification APIs, such as AWS, Azure, Clarifai and Google. We generate
adversarial examples by ensemble transfer-based black-box attack, which can
induce complete misclassification of APIs, and demonstrate that our method can
be used to increase adversarial robustness of APIs.</span>

                    <span>We present an objective function for similarity based hierarchical clustering
of partially ordered data that preserves the partial order. That is, if $x \le
y$, and if $[x]$ and $[y]$ are the respective clusters of $x$ and $y$, then
there is an order relation $\le&#x27;$ on the clusters for which $[x] \le&#x27; |y]$. The
theory distinguishes itself from existing theories for clustering of ordered
data in that the order relation and the similarity are combined into a
bi-objective optimisation problem to obtain a hierarchical clustering seeking
to satisfy both. In particular, the order relation is weighted in the range
$[0,1]$, and if the similarity and the order relation are not aligned, then
order preservation may have to yield in favor of clustering. Finding an optimal
solution is NP-hard, so we provide a polynomial time approximation algorithm,
with a relative performance guarantee of $O\!\left(\log^{3/2} \!\!\, n
\right)$, based on successive applications of directed sparsest cut. We provide
a demonstration on a benchmark dataset, showing that our method outperforms
existing methods for order preserving hierarchical clustering with significant
margin. The theory is an extension of the Dasgupta cost function for divisive
hierarchical clustering.</span>

                    <span>A recent line of research on deep learning focuses on the extremely
over-parameterized setting, and shows that when the network width is larger
than a high degree polynomial of the training sample size $n$ and the inverse
of the target error $\epsilon^{-1}$, deep neural networks learned by
(stochastic) gradient descent enjoy nice optimization and generalization
guarantees. Very recently, it is shown that under certain margin assumptions on
the training data, a polylogarithmic width condition suffices for two-layer
ReLU networks to converge and generalize (Ji and Telgarsky, 2019). However,
whether deep neural networks can be learned with such a mild
over-parameterization is still an open question. In this work, we answer this
question affirmatively and establish sharper learning guarantees for deep ReLU
networks trained by (stochastic) gradient descent. In specific, under certain
assumptions made in previous work, our optimization and generalization
guarantees hold with network width polylogarithmic in $n$ and $\epsilon^{-1}$.
Our results push the study of over-parameterized deep neural networks towards
more practical settings.</span>

                    <span>Hierarchical forecasting with intermittent time series is a challenge in both
research and empirical studies. Extensive research focuses on improving the
accuracy of each hierarchy, especially the intermittent time series at bottom
levels. Then hierarchical reconciliation could be used to improve the overall
performance further. In this paper, we present a
\emph{hierarchical-forecasting-with-alignment} approach that treats the bottom
level forecasts as mutable to ensure higher forecasting accuracy on the upper
levels of the hierarchy. We employ a pure deep learning forecasting approach
N-BEATS for continuous time series at the top levels and a widely used
tree-based algorithm LightGBM for the intermittent time series at the bottom
level. The \emph{hierarchical-forecasting-with-alignment} approach is a simple
yet effective variant of the bottom-up method, accounting for biases that are
difficult to observe at the bottom level. It allows suboptimal forecasts at the
lower level to retain a higher overall performance. The approach in this
empirical study was developed by the first author during the M5 Forecasting
Accuracy competition, ranking second place. The method is also business
orientated and could benefit for business strategic planning.</span>

                    <span>This paper analyzes a two-timescale stochastic algorithm framework for
bilevel optimization. Bilevel optimization is a class of problems which exhibit
a two-level structure, and its goal is to minimize an outer objective function
with variables which are constrained to be the optimal solution to an (inner)
optimization problem. We consider the case when the inner problem is
unconstrained and strongly convex, while the outer problem is constrained and
has a smooth objective function. We propose a two-timescale stochastic
approximation (TTSA) algorithm for tackling such a bilevel problem. In the
algorithm, a stochastic gradient update with a larger step size is used for the
inner problem, while a projected stochastic gradient update with a smaller step
size is used for the outer problem. We analyze the convergence rates for the
TTSA algorithm under various settings: when the outer problem is strongly
convex (resp.~weakly convex), the TTSA algorithm finds an
$\mathcal{O}(K^{-2/3})$-optimal (resp.~$\mathcal{O}(K^{-2/5})$-stationary)
solution, where $K$ is the total iteration number. As an application, we show
that a two-timescale natural actor-critic proximal policy optimization
algorithm can be viewed as a special case of our TTSA framework. Importantly,
the natural actor-critic algorithm is shown to converge at a rate of
$\mathcal{O}(K^{-1/4})$ in terms of the gap in expected discounted reward
compared to a global optimal policy.</span>

                    <span>Adversarial training is so far the most effective strategy in defending
against adversarial examples. However, it suffers from high computational costs
due to the iterative adversarial attacks in each training step. Recent studies
show that it is possible to achieve fast Adversarial Training by performing a
single-step attack with random initialization. However, such an approach still
lags behind state-of-the-art adversarial training algorithms on both stability
and model robustness. In this work, we develop a new understanding towards Fast
Adversarial Training, by viewing random initialization as performing randomized
smoothing for better optimization of the inner maximization problem. Following
this new perspective, we also propose a new initialization strategy, backward
smoothing, to further improve the stability and model robustness over
single-step robust training methods. Experiments on multiple benchmarks
demonstrate that our method achieves similar model robustness as the original
TRADES method while using much less training time ($\sim$3x improvement with
the same training schedule).</span>

                    <span>Pre-trained language models have been successful on text classification
tasks, but are prone to learning spurious correlations from biased datasets,
and are thus vulnerable when making inferences in a new domain. Prior work
reveals such spurious patterns via post-hoc explanation algorithms which
compute the importance of input features. Further, the model is regularized to
align the importance scores with human knowledge, so that the unintended model
behaviors are eliminated. However, such a regularization technique lacks
flexibility and coverage, since only importance scores towards a pre-defined
list of features are adjusted, while more complex human knowledge such as
feature interaction and pattern generalization can hardly be incorporated. In
this work, we propose to refine a learned language model for a target domain by
collecting human-provided compositional explanations regarding observed biases.
By parsing these explanations into executable logic rules, the human-specified
refinement advice from a small set of explanations can be generalized to more
training examples. We additionally introduce a regularization term allowing
adjustments for both importance and interaction of features to better rectify
model behavior. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach on
two text classification tasks by showing improved performance in target domain
as well as improved model fairness after refinement.</span>

                    <span>Deep neural networks (DNNs) are powerful tools for compressing and distilling
information. Due to their scale and complexity, often involving billions of
inter-dependent internal degrees of freedom, exact analysis approaches often
fall short. A common strategy in such cases is to identify slow degrees of
freedom that average out the erratic behavior of the underlying fast
microscopic variables. Here, we identify such a separation of scales occurring
in over-parameterized deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) at the end of
training. It implies that neuron pre-activations fluctuate in a nearly Gaussian
manner with a deterministic latent kernel. While for CNNs with infinitely many
channels these kernels are inert, for finite CNNs they adapt and learn from
data in an analytically tractable manner. The resulting thermodynamic theory of
deep learning yields accurate predictions on several deep non-linear CNN toy
models. In addition, it provides new ways of analyzing and understanding CNNs.</span>

                    <span>In this paper, we propose a dual-module network architecture that employs a
domain discriminative feature module to encourage the domain invariant feature
module to learn more domain invariant features. The proposed architecture can
be applied to any model that utilizes domain invariant features for
unsupervised domain adaptation to improve its ability to extract domain
invariant features. We conduct experiments with the Domain-Adversarial Training
of Neural Networks (DANN) model as a representative algorithm. In the training
process, we supply the same input to the two modules and then extract their
feature distribution and prediction results respectively. We propose a
discrepancy loss to find the discrepancy of the prediction results and the
feature distribution between the two modules. Through the adversarial training
by maximizing the loss of their feature distribution and minimizing the
discrepancy of their prediction results, the two modules are encouraged to
learn more domain discriminative and domain invariant features respectively.
Extensive comparative evaluations are conducted and the proposed approach
outperforms the state-of-the-art in most unsupervised domain adaptation tasks.</span>

of their underlying mechanisms continues to be an obstacle in adoption. To
instill confidence and trust in artificial intelligence systems, Explainable
Artificial Intelligence has emerged as a response to improving modern machine
learning algorithms&#x27; explainability. Inductive Logic Programming (ILP), a
subfield of symbolic artificial intelligence, plays a promising role in
generating interpretable explanations because of its intuitive logic-driven
framework. ILP effectively leverages abductive reasoning to generate
explainable first-order clausal theories from examples and background
knowledge. However, several challenges in developing methods inspired by ILP
need to be addressed for their successful application in practice. For example,
existing ILP systems often have a vast solution space, and the induced
solutions are very sensitive to noises and disturbances. This survey paper
summarizes the recent advances in ILP and a discussion of statistical
relational learning and neural-symbolic algorithms, which offer synergistic
views to ILP. Following a critical review of the recent advances, we delineate
observed challenges and highlight potential avenues of further ILP-motivated
research toward developing self-explanatory artificial intelligence systems.</span>

                    <span>Before researchers rush to reason across all available data or try complex
methods, perhaps it is prudent to first check for simpler alternatives.
Specifically, if the historical data has the most information in some small
region, then perhaps a model learned from that region would suffice for the
rest of the project.

To support this claim, we offer a case study with 240 GitHub projects, where
we find that the information in those projects &quot;clumped&quot; towards the earliest
parts of the project. A defect prediction model learned from just the first 150
commits works as well, or better than state-of-the-art alternatives. Using just
this early life cycle data, we can build models very quickly, very early in the
software project life cycle. Moreover, using this method, we have shown that a
simple model (with just two features) generalizes to hundreds of software
projects.

Based on this experience, we doubt that prior work on generalizing software
engineering defect prediction models may have needlessly complicated an
inherently simple process. Further, prior work that focused on later-life cycle
data needs to be revisited since their conclusions were drawn from relatively
uninformative regions.

                    <span>Extrapolating beyond-demonstrator (BD) performance through the imitation
learning (IL) algorithm aims to learn from and outperform the demonstrator.
Most existing BDIL algorithms are performed in two stages by first inferring a
reward function before learning a policy via reinforcement learning (RL).
However, such two-stage BDIL algorithms suffer from high computational
complexity, weak robustness, and large performance variations. In particular, a
poor reward function derived in the first stage will inevitably incur severe
performance loss in the second stage. In this work, we propose a hybrid
adversarial imitation learning (HAIL) algorithm that is one-stage, model-free,
generative-adversarial (GA) fashion and curiosity-driven. Thanks to the
one-stage design, the HAIL can integrate both the reward function learning and
the policy optimization into one procedure, which leads to many advantages such
as low computational complexity, high robustness, and strong adaptability. More
specifically, HAIL simultaneously imitates the demonstrator and explores BD
performance by utilizing hybrid rewards. Extensive simulation results confirm
that HAIL can achieve higher performance as compared to other similar BDIL
algorithms.</span>

                    <span>Multinomial Logit (MNL) is one of the most popular discrete choice models and
has been widely used to model ranking data. However, there is a long-standing
technical challenge of learning MNL from many real-world ranking data: exact
calculation of the MNL likelihood of \emph{partial rankings} is generally
intractable. In this work, we develop a scalable method for approximating the
MNL likelihood of general partial rankings in polynomial time complexity. We
also extend the proposed method to learn mixture of MNL. We demonstrate that
the proposed methods are particularly helpful for applications to choice-based
network formation modeling, where the formation of new edges in a network is
viewed as individuals making choices of their friends over a candidate set. The
problem of learning mixture of MNL models from partial rankings naturally
arises in such applications. And the proposed methods can be used to learn MNL
models from network data without the strong assumption that temporal orders of
all the edge formation are available. We conduct experiments on both synthetic
and real-world network data to demonstrate that the proposed methods achieve
more accurate parameter estimation and better fitness of data compared to
conventional methods.</span>

Also, we present an efficient algorithm to convert a given graph to a practical

                    <span>A time series represents a set of observations collected over time.
Typically, these observations are captured with a uniform sampling frequency
(e.g. daily). When data points are observed in uneven time intervals the time
series is referred to as irregular or intermittent. In such scenarios, the most
common solution is to reconstruct the time series to make it regular, thus
removing its intermittency. We hypothesise that, in irregular time series, the
time at which each observation is collected may be helpful to summarise the
dynamics of the data and improve forecasting performance. We study this idea by
developing a novel automatic feature engineering framework, which focuses on
extracting information from this point of view, i.e., when each instance is
collected. We study how valuable this information is by integrating it in a
time series forecasting workflow and investigate how it compares to or
complements state-of-the-art methods for regular time series forecasting. In
the end, we contribute by providing a novel framework that tackles feature
engineering for time series from an angle previously vastly ignored. We show
that our approach has the potential to further extract more information about
time series that significantly improves forecasting performance.</span>

                    <span>Predicting human motion from historical pose sequence is crucial for a
machine to succeed in intelligent interactions with humans. One aspect that has
been obviated so far, is the fact that how we represent the skeletal pose has a
critical impact on the prediction results. Yet there is no effort that
investigates across different pose representation schemes. We conduct an
indepth study on various pose representations with a focus on their effects on
the motion prediction task. Moreover, recent approaches build upon
off-the-shelf RNN units for motion prediction. These approaches process input
pose sequence sequentially and inherently have difficulties in capturing
long-term dependencies. In this paper, we propose a novel RNN architecture
termed AHMR (Attentive Hierarchical Motion Recurrent network) for motion
prediction which simultaneously models local motion contexts and a global
context. We further explore a geodesic loss and a forward kinematics loss for
the motion prediction task, which have more geometric significance than the
widely employed L2 loss. Interestingly, we applied our method to a range of
articulate objects including human, fish, and mouse. Empirical results show
that our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in short-term
prediction and achieves much enhanced long-term prediction proficiency, such as
retaining natural human-like motions over 50 seconds predictions. Our codes are
released.</span>

                    <span>To approach different business objectives, online traffic shaping algorithms
aim at improving exposures of a target set of items, such as boosting the
growth of new commodities. Generally, these algorithms assume that the utility
of each user-item pair can be accessed via a well-trained conversion rate
prediction model. However, for real E-Commerce platforms, there are unavoidable
factors preventing us from learning such an accurate model. In order to break
the heavy dependence on accurate inputs of the utility, we propose a general
online traffic shaping protocol for online E-Commerce applications. In our
framework, we approximate the function mapping the bonus scores, which
generally are the only method to influence the ranking result in the traffic
shaping problem, to the numbers of exposures and purchases. Concretely, we
approximate the above function by a class of the piece-wise linear function
constructed on the convex hull of the explored data points. Moreover, we
reformulate the online traffic shaping problem as linear programming where
these piece-wise linear functions are embedded into both the objective and
constraints. Our algorithm can straightforwardly optimize the linear
programming in the prime space, and its solution can be simply applied by a
stochastic strategy to fulfill the optimized objective and the constraints in
expectation. Finally, the online A/B test shows our proposed algorithm steadily
outperforms the previous industrial level traffic shaping algorithm.</span>

                    <span>Objective: The paper focuses on development of robust and accurate processing
solutions for continuous and cuff-less blood pressure (BP) monitoring. In this
regard, a robust deep learning-based framework is proposed for computation of
low latency, continuous, and calibration-free upper and lower bounds on the
systolic and diastolic BP. Method: Referred to as the BP-Net, the proposed
framework is a novel convolutional architecture that provides longer effective
memory while achieving superior performance due to incorporation of casual
dialated convolutions and residual connections. To utilize the real potential
of deep learning in extraction of intrinsic features (deep features) and
enhance the long-term robustness, the BP-Net uses raw Electrocardiograph (ECG)
and Photoplethysmograph (PPG) signals without extraction of any form of
hand-crafted features as it is common in existing solutions. Results: By
capitalizing on the fact that datasets used in recent literature are not
unified and properly defined, a benchmark dataset is constructed from the
MIMIC-I and MIMIC-III databases obtained from PhysioNet. The proposed BP-Net is
evaluated based on this benchmark dataset demonstrating promising performance
and shows superior generalizable capacity. Conclusion: The proposed BP-Net
architecture is more accurate than canonical recurrent networks and enhances
the long-term robustness of the BP estimation task. Significance: The proposed
BP-Net architecture addresses key drawbacks of existing BP estimation
solutions, i.e., relying heavily on extraction of hand-crafted features, such
as pulse arrival time (PAT), and; Lack of robustness. Finally, the constructed
BP-Net dataset provides a unified base for evaluation and comparison of deep
learning-based BP estimation algorithms.</span>

                    <span>Recently, hyperspectral imaging (HSI) has attracted increasing research
attention, especially for the ones based on a coded aperture snapshot spectral
imaging (CASSI) system. Existing deep HSI reconstruction models are generally
trained on paired data to retrieve original signals upon 2D compressed
measurements given by a particular optical hardware mask in CASSI, during which
the mask largely impacts the reconstruction performance and could work as a
&quot;model hyperparameter&quot; governing on data augmentations. This mask-specific
training style will lead to a hardware miscalibration issue, which sets up
barriers to deploying deep HSI models among different hardware and noisy
environments. To address this challenge, we introduce mask uncertainty for HSI
with a complete variational Bayesian learning treatment and explicitly model it
through a mask decomposition inspired by real hardware. Specifically, we
propose a novel Graph-based Self-Tuning (GST) network to reason uncertainties
adapting to varying spatial structures of masks among different hardware.
Moreover, we develop a bilevel optimization framework to balance HSI
reconstruction and uncertainty estimation, accounting for the hyperparameter
property of masks. Extensive experimental results and model discussions
validate the effectiveness (over 33/30 dB) of the proposed GST method under two
miscalibration scenarios and demonstrate a highly competitive performance
compared with the state-of-the-art well-calibrated methods. Our code and
pre-trained model are available at https://github.com/Jiamian

                    <span>Distributed Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) algorithms has
attracted a surge of interest lately mainly due to the recent advancements of
Deep Neural Networks (DNNs). Conventional Model-Based (MB) or Model-Free (MF)
RL algorithms are not directly applicable to the MARL problems due to
utilization of a fixed reward model for learning the underlying value function.
While DNN-based solutions perform utterly well when a single agent is involved,
such methods fail to fully generalize to the complexities of MARL problems. In
other words, although recently developed approaches based on DNNs for
multi-agent environments have achieved superior performance, they are still
prone to overfiting, high sensitivity to parameter selection, and sample
inefficiency. The paper proposes the Multi-Agent Adaptive Kalman Temporal
Difference (MAK-TD) framework and its Successor Representation-based variant,
referred to as the MAK-SR. Intuitively speaking, the main objective is to
capitalize on unique characteristics of Kalman Filtering (KF) such as
uncertainty modeling and online second order learning. The proposed MAK-TD/SR
frameworks consider the continuous nature of the action-space that is
associated with high dimensional multi-agent environments and exploit Kalman
Temporal Difference (KTD) to address the parameter uncertainty. By leveraging
the KTD framework, SR learning procedure is modeled into a filtering problem,
where Radial Basis Function (RBF) estimators are used to encode the continuous
space into feature vectors. On the other hand, for learning localized reward
functions, we resort to Multiple Model Adaptive Estimation (MMAE), to deal with
the lack of prior knowledge on the observation noise covariance and observation
mapping function. The proposed MAK-TD/SR frameworks are evaluated via several
experiments, which are implemented through the OpenAI Gym MARL benchmarks.</span>

                    <span>In dynamic programming (DP) and reinforcement learning (RL), an agent learns
to act optimally in terms of expected long-term return by sequentially
interacting with its environment modeled by a Markov decision process (MDP).
More generally in distributional reinforcement learning (DRL), the focus is on
the whole distribution of the return, not just its expectation. Although
DRL-based methods produced state-of-the-art performance in RL with function
approximation, they involve additional quantities (compared to the
non-distributional setting) that are still not well understood. As a first
contribution, we introduce a new class of distributional operators, together
with a practical DP algorithm for policy evaluation, that come with a robust
MDP interpretation. Indeed, our approach reformulates through an augmented
state space where each state is split into a worst-case substate and a
best-case substate, whose values are maximized by safe and risky policies
respectively. Finally, we derive distributional operators and DP algorithms
solving a new control task: How to distinguish safe from risky optimal actions
in order to break ties in the space of optimal policies?</span>

bottom-up design of neural networks (NN) with detailed interpretability, where

problems can be solved using NN model with few parameters. Furthermore, we
introduce the Self Reward Design (SRD), inspired by the Inverse Reward Design,
so that our interpretable design can (1) solve the problem by pure design

                    <span>In this paper, we consider the distributed optimization problem where $n$
agents, each possessing a local cost function, collaboratively minimize the
average of the local cost functions over a connected network. To solve the
problem, we propose a distributed random reshuffling (D-RR) algorithm that
combines the classical distributed gradient descent (DGD) method and Random
Reshuffling (RR). We show that D-RR inherits the superiority of RR for both
smooth strongly convex and smooth nonconvex objective functions. In particular,
for smooth strongly convex objective functions, D-RR achieves
$\mathcal{O}(1/T^2)$ rate of convergence (here, $T$ counts the total number of
iterations) in terms of the squared distance between the iterate and the unique
minimizer. When the objective function is assumed to be smooth nonconvex and
has Lipschitz continuous component functions, we show that D-RR drives the
squared norm of gradient to $0$ at a rate of $\mathcal{O}(1/T^{2/3})$. These
convergence results match those of centralized RR (up to constant factors).</span>

                    <span>Web-based interactions can be frequently represented by an attributed graph,
and node clustering in such graphs has received much attention lately. Multiple
efforts have successfully applied Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN), though
with some limits on accuracy as GCNs have been shown to suffer from
over-smoothing issues. Though other methods (particularly those based on
Laplacian Smoothing) have reported better accuracy, a fundamental limitation of
all the work is a lack of scalability. This paper addresses this open problem
by relating the Laplacian smoothing to the Generalized PageRank and applying a
random-walk based algorithm as a scalable graph filter. This forms the basis
for our scalable deep clustering algorithm, RwSL, where through a
self-supervised mini-batch training mechanism, we simultaneously optimize a
deep neural network for sample-cluster assignment distribution and an
autoencoder for a clustering-oriented embedding. Using 6 real-world datasets
and 6 clustering metrics, we show that RwSL achieved improved results over
several recent baselines. Most notably, we show that RwSL, unlike all other
deep clustering frameworks, can continue to scale beyond graphs with more than
one million nodes, i.e., handle web-scale. We also demonstrate how RwSL could
perform node clustering on a graph with 1.8 billion edges using only a single
GPU.</span>

                    <span>Hyperdimensional Computing (HDC), also known as Vector-Symbolic Architectures
(VSA), is a promising framework for the development of cognitive architectures
and artificial intelligence systems, as well as for technical applications and
emerging neuromorphic and nanoscale hardware. HDC/VSA operate with
hypervectors, i.e., distributed vector representations of large fixed dimension
(usually &gt; 1000). One of the key ingredients of HDC/VSA are the methods for
encoding data of various types (from numeric scalars and vectors to graphs)
into hypervectors. In this paper, we propose an approach for the formation of
hypervectors of sequences that provides both an equivariance with respect to
the shift of sequences and preserves the similarity of sequences with identical
elements at nearby positions. Our methods represent the sequence elements by
compositional hypervectors and exploit permutations of hypervectors for
representing the order of sequence elements. We experimentally explored the
proposed representations using a diverse set of tasks with data in the form of
symbolic strings. Although our approach is feature-free as it forms the
hypervector of a sequence from the hypervectors of its symbols at their
positions, it demonstrated the performance on a par with the methods that apply
various features, such as subsequences. The proposed techniques were designed
for the HDC/VSA model known as Sparse Binary Distributed Representations.
However, they can be adapted to hypervectors in formats of other HDC/VSA
models, as well as for representing sequences of types other than symbolic
strings.</span>

                    <span>Human mobility data accumulated from Point-of-Interest (POI) check-ins
provides great opportunity for user behavior understanding. However, data
quality issues (e.g., geolocation information missing, unreal check-ins, data
sparsity) in real-life mobility data limit the effectiveness of existing
POI-oriented studies, e.g., POI recommendation and location prediction, when
applied to real applications. To this end, in this paper, we develop a model,
named Bi-STDDP, which can integrate bi-directional spatio-temporal dependence
and users&#x27; dynamic preferences, to identify the missing POI check-in where a
user has visited at a specific time. Specifically, we first utilize
bi-directional global spatial and local temporal information of POIs to capture
the complex dependence relationships. Then, target temporal pattern in
combination with user and POI information are fed into a multi-layer network to
capture users&#x27; dynamic preferences. Moreover, the dynamic preferences are
transformed into the same space as the dependence relationships to form the
final model. Finally, the proposed model is evaluated on three large-scale
real-world datasets and the results demonstrate significant improvements of our
model compared with state-of-the-art methods. Also, it is worth noting that the
proposed model can be naturally extended to address POI recommendation and
location prediction tasks with competitive performances.</span>

                    <span>Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is found to be a major concern among various
occupational therapists. The foremost challenge of this neurodevelopmental
disorder lies in the fact of analyzing and exploring various symptoms of the
children at their early stage of development. Such early identification could
prop up the therapists and clinicians to provide proper assistive support to
make the children lead an independent life. Facial expressions and emotions
perceived by the children could contribute to such early intervention of
autism. In this regard, the paper implements in identifying basic facial
expression and exploring their emotions upon a time variant factor. The
emotions are analyzed by incorporating the facial expression identified through
CNN using 68 landmark points plotted on the frontal face with a prediction
network formed by RNN known as RCNN-FER system. The paper adopts R-CNN to take
the advantage of increased accuracy and performance with decreased time
complexity in predicting emotion as a textual network analysis. The papers
proves better accuracy in identifying the emotion in autistic children when
compared over simple machine learning models built for such identifications

                    <span>Direct policy search serves as one of the workhorses in modern reinforcement
learning (RL), and its applications in continuous control tasks have recently
attracted increasing attention. In this work, we investigate the convergence
theory of policy gradient (PG) methods for learning the linear risk-sensitive
and robust controller. In particular, we develop PG methods that can be
implemented in a derivative-free fashion by sampling system trajectories, and
establish both global convergence and sample complexity results in the
solutions of two fundamental settings in risk-sensitive and robust control: the
finite-horizon linear exponential quadratic Gaussian, and the finite-horizon
linear-quadratic disturbance attenuation problems. As a by-product, our results
also provide the first sample complexity for the global convergence of PG
methods on solving zero-sum linear-quadratic dynamic games, a
nonconvex-nonconcave minimax optimization problem that serves as a baseline
setting in multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) with continuous spaces.
One feature of our algorithms is that during the learning phase, a certain
level of robustness/risk-sensitivity of the controller is preserved, which we
termed as the implicit regularization property, and is an essential requirement
in safety-critical control systems.</span>

                    <span>The analysis of long sequence data remains challenging in many real-world
applications. We propose a novel architecture, ChunkFormer, that improves the
existing Transformer framework to handle the challenges while dealing with long
time series. Original Transformer-based models adopt an attention mechanism to
discover global information along a sequence to leverage the contextual data.
Long sequential data traps local information such as seasonality and
fluctuations in short data sequences. In addition, the original Transformer
consumes more resources by carrying the entire attention matrix during the
training course. To overcome these challenges, ChunkFormer splits the long
sequences into smaller sequence chunks for the attention calculation,
progressively applying different chunk sizes in each stage. In this way, the
proposed model gradually learns both local and global information without
changing the total length of the input sequences. We have extensively tested
the effectiveness of this new architecture on different business domains and
have proved the advantage of such a model over the existing Transformer-based
models.</span>

                    <span>A/B testing, or online experiment is a standard business strategy to compare
a new product with an old one in pharmaceutical, technological, and traditional
industries. Major challenges arise in online experiments of two-sided
marketplace platforms (e.g., Uber) where there is only one unit that receives a
sequence of treatments over time. In those experiments, the treatment at a
given time impacts current outcome as well as future outcomes. The aim of this
paper is to introduce a reinforcement learning framework for carrying A/B
testing in these experiments, while characterizing the long-term treatment
effects. Our proposed testing procedure allows for sequential monitoring and
online updating. It is generally applicable to a variety of treatment designs
in different industries. In addition, we systematically investigate the
theoretical properties (e.g., size and power) of our testing procedure.
Finally, we apply our framework to both simulated data and a real-world data
example obtained from a technological company to illustrate its advantage over
the current practice. A Python implementation of our test is available at
https://github.com/callmespring/CausalRL.</span>

                    <span>Many payment platforms hold large-scale marketing campaigns, which allocate
incentives to encourage users to pay through their applications. To maximize
the return on investment, incentive allocations are commonly solved in a
two-stage procedure. After training a response estimation model to estimate the
users&#x27; mobile payment probabilities (MPP), a linear programming process is
applied to obtain the optimal incentive allocation. However, the large amount
of biased data in the training set, generated by the previous biased allocation
policy, causes a biased estimation. This bias deteriorates the performance of
the response model and misleads the linear programming process, dramatically
degrading the performance of the resulting allocation policy. To overcome this
obstacle, we propose a bias correction adversarial network. Our method
leverages the small set of unbiased data obtained under a full-randomized
allocation policy to train an unbiased model and then uses it to reduce the
bias with adversarial learning. Offline and online experimental results
demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches and
significantly improves the performance of the resulting allocation policy in a
real-world marketing campaign.</span>

                    <span>Information-theoretic measures have been widely adopted in the design of
features for learning and decision problems. Inspired by this, we look at the
relationship between i) a weak form of information loss in the Shannon sense
and ii) the operation loss in the minimum probability of error (MPE) sense when
considering a family of lossy continuous representations (features) of a
continuous observation. We present several results that shed light on this
interplay. Our first result offers a lower bound on a weak form of information
loss as a function of its respective operation loss when adopting a discrete
lossy representation (quantization) instead of the original raw observation.
From this, our main result shows that a specific form of vanishing information
loss (a weak notion of asymptotic informational sufficiency) implies a
vanishing MPE loss (or asymptotic operational sufficiency) when considering a
general family of lossy continuous representations. Our theoretical findings
support the observation that the selection of feature representations that
attempt to capture informational sufficiency is appropriate for learning, but
this selection is a rather conservative design principle if the intended goal
is achieving MPE in classification. Supporting this last point, and under some
structural conditions, we show that it is possible to adopt an alternative
notion of informational sufficiency (strictly weaker than pure sufficiency in
the mutual information sense) to achieve operational sufficiency in learning.</span>

                    <span>The displacement of two immiscible fluids is a common problem in fluid flow
in porous media. Such a problem can be posed as a partial differential equation
(PDE) in what is commonly referred to as a Buckley-Leverett (B-L) problem. The
B-L problem is a non-linear hyperbolic conservation law that is known to be
notoriously difficult to solve using traditional numerical methods. Here, we
address the forward hyperbolic B-L problem with a nonconvex flux function using
physics-informed neural networks (PINNs). The contributions of this paper are
twofold. First, we present a PINN approach to solve the hyperbolic B-L problem
by embedding the Oleinik entropy condition into the neural network residual. We
do not use a diffusion term (artificial viscosity) in the residual-loss, but we
rely on the strong form of the PDE. Second, we use the Adam optimizer with
residual-based adaptive refinement (RAR) algorithm to achieve an ultra-low loss
without weighting. Our solution method can accurately capture the shock-front
and produce an accurate overall solution. We report a L2 validation error of 2
x 10-2 and a L2 loss of 1x 10-6. The proposed method does not require any
additional regularization or weighting of losses to obtain such accurate
solution.</span>

                    <span>The recent success of deep learning applications has coincided with those
widely available powerful computational resources for training sophisticated
machine learning models with huge datasets. Nonetheless, training large models
such as convolutional neural networks using model parallelism (as opposed to
data parallelism) is challenging because the complex nature of communication
between model shards makes it difficult to partition the computation
efficiently across multiple machines with an acceptable trade-off. This paper
presents SplitBrain, a high performance distributed deep learning framework
supporting hybrid data and model parallelism. Specifically, SplitBrain provides
layer-specific partitioning that co-locates compute intensive convolutional
layers while sharding memory demanding layers. A novel scalable group
communication is proposed to further improve the training throughput with
reduced communication overhead. The results show that SplitBrain can achieve
nearly linear speedup while saving up to 67\% of memory consumption for data
and model parallel VGG over CIFAR-10.</span>

                    <span>Learning powerful representations is one central theme of graph neural
networks (GNNs). It requires refining the critical information from the input
graph, instead of the trivial patterns, to enrich the representations. Towards
this end, graph attention and pooling methods prevail. They mostly follow the
paradigm of &quot;learning to attend&quot;. It maximizes the mutual information between
the attended subgraph and the ground-truth label. However, this training
paradigm is prone to capture the spurious correlations between the trivial
subgraph and the label. Such spurious correlations are beneficial to
in-distribution (ID) test evaluations, but cause poor generalization in the
out-of-distribution (OOD) test data. In this work, we revisit the GNN modeling
from the causal perspective. On the top of our causal assumption, the trivial
information serves as a confounder between the critical information and the
label, which opens a backdoor path between them and makes them spuriously
correlated. Hence, we present a new paradigm of deconfounded training (DTP)
that better mitigates the confounding effect and latches on the critical
information, to enhance the representation and generalization ability.
Specifically, we adopt the attention modules to disentangle the critical
subgraph and trivial subgraph. Then we make each critical subgraph fairly
interact with diverse trivial subgraphs to achieve a stable prediction. It
allows GNNs to capture a more reliable subgraph whose relation with the label
is robust across different distributions. We conduct extensive experiments on
synthetic and real-world datasets to demonstrate the effectiveness.</span>

                    <span>Dance choreography for a piece of music is a challenging task, having to be
creative in presenting distinctive stylistic dance elements while taking into
account the musical theme and rhythm. It has been tackled by different
approaches such as similarity retrieval, sequence-to-sequence modeling and
generative adversarial networks, but their generated dance sequences are often
short of motion realism, diversity and music consistency. In this paper, we
propose a Music-to-Dance with Optimal Transport Network (MDOT-Net) for learning
to generate 3D dance choreographs from music. We introduce an optimal transport
distance for evaluating the authenticity of the generated dance distribution
and a Gromov-Wasserstein distance to measure the correspondence between the
dance distribution and the input music. This gives a well defined and
non-divergent training objective that mitigates the limitation of standard GAN
training which is frequently plagued with instability and divergent generator
loss issues. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our MDOT-Net can synthesize
realistic and diverse dances which achieve an organic unity with the input
music, reflecting the shared intentionality and matching the rhythmic
articulation.</span>

as they provide data-driven solutions to diverse real-world problems, thanks to
recent breakthroughs in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML).
However, machine learning meets software engineering not only with promising
potentials but also with some inherent challenges. Despite some recent research
efforts, we still do not have a clear understanding of the challenges of
developing ML-based applications and the current industry practices. Moreover,
it is unclear where software engineering researchers should focus their efforts
to better support ML application developers. In this paper, we report about a
survey that aimed to understand the challenges and best practices of ML
application development. We synthesize the results obtained from 80
practitioners (with diverse skills, experience, and application domains) into
17 findings; outlining challenges and best practices for ML application
development. Practitioners involved in the development of ML-based software
systems can leverage the summarized best practices to improve the quality of
their system. We hope that the reported challenges will inform the research

                    <span>Multi-class classification is one of the most common tasks in machine
learning applications, where data is labeled by one of many class labels. Many
loss functions have been proposed for multi-class classification including two
well-known ones, namely the cross-entropy (CE) loss and the crammer-singer (CS)
loss (aka. the SVM loss). While CS loss has been used widely for traditional
machine learning tasks, CE loss is usually a default choice for multi-class
deep learning tasks. There are also top-$k$ variants of CS loss and CE loss
that are proposed to promote the learning of a classifier for achieving better
top-$k$ accuracy. Nevertheless, it still remains unclear the relationship
between these different losses, which hinders our understanding of their
expectations in different scenarios. In this paper, we present a unified view
of the CS/CE losses and their smoothed top-$k$ variants by proposing a new
family of loss functions, which are arguably better than the CS/CE losses when
the given label information is incomplete and noisy. The new family of smooth
loss functions named {label-distributionally robust (LDR) loss} is defined by
leveraging the distributionally robust optimization (DRO) framework to model
the uncertainty in the given label information, where the uncertainty over true
class labels is captured by using distributional weights for each label
regularized by a function.</span>

                    <span>Accurate decoding of surface electromyography (sEMG) is pivotal for
muscle-to-machine-interfaces (MMI) and their application for e.g.
rehabilitation therapy. sEMG signals have high inter-subject variability, due
to various factors, including skin thickness, body fat percentage, and
electrode placement. Therefore, obtaining high generalization quality of a
trained sEMG decoder is quite challenging. Usually, machine learning based sEMG
decoders are either trained on subject-specific data, or at least recalibrated
for each user, individually. Even though, deep learning algorithms produced
several state of the art results for sEMG decoding,however, due to the limited
amount of availability of sEMG data, the deep learning models are prone to
overfitting. Recently, transfer learning for domain adaptation improved
generalization quality with reduced training time on various machine learning
tasks. In this study, we investigate the effectiveness of transfer learning
using weight initialization for recalibration of two different pretrained deep
learning models on a new subjects data, and compare their performance to
subject-specific models. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study
that thoroughly investigated weight-initialization based transfer learning for
sEMG classification and compared transfer learning to subject-specific
modeling. We tested our models on three publicly available databases under
various settings. On average over all settings, our transfer learning approach
improves 5~\%-points on the pretrained models without fine-tuning and
12~\%-points on the subject-specific models, while being trained on average
22~\% fewer epochs. Our results indicate that transfer learning enables faster
training on fewer samples than user-specific models, and improves the
performance of pretrained models as long as enough data is available.</span>

                    <span>Many prediction tasks of real-world applications need to model multi-order
feature interactions in user&#x27;s event sequence for better detection performance.
However, existing popular solutions usually suffer two key issues: 1) only
focusing on feature interactions and failing to capture the sequence influence;
2) only focusing on sequence information, but ignoring internal feature
relations of each event, thus failing to extract a better event representation.
In this paper, we consider a two-level structure for capturing the hierarchical
information over user&#x27;s event sequence: 1) learning effective feature
interactions based event representation; 2) modeling the sequence
representation of user&#x27;s historical events. Experimental results on both
industrial and public datasets clearly demonstrate that our model achieves
significantly better performance compared with state-of-the-art baselines.</span>

                    <span>Illegal vehicle parking is a common urban problem faced by major cities in
the world, as it incurs traffic jams, which lead to air pollution and traffic
accidents. The government highly relies on active human efforts to detect
illegal parking events. However, such an approach is extremely ineffective to
cover a large city since the police have to patrol over the entire city roads.

The massive and high-quality sharing bike trajectories from Mobike offer us a
unique opportunity to design a ubiquitous illegal parking detection approach,
as most of the illegal parking events happen at curbsides and have significant
impact on the bike users. The detection result can guide the patrol schedule,
i.e. send the patrol policemen to the region with higher illegal parking risks,
and further improve the patrol efficiency. Inspired by this idea, three main
components are employed in the proposed framework: 1)~{\em trajectory
pre-processing}, which filters outlier GPS points, performs map-matching, and
builds trajectory indexes; 2)~{\em illegal parking detection}, which models the
normal trajectories, extracts features from the evaluation trajectories, and
utilizes a distribution test-based method to discover the illegal parking
events; and 3)~{\em patrol scheduling}, which leverages the detection result as
reference context, and models the scheduling task as a multi-agent
reinforcement learning problem to guide the patrol police. Finally, extensive
experiments are presented to validate the effectiveness of illegal parking
detection, as well as the improvement of patrol efficiency.</span>

for the inclusion of anomalous objects and can create reproducible synthetic
environment and scenes for testing robustness. All of the datasets were created
for testing robustness and measuring progress in robustness. The datasets have
been used in various other works to measure their own progress in robustness
and allowing for tangential progress that does not focus exclusively on natural
accuracy.

Given these datasets, we created several novel methods that aim to advance
robustness research. We build off of simple baselines in the form of Maximum
Logit, and Typicality Score as well as create a novel data augmentation method
in the form of DeepAugment that improves on the aforementioned benchmarks.
Maximum Logit considers the logit values instead of the values after the
softmax operation, while a small change produces noticeable improvements. The
Typicality Score compares the output distribution to a posterior distribution
over classes. We show that this improves performance over the baseline in all
but the segmentation task. Speculating that perhaps at the pixel level the
semantic information of a pixel is less meaningful than that of class level
information. Finally the new augmentation technique of DeepAugment utilizes
neural networks to create augmentations on images that are radically different
than the traditional geometric and camera based transformations used
previously.</span>

                    <span>Recent advances in machine learning have largely benefited from the massive
accessible training data. However, large-scale data sharing has raised great
privacy concerns. In this work, we propose a novel privacy-preserving data
Generative model based on the PATE framework (G-PATE), aiming to train a
scalable differentially private data generator that preserves high generated
data utility. Our approach leverages generative adversarial nets to generate
data, combined with private aggregation among different discriminators to
ensure strong privacy guarantees. Compared to existing approaches, G-PATE
significantly improves the use of privacy budgets. In particular, we train a
student data generator with an ensemble of teacher discriminators and propose a
novel private gradient aggregation mechanism to ensure differential privacy on
all information that flows from teacher discriminators to the student
generator. In addition, with random projection and gradient discretization, the
proposed gradient aggregation mechanism is able to effectively deal with
high-dimensional gradient vectors. Theoretically, we prove that G-PATE ensures
differential privacy for the data generator. Empirically, we demonstrate the
superiority of G-PATE over prior work through extensive experiments. We show
that G-PATE is the first work being able to generate high-dimensional image
data with high data utility under limited privacy budgets ($\epsilon \le 1$).

                    <span>This work is focused on the pruning of some convolutional neural networks
(CNNs) and improving theirs efficiency on graphic processing units (GPU) by
using a direct sparse algorithm. The Nvidia deep neural network (cuDnn) library
is the most effective implementations of deep learning (DL) algorithms for
GPUs. GPUs are the most commonly used accelerators for deep learning
computations. One of the most common techniques for improving the efficiency of
CNN models is weight pruning and quantization. There are two main types of
pruning: structural and non-structural. The first enables much easier
acceleration on many type of accelerators, but with this type it is difficult
to achieve a sparsity level and accuracy as high as that obtained with the
second type. Non-structural pruning with retraining can generate a weight
tensors up to 90% or more of sparsity in some deep CNN models. In this article
the pruning algorithm is presented which makes it possible to achieve high
sparsity levels without accuracy drop. In the next stage the linear and
non-linear quantization is adapted for further time and footprint reduction.
This paper is an extended of previously published paper concerning effective
pruning techniques and present real models pruned with high sparsities and
reduced precision which can achieve better performance than the CuDnn library.</span>

                    <span>Approximate message passing (AMP) is a low-cost iterative
parameter-estimation technique for certain high-dimensional linear systems with
non-Gaussian distributions. However, AMP only applies to independent
identically distributed (IID) transform matrices, but may become unreliable
(e.g., perform poorly or even diverge) for other matrix ensembles, especially
for ill-conditioned ones. Orthogonal/vector AMP (OAMP/VAMP) was proposed for
general right-unitarily-invariant matrices to handle this difficulty. However,
the Bayes-optimal OAMP/VAMP (BO-OAMP/VAMP) requires a high-complexity linear
minimum mean square error (MMSE) estimator. This limits the application of
OAMP/VAMP to large-scale systems.

To solve the disadvantages of AMP and BO-OAMP/VAMP, this paper proposes a
memory AMP (MAMP) framework under an orthogonality principle, which guarantees
the asymptotic IID Gaussianity of estimation errors in MAMP. We present an
orthogonalization procedure for the local memory estimators to realize the
required orthogonality for MAMP. Furthermore, we propose a Bayes-optimal MAMP
(BO-MAMP), in which a long-memory matched filter is proposed for interference
suppression. The complexity of BO-MAMP is comparable to AMP. A state evolution
is derived to asymptotically characterize the performance of BO-MAMP. Based on
state evolution, the relaxation parameters and damping vector in BO-MAMP are
optimized. For all right-unitarily-invariant matrices, the state evolution of
the optimized BO-MAMP converges to the same fixed point as that of the
high-complexity BO-OAMP/VAMP and is Bayes-optimal if its state evolution has a
unique fixed point. Finally, simulations are provided to verify the validity
and accuracy of the theoretical results.</span>

                    <span>We study reinforcement learning (RL) with linear function approximation.
Existing algorithms for this problem only have high-probability regret and/or
Probably Approximately Correct (PAC) sample complexity guarantees, which cannot
guarantee the convergence to the optimal policy. In this paper, in order to
overcome the limitation of existing algorithms, we propose a new algorithm
called FLUTE, which enjoys uniform-PAC convergence to the optimal policy with
high probability. The uniform-PAC guarantee is the strongest possible guarantee
for reinforcement learning in the literature, which can directly imply both PAC
and high probability regret bounds, making our algorithm superior to all
existing algorithms with linear function approximation. At the core of our
algorithm is a novel minimax value function estimator and a multi-level
partition scheme to select the training samples from historical observations.
Both of these techniques are new and of independent interest.</span>

                    <span>Long ties, the social ties that bridge different communities, are widely
believed to play crucial roles in spreading novel information in social
networks. However, some existing network theories and prediction models
indicate that long ties might dissolve quickly or eventually become redundant,
thus putting into question the long-term value of long ties. Our empirical
analysis of real-world dynamic networks shows that contrary to such reasoning,
long ties are more likely to persist than other social ties, and that many of
them constantly function as social bridges without being embedded in local
networks. Using a novel cost-benefit analysis model combined with machine
learning, we show that long ties are highly beneficial, which instinctively
motivates people to expend extra effort to maintain them. This partly explains
why long ties are more persistent than what has been suggested by many existing
theories and models. Overall, our study suggests the need for social
interventions that can promote the formation of long ties, such as mixing
people with diverse backgrounds.</span>

                    <span>In this work, we develop practical user scheduling algorithms for downlink
bursty traffic with emphasis on user fairness. In contrast to the conventional
scheduling algorithms that either equally divides the transmission time slots
among users or maximizing some ratios without physcial meanings, we propose to
use the 5%-tile user data rate (5TUDR) as the metric to evaluate user fairness.
Since it is difficult to directly optimize 5TUDR, we first cast the problem
into the stochastic game framework and subsequently propose a Multi-Agent
Reinforcement Learning (MARL)-based algorithm to perform distributed
optimization on the resource block group (RBG) allocation. Furthermore, each
MARL agent is designed to take information measured by network counters from
multiple network layers (e.g. Channel Quality Indicator, Buffer size) as the
input states while the RBG allocation as action with a proposed reward function
designed to maximize 5TUDR. Extensive simulation is performed to show that the
proposed MARL-based scheduler can achieve fair scheduling while maintaining
good average network throughput as compared to conventional schedulers.</span>

                    <span>Graphs can model complicated interactions between entities, which naturally
emerge in many important applications. These applications can often be cast
into standard graph learning tasks, in which a crucial step is to learn
low-dimensional graph representations. Graph neural networks (GNNs) are
currently the most popular model in graph embedding approaches. However,
standard GNNs in the neighborhood aggregation paradigm suffer from limited
discriminative power in distinguishing \emph{high-order} graph structures as
opposed to \emph{low-order} structures. To capture high-order structures,
researchers have resorted to motifs and developed motif-based GNNs. However,
existing motif-based GNNs still often suffer from less discriminative power on
high-order structures. To overcome the above limitations, we propose Motif
Graph Neural Network (MGNN), a novel framework to better capture high-order
structures, hinging on our proposed motif redundancy minimization operator and
injective motif combination. First, MGNN produces a set of node representations
w.r.t. each motif. The next phase is our proposed redundancy minimization among
motifs which compares the motifs with each other and distills the features
unique to each motif. Finally, MGNN performs the updating of node
representations by combining multiple representations from different motifs. In
particular, to enhance the discriminative power, MGNN utilizes an injective
function to combine the representations w.r.t. different motifs. We further
show that our proposed architecture increases the expressive power of GNNs with
a theoretical analysis. We demonstrate that MGNN outperforms state-of-the-art
methods on seven public benchmarks on both node classification and graph
classification tasks.</span>

                    <span>Recently, Vision Transformer (ViT) has continuously established new
milestones in the computer vision field, while the high computation and memory
cost makes its propagation in industrial production difficult. Pruning, a
traditional model compression paradigm for hardware efficiency, has been widely
applied in various DNN structures. Nevertheless, it stays ambiguous on how to
perform exclusive pruning on the ViT structure. Considering three key points:
the structural characteristics, the internal data pattern of ViTs, and the
related edge device deployment, we leverage the input token sparsity and
propose a computation-aware soft pruning framework, which can be set up on
vanilla Transformers of both flatten and CNN-type structures, such as
Pooling-based ViT (PiT). More concretely, we design a dynamic attention-based
multi-head token selector, which is a lightweight module for adaptive
instance-wise token selection. We further introduce a soft pruning technique,
which integrates the less informative tokens generated by the selector module
into a package token that will participate in subsequent calculations rather
than being completely discarded. Our framework is bound to the trade-off
between accuracy and computation constraints of specific edge devices through
our proposed computation-aware training strategy. Experimental results show
that our framework significantly reduces the computation cost of ViTs while
maintaining comparable performance on image classification. Moreover, our
framework can guarantee the identified model to meet resource specifications of
mobile devices and FPGA, and even achieve the real-time execution of DeiT-T on
mobile platforms. For example, our method reduces the latency of DeiT-T to 26
ms (26%$\sim $41% superior to existing works) on the mobile device with
0.25%$\sim $4% higher top-1 accuracy on ImageNet. Our code will be released
soon.</span>

                    <span>Large scale datasets created from crowdsourced labels or openly available
data have become crucial to provide training data for large scale learning
algorithms. While these datasets are easier to acquire, the data are frequently
noisy and unreliable, which is motivating research on weakly supervised
learning techniques. In this paper we propose original ideas that help us to
leverage such datasets in the context of change detection. First, we propose
the guided anisotropic diffusion (GAD) algorithm, which improves semantic
segmentation results using the input images as guides to perform edge
preserving filtering. We then show its potential in two weakly-supervised
learning strategies tailored for change detection. The first strategy is an
iterative learning method that combines model optimisation and data cleansing
using GAD to extract the useful information from a large scale change detection
dataset generated from open vector data. The second one incorporates GAD within
a novel spatial attention layer that increases the accuracy of weakly
supervised networks trained to perform pixel-level predictions from image-level
labels. Improvements with respect to state-of-the-art are demonstrated on 4
different public datasets.</span>

                    <span>K-core decomposition is a commonly used metric to analyze graph structure or
study the relative importance of nodes in complex graphs. Recent years have
seen rapid growth in the scale of the graph, especially in industrial settings.
For example, our industrial partner runs popular social applications with
billions of users and is able to gather a rich set of user data. As a result,
applying K-core decomposition on large graphs has attracted more and more
attention from academics and the industry. A simple but effective method to
deal with large graphs is to train them in the distributed settings, and some
distributed K-core decomposition algorithms are also proposed. Despite their
effectiveness, we experimentally and theoretically observe that these
algorithms consume too many resources and become unstable on super-large-scale
graphs, especially when the given resources are limited. In this paper, we deal
with those super-large-scale graphs and propose a divide-and-conquer strategy
on top of the distributed K-core decomposition algorithm. We evaluate our
approach on three large graphs. The experimental results show that the
consumption of resources can be significantly reduced, and the calculation on
large-scale graphs becomes more stable than the existing methods. For example,
the distributed K-core decomposition algorithm can scale to a large graph with
136 billion edges without losing correctness with our divide-and-conquer
technique.</span>

                    <span>Could we automatically derive the score of a piano accompaniment based on the
audio of a pop song? This is the audio-to-symbolic arrangement problem we
tackle in this paper. A good arrangement model should not only consider the
audio content but also have prior knowledge of piano composition (so that the
generation &quot;sounds like&quot; the audio and meanwhile maintains musicality.) To this
end, we contribute a cross-modal representation-learning model, which 1)
extracts chord and melodic information from the audio, and 2) learns texture
representation from both audio and a corrupted ground truth arrangement. We
further introduce a tailored training strategy that gradually shifts the source
of texture information from corrupted score to audio. In the end, the
score-based texture posterior is reduced to a standard normal distribution, and
only audio is needed for inference. Experiments show that our model captures
major audio information and outperforms baselines in generation quality.</span>

                    <span>Objective: To determine if a realistic, but computationally efficient model
of the electrocardiogram can be used to pre-train a deep neural network (DNN)
with a wide range of morphologies and abnormalities specific to a given
condition - T-wave Alternans (TWA) as a result of Post-Traumatic Stress
Disorder, or PTSD - and significantly boost performance on a small database of
rare individuals.

Approach: Using a previously validated artificial ECG model, we generated
180,000 artificial ECGs with or without significant TWA, with varying heart
rate, breathing rate, TWA amplitude, and ECG morphology. A DNN, trained on over
70,000 patients to classify 25 different rhythms, was modified the output layer
to a binary class (TWA or no-TWA, or equivalently, PTSD or no-PTSD), and
transfer learning was performed on the artificial ECG. In a final transfer
learning step, the DNN was trained and cross-validated on ECG from 12 PTSD and
24 controls for all combinations of using the three databases.

Main results: The best performing approach (AUROC &#x3D; 0.77, Accuracy &#x3D; 0.72,
F1-score &#x3D; 0.64) was found by performing both transfer learning steps, using
the pre-trained arrhythmia DNN, the artificial data and the real PTSD-related
ECG data. Removing the artificial data from training led to the largest drop in
performance. Removing the arrhythmia data from training provided a modest, but
significant, drop in performance. The final model showed no significant drop in
performance on the artificial data, indicating no overfitting.

Significance: In healthcare, it is common to only have a small collection of
high-quality data and labels, or a larger database with much lower quality (and
less relevant) labels. The paradigm presented here, involving model-based
performance boosting, provides a solution through transfer learning on a large
realistic artificial database, and a partially relevant real database.</span>

                    <span>Designing manufacturing processes with high yield and strong reliability
relies on effective methods for rare event estimation. Genealogical importance
splitting reduces the variance of rare event probability estimators by
iteratively selecting and replicating realizations that are headed towards a
rare event. The replication step is difficult when applied to deterministic
systems where the initial conditions of the offspring realizations need to be
modified. Typically, a random perturbation is applied to the offspring to
differentiate their trajectory from the parent realization. However, this
random perturbation strategy may be effective for some systems while failing
for others, preventing variance reduction in the probability estimate. This
work seeks to address this limitation using a generative model such as a
Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) to generate perturbations that are
consistent with the attractor of the dynamical system. The proposed
GAN-assisted Importance SPlitting method (GANISP) improves the variance
reduction for the system targeted. An implementation of the method is available
in a companion repository (https://github.com/NREL/GANISP).</span>

                    <span>In the last decade, many deep learning models have been well trained and made
a great success in various fields of machine intelligence, especially for
computer vision and natural language processing. To better leverage the
potential of these well-trained models in intra-domain or cross-domain transfer
learning situations, knowledge distillation (KD) and domain adaptation (DA) are
proposed and become research highlights. They both aim to transfer useful
information from a well-trained model with original training data. However, the
original data is not always available in many cases due to privacy, copyright
or confidentiality. Recently, the data-free knowledge transfer paradigm has
attracted appealing attention as it deals with distilling valuable knowledge
from well-trained models without requiring to access to the training data. In
particular, it mainly consists of the data-free knowledge distillation (DFKD)
and source data-free domain adaptation (SFDA). On the one hand, DFKD aims to
transfer the intra-domain knowledge of original data from a cumbersome teacher
network to a compact student network for model compression and efficient
inference. On the other hand, the goal of SFDA is to reuse the cross-domain
knowledge stored in a well-trained source model and adapt it to a target
domain. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive survey on data-free knowledge
transfer from the perspectives of knowledge distillation and unsupervised
domain adaptation, to help readers have a better understanding of the current
research status and ideas. Applications and challenges of the two areas are
briefly reviewed, respectively. Furthermore, we provide some insights to the
subject of future research.</span>

                    <span>6G will move mobile networks towards increasing levels of complexity. To deal
with this complexity, optimization of network parameters is key to ensure high
performance and timely adaptivity to dynamic network environments. The
optimization of the antenna tilt provides a practical and cost-efficient method
to improve coverage and capacity in the network. Previous methods based on
Reinforcement Learning (RL) have shown great promise for tilt optimization by
learning adaptive policies outperforming traditional tilt optimization methods.
However, most existing RL methods are based on single-cell features
representation, which fails to fully characterize the agent state, resulting in
suboptimal performance. Also, most of such methods lack scalability, due to
state-action explosion, and generalization ability. In this paper, we propose a
Graph Attention Q-learning (GAQ) algorithm for tilt optimization. GAQ relies on
a graph attention mechanism to select relevant neighbors information, improve
the agent state representation, and update the tilt control policy based on a
history of observations using a Deep Q-Network (DQN). We show that GAQ
efficiently captures important network information and outperforms standard DQN
with local information by a large margin. In addition, we demonstrate its
ability to generalize to network deployments of different sizes and densities.</span>

                    <span>Generative models can be trained to emulate complex empirical data, but are
they useful to make predictions in the context of previously unobserved
environments? An intuitive idea to promote such extrapolation capabilities is
to have the architecture of such model reflect a causal graph of the true data
generating process, such that one can intervene on each node independently of
the others. However, the nodes of this graph are usually unobserved, leading to
overparameterization and lack of identifiability of the causal structure. We
develop a theoretical framework to address this challenging situation by
defining a weaker form of identifiability, based on the principle of
independence of mechanisms. We demonstrate on toy examples that classical
stochastic gradient descent can hinder the model&#x27;s extrapolation capabilities,
suggesting independence of mechanisms should be enforced explicitly during
training. Experiments on deep generative models trained on real world data
support these insights and illustrate how the extrapolation capabilities of
such models can be leveraged.</span>

                    <span>We consider Bayesian optimization of the output of a network of functions,
where each function takes as input the output of its parent nodes, and where
the network takes significant time to evaluate. Such problems arise, for
example, in reinforcement learning, engineering design, and manufacturing.
While the standard Bayesian optimization approach observes only the final
output, our approach delivers greater query efficiency by leveraging
information that the former ignores: intermediate output within the network.
This is achieved by modeling the nodes of the network using Gaussian processes
and choosing the points to evaluate using, as our acquisition function, the
expected improvement computed with respect to the implied posterior on the
objective. Although the non-Gaussian nature of this posterior prevents
computing our acquisition function in closed form, we show that it can be
efficiently maximized via sample average approximation. In addition, we prove
that our method is asymptotically consistent, meaning that it finds a globally
optimal solution as the number of evaluations grows to infinity, thus
generalizing previously known convergence results for the expected improvement.
Notably, this holds even though our method might not evaluate the domain
densely, instead leveraging problem structure to leave regions unexplored.
Finally, we show that our approach dramatically outperforms standard Bayesian
optimization methods in several synthetic and real-world problems.</span>

                    <span>In recent years, gradient based Meta-RL (GMRL) methods have achieved
remarkable successes in either discovering effective online hyperparameter for
one single task (Xu et al., 2018) or learning good initialisation for
multi-task transfer learning (Finn et al., 2017). Despite the empirical
successes, it is often neglected that computing meta gradients via vanilla
backpropagation is ill-defined. In this paper, we argue that the stochastic
meta-gradient estimation adopted by many existing MGRL methods are in fact
biased; the bias comes from two sources: 1) the compositional bias that is
inborn in the structure of compositional optimisation problems and 2) the bias
of multi-step Hessian estimation caused by direct automatic differentiation. To
better understand the meta gradient biases, we perform the first of its kind
study to quantify the amount for each of them. We start by providing a unifying
derivation for existing GMRL algorithms, and then theoretically analyse both
the bias and the variance of existing gradient estimation methods. On
understanding the underlying principles of bias, we propose two mitigation
solutions based on off-policy correction and multi-step Hessian estimation
techniques. Comprehensive ablation studies have been conducted and results
reveals: (1) The existence of these two biases and how they influence the
meta-gradient estimation when combined with different estimator/sample
size/step and learning rate. (2) The effectiveness of these mitigation
approaches for meta-gradient estimation and thereby the final return on two
practical Meta-RL algorithms: LOLA-DiCE and Meta-gradient Reinforcement
Learning.</span>

classification that are transferable to new, unseen classes. Recent results in
the literature show that representations learned by a single classifier over
many classes are competitive on few-shot learning problems with representations
learned by special-purpose algorithms designed for such problems. In this paper
we provide an explanation for this behavior based on the recently observed
phenomenon that the features learned by overparameterized classification
networks show an interesting clustering property, called neural collapse. We
demonstrate both theoretically and empirically that neural collapse generalizes
to new samples from the training classes, and -- more importantly -- to new
classes as well, allowing foundation models to provide feature maps that work
well in transfer learning and, specifically, in the few-shot setting.</span>

                    <span>In this work, we review and evaluate a body of deep learning knowledge
tracing (DLKT) models with openly available and widely-used data sets, and with
a novel data set of students learning to program. The evaluated DLKT models
have been reimplemented for assessing reproducibility and replicability of
previously reported results. We test different input and output layer
variations found in the compared models that are independent of the main
architectures of the models, and different maximum attempt count options that
have been implicitly and explicitly used in some studies. Several metrics are
used to reflect on the quality of the evaluated knowledge tracing models. The
evaluated knowledge tracing models include Vanilla-DKT, two Long Short-Term
Memory Deep Knowledge Tracing (LSTM-DKT) variants, two Dynamic Key-Value Memory
Network (DKVMN) variants, and Self-Attentive Knowledge Tracing (SAKT). We
evaluate logistic regression, Bayesian Knowledge Tracing (BKT) and simple
non-learning models as baselines. Our results suggest that the DLKT models in
general outperform non-DLKT models, and the relative differences between the
DLKT models are subtle and often vary between datasets. Our results also show
that naive models such as mean prediction can yield better performance than
more sophisticated knowledge tracing models, especially in terms of accuracy.
Further, our metric and hyperparameter analysis shows that the metric used to
select the best model hyperparameters has a noticeable effect on the
performance of the models, and that metric choice can affect model ranking. We
also study the impact of input and output layer variations, filtering out long
attempt sequences, and non-model properties such as randomness and hardware.
Finally, we discuss model performance replicability and related issues. Our
model implementations, evaluation code, and data are published as a part of

aimed to maximize the expected reward, which are thus useful in searching the

applications (e.g., AlphaGo). However, in some typical application scenaios
such as drug discovery, the aim is to search a diverse set of candidates with
high reward. Here we propose a reversible upper confidence bound (rUCB)
algorithm for such a purpose, and demonstrate its application in virtual
screening upon intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs). It is shown that rUCB
greatly reduces the query times while achieving both high accuracy and low

                    <span>Turbulence simulation with classical numerical solvers requires very
high-resolution grids to accurately resolve dynamics. Here we train learned
simulators at low spatial and temporal resolutions to capture turbulent
dynamics generated at high resolution. We show that our proposed model can
simulate turbulent dynamics more accurately than classical numerical solvers at
the same low resolutions across various scientifically relevant metrics. Our
model is trained end-to-end from data and is capable of learning a range of
challenging chaotic and turbulent dynamics at low resolution, including
trajectories generated by the state-of-the-art Athena++ engine. We show that
our simpler, general-purpose architecture outperforms various more specialized,
turbulence-specific architectures from the learned turbulence simulation
literature. In general, we see that learned simulators yield unstable
trajectories; however, we show that tuning training noise and temporal
downsampling solves this problem. We also find that while generalization beyond
the training distribution is a challenge for learned models, training noise,
convolutional architectures, and added loss constraints can help. Broadly, we
conclude that our learned simulator outperforms traditional solvers run on
coarser grids, and emphasize that simple design choices can offer stability and
robust generalization.</span>

                    <span>Deep graph clustering, which aims to reveal the underlying graph structure
and divide the nodes into different groups, has attracted intensive attention
in recent years. However, we observe that, in the process of node encoding,
existing methods suffer from representation collapse which tends to map all
data into the same representation. Consequently, the discriminative capability
of the node representation is limited, leading to unsatisfied clustering
performance. To address this issue, we propose a novel self-supervised deep
graph clustering method termed Dual Correlation Reduction Network (DCRN) by
reducing information correlation in a dual manner. Specifically, in our method,
we first design a siamese network to encode samples. Then by forcing the
cross-view sample correlation matrix and cross-view feature correlation matrix
to approximate two identity matrices, respectively, we reduce the information
correlation in the dual-level, thus improving the discriminative capability of
the resulting features. Moreover, in order to alleviate representation collapse
caused by over-smoothing in GCN, we introduce a propagation regularization term
to enable the network to gain long-distance information with the shallow
network structure. Extensive experimental results on six benchmark datasets
demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed DCRN against the existing
state-of-the-art methods.</span>

                    <span>Active learning (AL) is a machine learning algorithm that can achieve greater
accuracy with fewer labeled training instances, for having the ability to ask
oracles to label the most valuable unlabeled data chosen iteratively and
heuristically by query strategies. Scientific experiments nowadays, though
becoming increasingly automated, are still suffering from human involvement in
the designing process and the exhaustive search in the experimental space. This
article performs a retrospective study on a drug response dataset using the
proposed AL scheme comprised of the matrix factorization method of alternating
least square (ALS) and deep neural networks (DNN). This article also proposes
an AL query strategy based on expected loss minimization. As a result, the
retrospective study demonstrates that scientific experimental design, instead
of being manually set, can be optimized by AL, and the proposed query strategy
ELM sampling shows better experimental performance than other ones such as
random sampling and uncertainty sampling.</span>

                    <span>Each grid block in a 3D geological model requires a rock type that represents
all physical and chemical properties of that block. The properties that
classify rock types are lithology, permeability, and capillary pressure.
Scientists and engineers determined these properties using conventional
laboratory measurements, which embedded destructive methods to the sample or
altered some of its properties (i.e., wettability, permeability, and porosity)
because the measurements process includes sample crushing, fluid flow, or fluid
saturation. Lately, Digital Rock Physics (DRT) has emerged to quantify these
properties from micro-Computerized Tomography (uCT) and Magnetic Resonance
Imaging (MRI) images. However, the literature did not attempt rock typing in a
wholly digital context. We propose performing Digital Rock Typing (DRT) by: (1)
integrating the latest DRP advances in a novel process that honors digital rock
properties determination, while; (2) digitalizing the latest rock typing
approaches in carbonate, and (3) introducing a novel carbonate rock typing
process that utilizes computer vision capabilities to provide more insight
about the heterogeneous carbonate rock texture.</span>

                    <span>Suppose we have a black-box function (e.g., deep neural network) that takes
an image as input and outputs a value that indicates preference. How can we
retrieve optimal images with respect to this function from an external database
on the Internet? Standard retrieval problems in the literature (e.g., item
recommendations) assume that an algorithm has full access to the set of items.
In other words, such algorithms are designed for service providers. In this
paper, we consider the retrieval problem under different assumptions.
Specifically, we consider how users with limited access to an image database
can retrieve images using their own black-box functions. This formulation
enables a flexible and finer-grained image search defined by each user. We
assume the user can access the database through a search query with tight API
limits. Therefore, a user needs to efficiently retrieve optimal images in terms
of the number of queries. We propose an efficient retrieval algorithm Tiara for
this problem. In the experiments, we confirm that our proposed method performs
better than several baselines under various settings.</span>

to their applicability in practice. With the increasing popularity of deep
learning over the past decade, stochastic gradient descent and its adaptive
variants (e.g. Adagrad, Adam, etc.) have become prominent methods of choice for
machine learning practitioners. While a large number of works have demonstrated

                    <span>Rhetorical Frames in AI can be thought of as expressions that describe AI
development as a competition between two or more actors, such as governments or
companies. Examples of such Frames include robotic arms race, AI rivalry,
technological supremacy, cyberwarfare dominance and 5G race. Detection of
Rhetorical Frames from open sources can help us track the attitudes of
governments or companies towards AI, specifically whether attitudes are
becoming more cooperative or competitive over time. Given the rapidly
increasing volumes of open sources (online news media, twitter, blogs), it is
difficult for subject matter experts to identify Rhetorical Frames in (near)
real-time. Moreover, these sources are in general unstructured (noisy) and
therefore, detecting Frames from these sources will require state-of-the-art
text classification techniques. In this paper, we develop RheFrameDetect, a
text classification system for (near) real-time capture of Rhetorical Frames
from open sources. Given an input document, RheFrameDetect employs text
classification techniques at multiple levels (document level and paragraph
level) to identify all occurrences of Frames used in the discussion of AI. We
performed extensive evaluation of the text classification techniques used in
RheFrameDetect against human annotated Frames from multiple news sources. To
further demonstrate the effectiveness of RheFrameDetect, we show multiple case
studies depicting the Frames identified by RheFrameDetect compared against
human annotated Frames.</span>

                    <span>During the SARS-Cov-2 pandemic, mask-wearing became an effective tool to
prevent spreading and contracting the virus. The ability to monitor the
mask-wearing rate in the population would be useful for determining public
health strategies against the virus. However, artificial intelligence
technologies for detecting face masks have not been deployed at a large scale
in real-life to measure the mask-wearing rate in public. In this paper, we
present a two-step face mask detection approach consisting of two separate
modules: 1) face detection and alignment and 2) face mask classification. This
approach allowed us to experiment with different combinations of face detection
and face mask classification modules. More specifically, we experimented with
PyramidKey and RetinaFace as face detectors while maintaining a lightweight
backbone for the face mask classification module. Moreover, we also provide a
relabeled annotation of the test set of the AIZOO dataset, where we rectified
the incorrect labels for some face images. The evaluation results on the AIZOO
and Moxa 3K datasets showed that the proposed face mask detection pipeline
surpassed the state-of-the-art methods. The proposed pipeline also yielded a
higher mAP on the relabeled test set of the AIZOO dataset than the original
test set. Since we trained the proposed model using in-the-wild face images, we
can successfully deploy our model to monitor the mask-wearing rate using public
CCTV images.</span>

                    <span>Domain adaptation tasks such as cross-domain sentiment classification aim to
utilize existing labeled data in the source domain and unlabeled or few labeled
data in the target domain to improve the performance in the target domain via
reducing the shift between the data distributions. Existing cross-domain
sentiment classification methods need to distinguish pivots, i.e., the
domain-shared sentiment words, and non-pivots, i.e., the domain-specific
sentiment words, for excellent adaptation performance. In this paper, we first
design a Category Attention Network (CAN), and then propose a model named
CAN-CNN to integrate CAN and a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). On the one
hand, the model regards pivots and non-pivots as unified category attribute
words and can automatically capture them to improve the domain adaptation
performance; on the other hand, the model makes an attempt at interpretability
to learn the transferred category attribute words. Specifically, the
optimization objective of our model has three different components: 1) the
supervised classification loss; 2) the distributions loss of category feature
weights; 3) the domain invariance loss. Finally, the proposed model is
evaluated on three public sentiment analysis datasets and the results
demonstrate that CAN-CNN can outperform other various baseline methods.</span>

                    <span>Graph neural networks (GNN) have shown outstanding applications in many
fields where data is fundamentally represented as graphs (e.g., chemistry,
biology, recommendation systems). In this vein, communication networks comprise
many fundamental components that are naturally represented in a
graph-structured manner (e.g., topology, configurations, traffic flows). This
position article presents GNNs as a fundamental tool for modeling, control and
management of communication networks. GNNs represent a new generation of
data-driven models that can accurately learn and reproduce the complex
behaviors behind real networks. As a result, such models can be applied to a
wide variety of networking use cases, such as planning, online optimization, or
troubleshooting. The main advantage of GNNs over traditional neural networks
lies in its unprecedented generalization capabilities when applied to other
networks and configurations unseen during training, which is a critical feature
for achieving practical data-driven solutions for networking. This article
comprises a brief tutorial on GNNs and their possible applications to
communication networks. To showcase the potential of this technology, we
present two use cases with state-of-the-art GNN models respectively applied to
wired and wireless networks. Lastly, we delve into the key open challenges and
opportunities yet to be explored in this novel research area.</span>

                    <span>The transformation of conventional power networks into smart grids with the
heavy penetration level of renewable energy resources, particularly
grid-connected Photovoltaic (PV) systems, has increased the need for efficient
fault identification systems. Malfunctioning any single component in
grid-connected PV systems may lead to grid instability and other serious
consequences, showing that a reliable fault identification system is the utmost
requirement for ensuring operational integrity. Therefore, this paper presents
a novel fault identification approach based on statistical signatures of PV
operational states. These signatures are unique because each fault has a
different nature and distinctive impact on the electrical system. Thus, the
Random Forest Classifier trained on these extracted signatures showed 100%
accuracy in identifying all types of faults. Furthermore, the performance
comparison of the proposed framework with other Machine Learning classifiers
depicts its credibility. Moreover, to elevate user trust in the predicted
outcomes, SHAP (Shapley Additive Explanation) was utilized during the training
phase to extract a complete model response (global explanation). This extracted
global explanation can help in the assessment of predicted outcomes credibility
by decoding each prediction in terms of features contribution. Hence, the
proposed explainable signature-based fault identification technique is highly
credible and fulfills all the requirements of smart grids.</span>

                    <span>Stochastic and soft optimal policies resulting from entropy-regularized
Markov decision processes (ER-MDP) are desirable for exploration and imitation
learning applications. Motivated by the fact that such policies are sensitive
with respect to the state transition probabilities, and the estimation of these
probabilities may be inaccurate, we study a robust version of the ER-MDP model,
where the stochastic optimal policies are required to be robust with respect to
the ambiguity in the underlying transition probabilities. Our work is at the
crossroads of two important schemes in reinforcement learning (RL), namely,
robust MDP and entropy regularized MDP. We show that essential properties that
hold for the non-robust ER-MDP and robust unregularized MDP models also hold in
our settings, making the robust ER-MDP problem tractable. We show how our
framework and results can be integrated into different algorithmic schemes
including value or (modified) policy iteration, which would lead to new robust
RL and inverse RL algorithms to handle uncertainties. Analyses on computational
complexity and error propagation under conventional uncertainty settings are

TD-learning is a linear stochastic iterative algorithm to estimate the value
function of a given policy for a Markov decision process, which is one of the
most popular and fundamental reinforcement learning algorithms. While there has
been a series of successful works in theoretical analysis of TD-learning, it
was not until recently that researchers found some guarantees on its
statistical efficiency. In this paper, we propose a control theoretic

combined together, they can solve a wide variety of unseen reinforcement
learning tasks with no or very little new data. Specifically, we consider the
framework of generalized policy evaluation and improvement, in which the
rewards for all tasks of interest are assumed to be expressible as a linear
combination of a fixed set of features. We show theoretically that, under
certain assumptions, having access to a specific set of diverse policies, which
we call a set of independent policies, can allow for instantaneously achieving
high-level performance on all possible downstream tasks which are typically
more complex than the ones on which the agent was trained. Based on this
theoretical analysis, we propose a simple algorithm that iteratively constructs
this set of policies. In addition to empirically validating our theoretical
results, we compare our approach with recently proposed diverse policy set
construction methods and show that, while others fail, our approach is able to
build a behavior basis that enables instantaneous transfer to all possible
downstream tasks. We also show empirically that having access to a set of
independent policies can better bootstrap the learning process on downstream
tasks where the new reward function cannot be described as a linear combination
of the features. Finally, we demonstrate that this policy set can be useful in
a realistic lifelong reinforcement learning setting.</span>

                    <span>Support vector machine (SVM) is a powerful classification method that has
achieved great success in many fields. Since its performance can be seriously
impaired by redundant covariates, model selection techniques are widely used
for SVM with high dimensional covariates. As an alternative to model selection,
significant progress has been made in the area of model averaging in the past
decades. Yet no frequentist model averaging method was considered for SVM. This
work aims to fill the gap and to propose a frequentist model averaging
procedure for SVM which selects the optimal weight by cross validation. Even
when the number of covariates diverges at an exponential rate of the sample
size, we show asymptotic optimality of the proposed method in the sense that
the ratio of its hinge loss to the lowest possible loss converges to one. We
also derive the convergence rate which provides more insights to model
averaging. Compared to model selection methods of SVM which require a tedious
but critical task of tuning parameter selection, the model averaging method
avoids the task and shows promising performances in the empirical studies.</span>

                    <span>In this paper, we focus on the decentralized optimization problem over the
Stiefel manifold, which is defined on a connected network of $d$ agents. The
objective is an average of $d$ local functions, and each function is privately
held by an agent and encodes its data. The agents can only communicate with
their neighbors in a collaborative effort to solve this problem. In existing
methods, multiple rounds of communications are required to guarantee the
convergence, giving rise to high communication costs. In contrast, this paper
proposes a decentralized algorithm, called DESTINY, which only invokes a single
round of communications per iteration. DESTINY combines gradient tracking
techniques with a novel approximate augmented Lagrangian function. The global
convergence to stationary points is rigorously established. Comprehensive
numerical experiments demonstrate that DESTINY has a strong potential to
deliver a cutting-edge performance in solving a variety of testing problems.</span>

                    <span>The current work intends to study the performance of the Hierarchical
Temporal Memory(HTM) theory for automated classification of text as well as
documents. HTM is a biologically inspired theory based on the working
principles of the human neocortex. The current study intends to provide an
alternative framework for document categorization using the Spatial Pooler
learning algorithm in the HTM Theory. As HTM accepts only a stream of binary
data as input, Latent Semantic Indexing(LSI) technique is used for extracting
the top features from the input and converting them into binary format. The
Spatial Pooler algorithm converts the binary input into sparse patterns with
similar input text having overlapping spatial patterns making it easy for
classifying the patterns into categories. The results obtained prove that HTM
theory, although is in its nascent stages, performs at par with most of the
popular machine learning based classifiers.</span>

                    <span>Classification predictive modeling involves the accurate assignment of
observations in a dataset to target classes or categories. There is an
increasing growth of real-world classification problems with severely
imbalanced class distributions. In this case, minority classes have much fewer
observations to learn from than those from majority classes. Despite this
sparsity, a minority class is often considered the more interesting class yet
developing a scientific learning algorithm suitable for the observations
presents countless challenges. In this article, we suggest a novel multi-class
classification algorithm specialized to handle severely imbalanced classes
based on the method we refer to as SAMME.C2. It blends the flexible mechanics
of the boosting techniques from SAMME algorithm, a multi-class classifier, and
Ada.C2 algorithm, a cost-sensitive binary classifier designed to address highly
class imbalances. Not only do we provide the resulting algorithm but we also
establish scientific and statistical formulation of our proposed SAMME.C2
algorithm. Through numerical experiments examining various degrees of
classifier difficulty, we demonstrate consistent superior performance of our
proposed model.</span>

                    <span>Various applications of farm animal imaging are based on the estimation of
weights of certain body parts and cuts from the CT images of animals. In many
cases, the complexity of the problem is increased by the enormous variability
of postures in CT images due to the scanning of non-sedated, living animals. In
this paper, we propose a general and robust approach for the estimation of the
weights of cuts and body parts from the CT images of (possibly) living animals.
We adapt multi-atlas based segmentation driven by elastic registration and
joint feature and model selection for the regression component to cape with the
large number of features and low number of samples. The proposed technique is
evaluated and illustrated through real applications in rabbit breeding
programs, showing r^2 scores 12% higher than previous techniques and methods
that used to drive the selection so far. The proposed technique is easily
adaptable to similar problems, consequently, it is shared in an open source
software package for the benefit of the community.</span>

                    <span>Heterogeneous graph neural networks (HGNNs) have been blossoming in recent
years, but the unique data processing and evaluation setups used by each work
obstruct a full understanding of their advancements. In this work, we present a
systematical reproduction of 12 recent HGNNs by using their official codes,
datasets, settings, and hyperparameters, revealing surprising findings about
the progress of HGNNs. We find that the simple homogeneous GNNs, e.g., GCN and
GAT, are largely underestimated due to improper settings. GAT with proper
inputs can generally match or outperform all existing HGNNs across various
scenarios. To facilitate robust and reproducible HGNN research, we construct
the Heterogeneous Graph Benchmark (HGB), consisting of 11 diverse datasets with
three tasks. HGB standardizes the process of heterogeneous graph data splits,
feature processing, and performance evaluation. Finally, we introduce a simple
but very strong baseline Simple-HGN--which significantly outperforms all
previous models on HGB--to accelerate the advancement of HGNNs in the future.</span>

simultaneously with respect to both function content and call graph

                    <span>Quantizing deep neural networks (DNNs) has been a promising solution for
deploying deep neural networks on embedded devices. However, most of the
existing methods do not quantize gradients, and the process of quantizing DNNs
still has a lot of floating-point operations, which hinders the further
applications of quantized DNNs. To solve this problem, we propose a new
heuristic method based on cooperative coevolution for quantizing DNNs. Under
the framework of cooperative coevolution, we use the estimation of distribution
algorithm to search for the low-bits weights. Specifically, we first construct
an initial quantized network from a pre-trained network instead of random
initialization and then start searching from it by restricting the search
space. So far, the problem is the largest discrete problem known to be solved
by evolutionary algorithms. Experiments show that our method can train 4 bit
ResNet-20 on the Cifar-10 dataset without sacrificing accuracy.</span>

                    <span>Many social media users prefer consuming content in the form of videos rather
than text. However, in order for content creators to produce videos with a high
click-through rate, much editing is needed to match the footage to the music.
This posts additional challenges for more amateur video makers. Therefore, we
propose a novel attention-based model VMT (Video-Music Transformer) that
automatically generates piano scores from video frames. Using music generated
from models also prevent potential copyright infringements that often come with
using existing music. To the best of our knowledge, there is no work besides
the proposed VMT that aims to compose music for video. Additionally, there
lacks a dataset with aligned video and symbolic music. We release a new dataset
composed of over 7 hours of piano scores with fine alignment between pop music
videos and MIDI files. We conduct experiments with human evaluation on VMT,
SeqSeq model (our baseline), and the original piano version soundtrack. VMT
achieves consistent improvements over the baseline on music smoothness and
video relevance. In particular, with the relevance scores and our case study,
our model has shown the capability of multimodality on frame-level actors&#x27;
movement for music generation. Our VMT model, along with the new dataset,

                    <span>Image synthesis and image recognition have witnessed remarkable progress, but
often at the expense of computationally expensive training and inference.
Learning lightweight yet expressive deep model has emerged as an important and
interesting direction. Inspired by the well-known split-transform-aggregate
design heuristic in the Inception building block, this paper proposes a
Skip-Layer Inception Module (SLIM) that facilitates efficient learning of image
synthesis models, and a same-layer variant (dubbed as SLIM too) as a stronger
alternative to the well-known ResNeXts for image recognition. In SLIM, the
input feature map is first split into a number of groups (e.g., 4).Each group
is then transformed to a latent style vector(via channel-wise attention) and a
latent spatial mask (via spatial attention). The learned latent masks and
latent style vectors are aggregated to modulate the target feature map. For
generative learning, SLIM is built on a recently proposed lightweight
Generative Adversarial Networks (i.e., FastGANs) which present a skip-layer
excitation(SLE) module. For few-shot image synthesis tasks, the proposed SLIM
achieves better performance than the SLE work and other related methods. For
one-shot image synthesis tasks, it shows stronger capability of preserving
images structures than prior arts such as the SinGANs. For image classification
tasks, the proposed SLIM is used as a drop-in replacement for convolution
layers in ResNets (resulting in ResNeXt-like models) and achieves better
accuracy in theImageNet-1000 dataset, with significantly smaller model
complexity</span>

                    <span>Deep learning is pervasive in our daily life, including self-driving cars,
virtual assistants, social network services, healthcare services, face
recognition, etc. However, deep neural networks demand substantial compute
resources during training and inference. The machine learning community has
mainly focused on model-level optimizations such as architectural compression
of deep learning models, while the system community has focused on
implementation-level optimization. In between, various arithmetic-level
optimization techniques have been proposed in the arithmetic community. This
article provides a survey on resource-efficient deep learning techniques in
terms of model-, arithmetic-, and implementation-level techniques and
identifies the research gaps for resource-efficient deep learning techniques
across the three different level techniques. Our survey clarifies the influence
from higher to lower-level techniques based on our resource-efficiency metric

                    <span>In this thesis, we address the problem of estimating the 6D pose of rigid
objects from a single RGB or RGB-D input image, assuming that 3D models of the
objects are available. This problem is of great importance to many application
fields such as robotic manipulation, augmented reality, and autonomous driving.
First, we propose EPOS, a method for 6D object pose estimation from an RGB
image. The key idea is to represent an object by compact surface fragments and
predict the probability distribution of corresponding fragments at each pixel
of the input image by a neural network. Each pixel is linked with a
data-dependent number of fragments, which allows systematic handling of
symmetries, and the 6D poses are estimated from the links by a RANSAC-based
fitting method. EPOS outperformed all RGB and most RGB-D and D methods on
several standard datasets. Second, we present HashMatch, an RGB-D method that
slides a window over the input image and searches for a match against
templates, which are pre-generated by rendering 3D object models in different
orientations. The method applies a cascade of evaluation stages to each window
location, which avoids exhaustive matching against all templates. Third, we
propose ObjectSynth, an approach to synthesize photorealistic images of 3D
object models for training methods based on neural networks. The images yield
substantial improvements compared to commonly used images of objects rendered
on top of random photographs. Fourth, we introduce T-LESS, the first dataset
for 6D object pose estimation that includes 3D models and RGB-D images of
industry-relevant objects. Fifth, we define BOP, a benchmark that captures the
status quo in the field. BOP comprises eleven datasets in a unified format, an
evaluation methodology, an online evaluation system, and public challenges held
at international workshops organized at the ICCV and ECCV conferences.</span>

                    <span>Branch prediction is an architectural feature that speeds up the execution of
branch instruction on pipeline processors and reduces the cost of branching.
Recent advancements of Deep Learning (DL) in the post Moore&#x27;s Law era is
accelerating areas of automated chip design, low-power computer architectures,
and much more. Traditional computer architecture design and algorithms could
benefit from dynamic predictors based on deep learning algorithms which learns
from experience by optimizing its parameters on large number of data. In this
survey paper, we focus on traditional branch prediction algorithms, analyzes
its limitations, and presents a literature survey of how deep learning
techniques can be applied to create dynamic branch predictors capable of
predicting conditional branch instructions. Prior surveys in this field focus
on dynamic branch prediction techniques based on neural network perceptrons. We
plan to improve the survey based on latest research in DL and advanced Machine
Learning (ML) based branch predictors.</span>

                    <span>Linear dynamical systems are canonical models for learning-based control of
plants with uncertain dynamics. The setting consists of a stochastic
differential equation that captures the state evolution of the plant
understudy, while the true dynamics matrices are unknown and need to be learned
from the observed data of state trajectory. An important issue is to ensure
that the system is stabilized and destabilizing control actions due to model
uncertainties are precluded as soon as possible. A reliable stabilization
procedure for this purpose that can effectively learn from unstable data to
stabilize the system in a finite time is not currently available. In this work,
we propose a novel Bayesian learning algorithm that stabilizes unknown
continuous-time stochastic linear systems. The presented algorithm is flexible
and exposes effective stabilization performance after a remarkably short time
period of interacting with the system.</span>

                    <span>We study reinforcement learning (RL) with linear function approximation.
Existing algorithms for this problem only have high-probability regret and/or
Probably Approximately Correct (PAC) sample complexity guarantees, which cannot
guarantee the convergence to the optimal policy. In this paper, in order to
overcome the limitation of existing algorithms, we propose a new algorithm
called FLUTE, which enjoys uniform-PAC convergence to the optimal policy with
high probability. The uniform-PAC guarantee is the strongest possible guarantee
for reinforcement learning in the literature, which can directly imply both PAC
and high probability regret bounds, making our algorithm superior to all
existing algorithms with linear function approximation. At the core of our
algorithm is a novel minimax value function estimator and a multi-level
partition scheme to select the training samples from historical observations.
Both of these techniques are new and of independent interest.</span>

                    <span>Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) provides asymptotically consistent estimates
of intractable posterior expectations as the number of iterations tends to
infinity. However, in large data applications, MCMC can be computationally
expensive per iteration. This has catalyzed interest in sampling methods such
as approximate MCMC, which trade off asymptotic consistency for improved
computational speed. In this article, we propose estimators based on couplings
of Markov chains to assess the quality of such asymptotically biased sampling
methods. The estimators give empirical upper bounds of the Wassertein distance
between the limiting distribution of the asymptotically biased sampling method
and the original target distribution of interest. We establish theoretical
guarantees for our upper bounds and show that our estimators can remain
effective in high dimensions. We apply our quality measures to stochastic
gradient MCMC, variational Bayes, and Laplace approximations for tall data and
to approximate MCMC for Bayesian logistic regression in 4500 dimensions and
Bayesian linear regression in 50000 dimensions.</span>

                    <span>We consider a high-dimensional model in which variables are observed over
time and space. The model consists of a spatio-temporal regression containing a
time lag and a spatial lag of the dependent variable. Unlike classical spatial
autoregressive models, we do not rely on a predetermined spatial interaction
matrix, but infer all spatial interactions from the data. Assuming sparsity, we
estimate the spatial and temporal dependence fully data-driven by penalizing a
set of Yule-Walker equations. This regularization can be left unstructured, but
we also propose customized shrinkage procedures when observations originate
from spatial grids (e.g. satellite images). Finite sample error bounds are
derived and estimation consistency is established in an asymptotic framework
wherein the sample size and the number of spatial units diverge jointly.
Exogenous variables can be included as well. A simulation exercise shows strong
finite sample performance compared to competing procedures. As an empirical
application, we model satellite measured NO2 concentrations in London. Our
approach delivers forecast improvements over a competitive benchmark and we
discover evidence for strong spatial interactions.</span>

                    <span>Generative models can be trained to emulate complex empirical data, but are
they useful to make predictions in the context of previously unobserved
environments? An intuitive idea to promote such extrapolation capabilities is
to have the architecture of such model reflect a causal graph of the true data
generating process, such that one can intervene on each node independently of
the others. However, the nodes of this graph are usually unobserved, leading to
overparameterization and lack of identifiability of the causal structure. We
develop a theoretical framework to address this challenging situation by
defining a weaker form of identifiability, based on the principle of
independence of mechanisms. We demonstrate on toy examples that classical
stochastic gradient descent can hinder the model&#x27;s extrapolation capabilities,
suggesting independence of mechanisms should be enforced explicitly during
training. Experiments on deep generative models trained on real world data
support these insights and illustrate how the extrapolation capabilities of
such models can be leveraged.</span>

                    <span>Score-based generative models (SGMs) have demonstrated remarkable synthesis
quality. SGMs rely on a diffusion process that gradually perturbs the data
towards a tractable distribution, while the generative model learns to denoise.
The complexity of this denoising task is, apart from the data distribution
itself, uniquely determined by the diffusion process. We argue that current
SGMs employ overly simplistic diffusions, leading to unnecessarily complex
denoising processes, which limit generative modeling performance. Based on
connections to statistical mechanics, we propose a novel critically-damped
Langevin diffusion (CLD) and show that CLD-based SGMs achieve superior
performance. CLD can be interpreted as running a joint diffusion in an extended
space, where the auxiliary variables can be considered &quot;velocities&quot; that are
coupled to the data variables as in Hamiltonian dynamics. We derive a novel
score matching objective for CLD and show that the model only needs to learn
the score function of the conditional distribution of the velocity given data,
an easier task than learning scores of the data directly. We also derive a new
sampling scheme for efficient synthesis from CLD-based diffusion models. We
find that CLD outperforms previous SGMs in synthesis quality for similar
network architectures and sampling compute budgets. We show that our novel
sampler for CLD significantly outperforms solvers such as Euler--Maruyama. Our
framework provides new insights into score-based denoising diffusion models and
can be readily used for high-resolution image synthesis. Project page and code:

have achieved scalable Gaussian process inference with highly accurate point

struggle with numerical instabilities in learning kernel hyperparameters, and
poor test likelihoods. By investigating CG tolerance, preconditioner rank, and
Lanczos decomposition rank, we provide a particularly simple prescription to
correct these issues: we recommend that one should use a small CG tolerance
($\epsilon \leq 0.01$) and a large root decomposition size ($r \geq 5000$).
Moreover, we show that L-BFGS-B is a compelling optimizer for Iterative GPs,

on quadratic models to figure out which methods are suited for non-convex
optimization, and develop convergence proofs on convex functions for this
selection of methods. With this theoretical foundation for stochastic gradient
descent and momentum methods, we try to explain why the methods used commonly
in the machine learning field are so successful. Besides explaining successful
heuristics, the last chapter also provides a less extensive review of more
theoretical methods, which are not quite as popular in practice. So in some

                    <span>We study the model-based reward-free reinforcement learning with linear
function approximation for episodic Markov decision processes (MDPs). In this
setting, the agent works in two phases. In the exploration phase, the agent
interacts with the environment and collects samples without the reward. In the
planning phase, the agent is given a specific reward function and uses samples
collected from the exploration phase to learn a good policy. We propose a new
provably efficient algorithm, called UCRL-RFE under the Linear Mixture MDP
assumption, where the transition probability kernel of the MDP can be
parameterized by a linear function over certain feature mappings defined on the
triplet of state, action, and next state. We show that to obtain an
$\epsilon$-optimal policy for arbitrary reward function, UCRL-RFE needs to
sample at most $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(H^5d^2\epsilon^{-2})$ episodes during the
exploration phase. Here, $H$ is the length of the episode, $d$ is the dimension
of the feature mapping. We also propose a variant of UCRL-RFE using
Bernstein-type bonus and show that it needs to sample at most
$\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(H^4d(H + d)\epsilon^{-2})$ to achieve an
$\epsilon$-optimal policy. By constructing a special class of linear Mixture
MDPs, we also prove that for any reward-free algorithm, it needs to sample at
least $\tilde \Omega(H^2d\epsilon^{-2})$ episodes to obtain an
$\epsilon$-optimal policy. Our upper bound matches the lower bound in terms of
the dependence on $\epsilon$ and the dependence on $d$ if $H \ge d$.</span>

                    <span>A/B testing, or online experiment is a standard business strategy to compare
a new product with an old one in pharmaceutical, technological, and traditional
industries. Major challenges arise in online experiments of two-sided
marketplace platforms (e.g., Uber) where there is only one unit that receives a
sequence of treatments over time. In those experiments, the treatment at a
given time impacts current outcome as well as future outcomes. The aim of this
paper is to introduce a reinforcement learning framework for carrying A/B
testing in these experiments, while characterizing the long-term treatment
effects. Our proposed testing procedure allows for sequential monitoring and
online updating. It is generally applicable to a variety of treatment designs
in different industries. In addition, we systematically investigate the
theoretical properties (e.g., size and power) of our testing procedure.
Finally, we apply our framework to both simulated data and a real-world data
example obtained from a technological company to illustrate its advantage over
the current practice. A Python implementation of our test is available at

                    <span>Recent advances in machine learning have largely benefited from the massive
accessible training data. However, large-scale data sharing has raised great
privacy concerns. In this work, we propose a novel privacy-preserving data
Generative model based on the PATE framework (G-PATE), aiming to train a
scalable differentially private data generator that preserves high generated
data utility. Our approach leverages generative adversarial nets to generate
data, combined with private aggregation among different discriminators to
ensure strong privacy guarantees. Compared to existing approaches, G-PATE
significantly improves the use of privacy budgets. In particular, we train a
student data generator with an ensemble of teacher discriminators and propose a
novel private gradient aggregation mechanism to ensure differential privacy on
all information that flows from teacher discriminators to the student
generator. In addition, with random projection and gradient discretization, the
proposed gradient aggregation mechanism is able to effectively deal with
high-dimensional gradient vectors. Theoretically, we prove that G-PATE ensures
differential privacy for the data generator. Empirically, we demonstrate the
superiority of G-PATE over prior work through extensive experiments. We show
that G-PATE is the first work being able to generate high-dimensional image
data with high data utility under limited privacy budgets ($\epsilon \le 1$).

                    <span>We propose to model matrix time series based on a tensor CP-decomposition.
Instead of using an iterative algorithm which is the standard practice for
estimating CP-decompositions, we propose a new and one-pass estimation
procedure based on a generalized eigenanalysis constructed from the serial
dependence structure of the underlying process. A key idea of the new procedure
is to project a generalized eigenequation defined in terms of rank-reduced
matrices to a lower-dimensional one with full-ranked matrices, to avoid the
intricacy of the former of which the number of eigenvalues can be zero, finite
and infinity. The asymptotic theory has been established under a general
setting without the stationarity. It shows, for example, that all the component
coefficient vectors in the CP-decomposition are estimated consistently with the
different error rates, depending on the relative sizes between the dimensions
of time series and the sample size. The proposed model and the estimation
method are further illustrated with both simulated and real data; showing
effective dimension-reduction in modelling and forecasting matrix time series.</span>

                    <span>Adversarial training is so far the most effective strategy in defending
against adversarial examples. However, it suffers from high computational costs
due to the iterative adversarial attacks in each training step. Recent studies
show that it is possible to achieve fast Adversarial Training by performing a
single-step attack with random initialization. However, such an approach still
lags behind state-of-the-art adversarial training algorithms on both stability
and model robustness. In this work, we develop a new understanding towards Fast
Adversarial Training, by viewing random initialization as performing randomized
smoothing for better optimization of the inner maximization problem. Following
this new perspective, we also propose a new initialization strategy, backward
smoothing, to further improve the stability and model robustness over
single-step robust training methods. Experiments on multiple benchmarks
demonstrate that our method achieves similar model robustness as the original
TRADES method while using much less training time ($\sim$3x improvement with
the same training schedule).</span>

                    <span>Linear dynamical systems are canonical models for learning-based control of
plants with uncertain dynamics. The setting consists of a stochastic
differential equation that captures the state evolution of the plant
understudy, while the true dynamics matrices are unknown and need to be learned
from the observed data of state trajectory. An important issue is to ensure
that the system is stabilized and destabilizing control actions due to model
uncertainties are precluded as soon as possible. A reliable stabilization
procedure for this purpose that can effectively learn from unstable data to
stabilize the system in a finite time is not currently available. In this work,
we propose a novel Bayesian learning algorithm that stabilizes unknown
continuous-time stochastic linear systems. The presented algorithm is flexible
and exposes effective stabilization performance after a remarkably short time
period of interacting with the system.</span>

                    <span>In this paper, we focus on the decentralized optimization problem over the
Stiefel manifold, which is defined on a connected network of $d$ agents. The
objective is an average of $d$ local functions, and each function is privately
held by an agent and encodes its data. The agents can only communicate with
their neighbors in a collaborative effort to solve this problem. In existing
methods, multiple rounds of communications are required to guarantee the
convergence, giving rise to high communication costs. In contrast, this paper
proposes a decentralized algorithm, called DESTINY, which only invokes a single
round of communications per iteration. DESTINY combines gradient tracking
techniques with a novel approximate augmented Lagrangian function. The global
convergence to stationary points is rigorously established. Comprehensive
numerical experiments demonstrate that DESTINY has a strong potential to
deliver a cutting-edge performance in solving a variety of testing problems.</span>

                    <span>&quot;Benign overfitting&quot;, where classifiers memorize noisy training data yet
still achieve a good generalization performance, has drawn great attention in
the machine learning community. To explain this surprising phenomenon, a series
of works have provided theoretical justification in over-parameterized linear
regression, classification, and kernel methods. However, it is not clear if
benign overfitting still occurs in the presence of adversarial examples, i.e.,
examples with tiny and intentional perturbations to fool the classifiers. In
this paper, we show that benign overfitting indeed occurs in adversarial
training, a principled approach to defend against adversarial examples. In
detail, we prove the risk bounds of the adversarially trained linear classifier
on the mixture of sub-Gaussian data under $\ell_p$ adversarial perturbations.
Our result suggests that under moderate perturbations, adversarially trained
linear classifiers can achieve the near-optimal standard and adversarial risks,
despite overfitting the noisy training data. Numerical experiments validate our
theoretical findings.</span>

                    <span>Tree-based algorithms such as random forests and gradient boosted trees
continue to be among the most popular and powerful machine learning models used
across multiple disciplines. The conventional wisdom of estimating the impact
of a feature in tree based models is to measure the \textit{node-wise reduction
of a loss function}, which (i) yields only global importance measures and (ii)
is known to suffer from severe biases. Conditional feature contributions (CFCs)
provide \textit{local}, case-by-case explanations of a prediction by following
the decision path and attributing changes in the expected output of the model
to each feature along the path. However, Lundberg et al. pointed out a
potential bias of CFCs which depends on the distance from the root of a tree.
The by now immensely popular alternative, SHapley Additive exPlanation (SHAP)
values appear to mitigate this bias but are computationally much more
expensive. Here we contribute a thorough comparison of the explanations
computed by both methods on a set of 164 publicly available classification
problems in order to provide data-driven algorithm recommendations to current
researchers. For random forests, we find extremely high similarities and
correlations of both local and global SHAP values and CFC scores, leading to
very similar rankings and interpretations. Analogous conclusions hold for the
fidelity of using global feature importance scores as a proxy for the
predictive power associated with each feature.</span>

                    <span>The effectiveness of traditional traffic prediction methods is often
extremely limited when forecasting traffic dynamics in early morning. The
reason is that traffic can break down drastically during the early morning
commute, and the time and duration of this break-down vary substantially from
day to day. Early morning traffic forecast is crucial to inform morning-commute
traffic management, but they are generally challenging to predict in advance,
particularly by midnight. In this paper, we propose to mine Twitter messages as
a probing method to understand the impacts of people&#x27;s work and rest patterns
in the evening/midnight of the previous day to the next-day morning traffic.
The model is tested on freeway networks in Pittsburgh as experiments. The
resulting relationship is surprisingly simple and powerful. We find that, in
general, the earlier people rest as indicated from Tweets, the more congested
roads will be in the next morning. The occurrence of big events in the evening
before, represented by higher or lower tweet sentiment than normal, often
implies lower travel demand in the next morning than normal days. Besides,
people&#x27;s tweeting activities in the night before and early morning are
statistically associated with congestion in morning peak hours. We make use of
such relationships to build a predictive framework which forecasts morning
commute congestion using people&#x27;s tweeting profiles extracted by 5 am or as
late as the midnight prior to the morning. The Pittsburgh study supports that
our framework can precisely predict morning congestion, particularly for some
road segments upstream of roadway bottlenecks with large day-to-day congestion
variation. Our approach considerably outperforms those existing methods without
Twitter message features, and it can learn meaningful representation of demand
from tweeting profiles that offer managerial insights.</span>

                    <span>There have been significant efforts devoted to solving the longevity risk
given that a continuous growth in population ageing has become a severe issue
for many developed countries over the past few decades. The Cairns-Blake-Dowd
(CBD) model, which incorporates cohort effects parameters in its parsimonious
design, is one of the most well-known approaches for mortality modelling at
higher ages and longevity risk. This article proposes a novel mixed-effects
time-series approach for mortality modelling and forecasting with
considerations of age groups dependence and random cohort effects parameters.
The proposed model can disclose more mortality data information and provide a
natural quantification of the model parameters uncertainties with no
pre-specified constraint required for estimating the cohort effects parameters.
The abilities of the proposed approach are demonstrated through two
applications with empirical male and female mortality data. The proposed
approach shows remarkable improvements in terms of forecast accuracy compared
to the CBD model in the short-, mid-and long-term forecasting using mortality
data of several developed countries in the numerical examples.</span>

simultaneously with respect to both function content and call graph

                    <span>We investigate multiple testing and variable selection using the Least Angle
Regression (LARS) algorithm in high dimensions under the assumption of Gaussian
noise. LARS is known to produce a piecewise affine solution path with change
points referred to as the knots of the LARS path. The key to our results is an
expression in closed form of the exact joint law of a $K$-tuple of knots
conditional on the variables selected by LARS, namely the so-called
post-selection joint law of the LARS knots. Numerical experiments demonstrate
the perfect fit of our findings.

This paper makes three main contributions. First, we build testing procedures
on variables entering the model along the LARS path in the general design case
when the noise level can be unknown. These testing procedures are referred to
as the Generalized $t$-Spacing tests (GtSt) and we prove that they have an
exact non-asymptotic level (i.e., the Type I error is exactly controlled). This
extends work of (Taylor et al., 2014) where the spacing test works for
consecutive knots and known variance. Second, we introduce a new exact multiple
false negatives test after model selection in the general design case when the
noise level may be unknown. We prove that this testing procedure has exact
non-asymptotic level for general design and unknown noise level. Third, we give
an exact control of the false discovery rate under orthogonal design
assumption. Monte Carlo simulations and a real data experiment are provided to
illustrate our results in this case. Of independent interest, we introduce an
equivalent formulation of the LARS algorithm based on a recursive function.</span>

statistical models. In particular, we establish the statistical consistency and

                    <span>The gradient noise of Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) is considered to play
a key role in its properties (e.g. escaping low potential points and
regularization). Past research has indicated that the covariance of the SGD
error done via minibatching plays a critical role in determining its
regularization and escape from low potential points. It is however not much
explored how much the distribution of the error influences the behavior of the
algorithm. Motivated by some new research in this area, we prove universality
results by showing that noise classes that have the same mean and covariance
structure of SGD via minibatching have similar properties. We mainly consider
the Multiplicative Stochastic Gradient Descent (M-SGD) algorithm as introduced
by Wu et al., which has a much more general noise class than the SGD algorithm
done via minibatching. We establish nonasymptotic bounds for the M-SGD
algorithm mainly with respect to the Stochastic Differential Equation
corresponding to SGD via minibatching. We also show that the M-SGD error is
approximately a scaled Gaussian distribution with mean $0$ at any fixed point
of the M-SGD algorithm. We also establish bounds for the convergence of the
M-SGD algorithm in the strongly convex regime.</span>

                    <span>Approximate message passing (AMP) is a promising technique for unknown signal
reconstruction of certain high-dimensional linear systems with non-Gaussian
signaling. A distinguished feature of the AMP-type algorithms is that their
dynamics can be rigorously described by state evolution. However, state
evolution does not necessarily guarantee the convergence of iterative
algorithms. To solve the convergence problem of AMP-type algorithms in
principle, this paper proposes a memory AMP (MAMP) under a sufficient statistic
condition, named sufficient statistic MAMP (SS-MAMP). We show that the
covariance matrices of SS-MAMP are L-banded and convergent. Given an arbitrary
MAMP, we can construct an SS-MAMP by damping, which not only ensures the
convergence of MAMP but also preserves the orthogonality of MAMP, i.e., its
dynamics can be rigorously described by state evolution. As a byproduct, we
prove that the Bayes-optimal orthogonal/vector AMP (BO-OAMP/VAMP) is an
SS-MAMP. As a result, we reveal two interesting properties of BO-OAMP/VAMP for
large systems: 1) the covariance matrices are L-banded and are convergent in
BO-OAMP/VAMP, and 2) damping and memory are useless (i.e., do not bring
performance improvement) in BO-OAMP/VAMP. As an example, we construct a
sufficient statistic Bayes-optimal MAMP (BO-MAMP), which is Bayes optimal if
its state evolution has a unique fixed point and its MSE is not worse than the
original BO-MAMP. Finally, simulations are provided to verify the validity and
accuracy of the theoretical results.</span>

                    <span>Classification predictive modeling involves the accurate assignment of
observations in a dataset to target classes or categories. There is an
increasing growth of real-world classification problems with severely
imbalanced class distributions. In this case, minority classes have much fewer
observations to learn from than those from majority classes. Despite this
sparsity, a minority class is often considered the more interesting class yet
developing a scientific learning algorithm suitable for the observations
presents countless challenges. In this article, we suggest a novel multi-class
classification algorithm specialized to handle severely imbalanced classes
based on the method we refer to as SAMME.C2. It blends the flexible mechanics
of the boosting techniques from SAMME algorithm, a multi-class classifier, and
Ada.C2 algorithm, a cost-sensitive binary classifier designed to address highly
class imbalances. Not only do we provide the resulting algorithm but we also
establish scientific and statistical formulation of our proposed SAMME.C2
algorithm. Through numerical experiments examining various degrees of
classifier difficulty, we demonstrate consistent superior performance of our
proposed model.</span>

                    <span>A recent line of research on deep learning focuses on the extremely
over-parameterized setting, and shows that when the network width is larger
than a high degree polynomial of the training sample size $n$ and the inverse
of the target error $\epsilon^{-1}$, deep neural networks learned by
(stochastic) gradient descent enjoy nice optimization and generalization
guarantees. Very recently, it is shown that under certain margin assumptions on
the training data, a polylogarithmic width condition suffices for two-layer
ReLU networks to converge and generalize (Ji and Telgarsky, 2019). However,
whether deep neural networks can be learned with such a mild
over-parameterization is still an open question. In this work, we answer this
question affirmatively and establish sharper learning guarantees for deep ReLU
networks trained by (stochastic) gradient descent. In specific, under certain
assumptions made in previous work, our optimization and generalization
guarantees hold with network width polylogarithmic in $n$ and $\epsilon^{-1}$.
Our results push the study of over-parameterized deep neural networks towards
more practical settings.</span>

                    <span>Information-theoretic measures have been widely adopted in the design of
features for learning and decision problems. Inspired by this, we look at the
relationship between i) a weak form of information loss in the Shannon sense
and ii) the operation loss in the minimum probability of error (MPE) sense when
considering a family of lossy continuous representations (features) of a
continuous observation. We present several results that shed light on this
interplay. Our first result offers a lower bound on a weak form of information
loss as a function of its respective operation loss when adopting a discrete
lossy representation (quantization) instead of the original raw observation.
From this, our main result shows that a specific form of vanishing information
loss (a weak notion of asymptotic informational sufficiency) implies a
vanishing MPE loss (or asymptotic operational sufficiency) when considering a
general family of lossy continuous representations. Our theoretical findings
support the observation that the selection of feature representations that
attempt to capture informational sufficiency is appropriate for learning, but
this selection is a rather conservative design principle if the intended goal
is achieving MPE in classification. Supporting this last point, and under some
structural conditions, we show that it is possible to adopt an alternative
notion of informational sufficiency (strictly weaker than pure sufficiency in
the mutual information sense) to achieve operational sufficiency in learning.</span>

                    <span>Thompson Sampling (TS) is one of the most effective algorithms for solving
contextual multi-armed bandit problems. In this paper, we propose a new
algorithm, called Neural Thompson Sampling, which adapts deep neural networks
for both exploration and exploitation. At the core of our algorithm is a novel
posterior distribution of the reward, where its mean is the neural network
approximator, and its variance is built upon the neural tangent features of the
corresponding neural network. We prove that, provided the underlying reward
function is bounded, the proposed algorithm is guaranteed to achieve a
cumulative regret of $\mathcal{O}(T^{1/2})$, which matches the regret of other
contextual bandit algorithms in terms of total round number $T$. Experimental
comparisons with other benchmark bandit algorithms on various data sets
corroborate our theory.</span>

                    <span>Support vector machine (SVM) is a powerful classification method that has
achieved great success in many fields. Since its performance can be seriously
impaired by redundant covariates, model selection techniques are widely used
for SVM with high dimensional covariates. As an alternative to model selection,
significant progress has been made in the area of model averaging in the past
decades. Yet no frequentist model averaging method was considered for SVM. This
work aims to fill the gap and to propose a frequentist model averaging
procedure for SVM which selects the optimal weight by cross validation. Even
when the number of covariates diverges at an exponential rate of the sample
size, we show asymptotic optimality of the proposed method in the sense that
the ratio of its hinge loss to the lowest possible loss converges to one. We
also derive the convergence rate which provides more insights to model
averaging. Compared to model selection methods of SVM which require a tedious
but critical task of tuning parameter selection, the model averaging method
avoids the task and shows promising performances in the empirical studies.</span>

                    <span>Hierarchical forecasting with intermittent time series is a challenge in both
research and empirical studies. Extensive research focuses on improving the
accuracy of each hierarchy, especially the intermittent time series at bottom
levels. Then hierarchical reconciliation could be used to improve the overall
performance further. In this paper, we present a
\emph{hierarchical-forecasting-with-alignment} approach that treats the bottom
level forecasts as mutable to ensure higher forecasting accuracy on the upper
levels of the hierarchy. We employ a pure deep learning forecasting approach
N-BEATS for continuous time series at the top levels and a widely used
tree-based algorithm LightGBM for the intermittent time series at the bottom
level. The \emph{hierarchical-forecasting-with-alignment} approach is a simple
yet effective variant of the bottom-up method, accounting for biases that are
difficult to observe at the bottom level. It allows suboptimal forecasts at the
lower level to retain a higher overall performance. The approach in this
empirical study was developed by the first author during the M5 Forecasting
Accuracy competition, ranking second place. The method is also business
orientated and could benefit for business strategic planning.</span>

                    <span>Deep neural networks (DNNs) are powerful tools for compressing and distilling
information. Due to their scale and complexity, often involving billions of
inter-dependent internal degrees of freedom, exact analysis approaches often
fall short. A common strategy in such cases is to identify slow degrees of
freedom that average out the erratic behavior of the underlying fast
microscopic variables. Here, we identify such a separation of scales occurring
in over-parameterized deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) at the end of
training. It implies that neuron pre-activations fluctuate in a nearly Gaussian
manner with a deterministic latent kernel. While for CNNs with infinitely many
channels these kernels are inert, for finite CNNs they adapt and learn from
data in an analytically tractable manner. The resulting thermodynamic theory of
deep learning yields accurate predictions on several deep non-linear CNN toy
models. In addition, it provides new ways of analyzing and understanding CNNs.</span>

                    <span>We consider Bayesian optimization of the output of a network of functions,
where each function takes as input the output of its parent nodes, and where
the network takes significant time to evaluate. Such problems arise, for
example, in reinforcement learning, engineering design, and manufacturing.
While the standard Bayesian optimization approach observes only the final
output, our approach delivers greater query efficiency by leveraging
information that the former ignores: intermediate output within the network.
This is achieved by modeling the nodes of the network using Gaussian processes
and choosing the points to evaluate using, as our acquisition function, the
expected improvement computed with respect to the implied posterior on the
objective. Although the non-Gaussian nature of this posterior prevents
computing our acquisition function in closed form, we show that it can be
efficiently maximized via sample average approximation. In addition, we prove
that our method is asymptotically consistent, meaning that it finds a globally
optimal solution as the number of evaluations grows to infinity, thus
generalizing previously known convergence results for the expected improvement.
Notably, this holds even though our method might not evaluate the domain
densely, instead leveraging problem structure to leave regions unexplored.
Finally, we show that our approach dramatically outperforms standard Bayesian
optimization methods in several synthetic and real-world problems.</span>

                    <span>One of the reasons that many neural networks are capable of replicating
complicated tasks or functions is their universality property. The past few
decades have seen many attempts in providing constructive proofs for single or
class of neural networks. This paper is an effort to provide a unified and
constructive framework for the universality of a large class of activations
including most of existing activations and beyond. At the heart of the
framework is the concept of neural network approximate identity. It turns out
that most of existing activations are neural network approximate identity, and
thus universal in the space of continuous of functions on compacta. The
framework induces several advantages. First, it is constructive with elementary
means from functional analysis, probability theory, and numerical analysis.
Second, it is the first unified attempt that is valid for most of existing
activations. Third, as a by product, the framework provides the first
university proof for some of the existing activation functions including Mish,
SiLU, ELU, GELU, and etc. Fourth, it discovers new activations with guaranteed
universality property. Indeed, any activation\textemdash whose $\k$th
derivative, with $\k$ being an integer, is integrable and essentially
bounded\textemdash is universal. Fifth, for a given activation and error
tolerance, the framework provides precisely the architecture of the
corresponding one-hidden neural network with predetermined number of neuron,
and the values of weights/biases.</span>

evaluating distances of datapoints with a subset of the cluster centres. Our
contribution is substantially more efficient than k-means as it does not
require an all to all comparison of data points and clusters. We show that the
optimal solutions of our approximation are the same as in the exact solution.
However, our approach is considerably more efficient at extracting these
clusters compared to the state-of-the-art. We compare our approximation with
the exact k-means and alternative approximation approaches on a series of
standardised clustering tasks. For the evaluation, we consider the algorithmic
complexity, including number of operations to convergence, and the stability of
the results.</span>

particular, optimal transport has been used to develop probability metrics
between probability distributions. We introduce in this paper an independence
criterion based on entropy regularized optimal transport. Our criterion can be
used to test for independence between two samples. We establish non-asymptotic

                    <span>Discussion: Discussion Thread for comments, corrections, or any feedback. Summary: The latest batch of language models can be much smaller yet achieve GPT-3 like performance by being able to query a database or search the web for information. A key indication is that building larger and larger models is not the only way to improve performance. The last few years saw the rise of Large Language Models (LLMs) – machine learning models that rapidly improve how machines process and generate language. Some of the highlights since 2017 include: The original Transformer breaks previous performance records for machine translation. BERT popularizes the pre-training then finetuning process, as well as Transformer-based contextualized word embeddings. It then rapidly starts to power Google Search and Bing Search. GPT-2 demonstrates the machine’s ability to write as well as humans do. First T5, then T0 push the boundaries of transfer learning (training a model on one task, and then having it do well on other adjacent tasks) and posing a lot of different tasks as text-to-text tasks. GPT-3 showed that massive scaling of generative models can lead to shocking emergent applications (the industry continues to train larger models like Gopher, MT-NLG…etc). For a while, it seemed like scaling larger and larger models is the main way to improve performance. Recent developments in the field, like DeepMind’s RETRO Transformer and OpenAI’s WebGPT, reverse this trend by showing that smaller generative language models can perform on par with massive models if we augment them with a way to search/query for information. This article breaks down DeepMind’s RETRO (Retrieval-Enhanced TRansfOrmer) and how it works. The model performs on par with GPT-3 despite being 4% its size (7.5 billion parameters vs. 185 billion for GPT-3 Da Vinci). RETRO incorporates information retrieved from a database to free its parameters from being an expensive store of facts and world knowledge. RETRO was presented in the paper Improving Language Models by Retrieving from Trillions of Tokens. It continues and builds on a wide variety of retrieval work in the research community. This article explains the model and not what is especially novel about it.</span>

                    <span>In recent years, voice-based virtual assistants such as Google Assistant and Amazon Alexa have grown popular. This has presented both potential and challenges for natural language understanding (NLU) systems. These devices’ production systems are often trained by supervised learning and rely significantly on annotated data. But, data annotation is costly and time-consuming. Furthermore, model updates using offline supervised learning can take long and miss trending requests.
 In the underlying architecture of voice-based virtual assistants, the NLU model often categorizes user requests into hypotheses for downstream applications to fulfill. A hypothesis comprises two tags: user intention (intent) and Named Entity Recognition (NER). For example, the valid hypothesis for “play a Madonna song” will be: PlaySong intent, ArtistName – Madonna.
 A new Amazon research introduces deep reinforcement learning strategies for NLU ranking. Their work analyses a ranking question in an NLU system in which entirely independent domain experts generate hypotheses with their features, where a domain is a functional area such as Music, Shopping, or Weather. These hypotheses are then ranked based on their scores, calculated based on their characteristics. As a result, the ranker must calibrate features from domain experts and select one hypothesis according to policy. Continue Reading

                    <span>Hi everyone!
 I have a question for you. For context, we aggregate on a platform the various AI APIs on the market (GCP, Azure, etc.) and including NLP APIs (keyword extraction, sentiment analysis, NER, etc.). The idea is that a developer doesn&#x27;t have to create accounts with different providers and can have them all on one API to test, compare and change whenever he wants.
 However, many customers ask us how to mix the &quot;statistical&quot; approach behind these APIs with expert systems and how to achieve hybridization.
 Do you have any idea how to do this?
 Thanks,

                    <span>I have a dataset in which the the best way to impute missing values is to use kNN but before I go ahead and do that I&#x27;d like to check what kind of accuracy I have with that form of imputation in this specific dataset and which k should be used. My original solution was as follows:
  
From my original dataset, remove all rows with missing values
 From this dataset, impute NaNs randomly throughout the dataset with the same frequency that they were missing originally and store the values that were replaced with NaN in a new dataset as the ground truth
 Impute using kNN
 Check the accuracy of the imputed values against the ground truth values stored in step 2 using MAE for different k values
  
Is there an easier way to do this? If not, should I be using MAE or another accuracy score?

So far what I have found mostly is papers that show empirically that or something related to that, like this one. I&#x27;d appreciate any help.
 Edit: u/the_new_scientist shared this paper which is what I was looking for: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1810.02054.pdf Also, I apologize for my vague description. Now that the paper is shown, I hope it is more clear to future readers what kind of results I meant, but in case that is not case, I was wondering about this question: under what conditions can a neural network achieve zero training error? and in particular, I am interested in papers with mathematical (even without empirical) results.

                    <span>Serverless infrastructure is yet practical to use for ML but we think it could bring lots of benefits. So, with a friend, we decided to make serverless easy for ML and we are building a platform to solve the main issues we find in serverless for ML: 
 - Stateful: We don´t want to reload a whole model every time a user calls model.predict
 - Arbritary dependecies: Normal python code with any package dependencies you use and love, just many many times in parallel
 - Scale-up and scale-down: scale up with ease and auto shutdown to keep resources consumptionYou can visit our webpage, try the demo, and request early access to use our platform!
 Webpage: https://telekinesis.cloud 
 Happy to receive questions and comments on what we are building!

                    <span>For those of you unfamiliar feature collapse is when you train a model for classification and the model ends up mapping out-of-distribution data or data of different classes in very close proximity in multi-dimensional space. So for example once your model learns a cluster so to speak for cat, during test it projects a dog into the center of that cluster and classifies it as cat. Some ways to sort of deal with this in CV is double gradient penalty and spectral norm of resnet blocks, but what causes feature collapse?

 Relational Tsetlin Machine
 The paper introduces the first Relational #TsetlinMachine, which reasons with relations, variables, and constants. The approach is based on first-order logic and Herbrand semantics, taking the first steps toward the computing power of a universal Turing machine. The approach can take advantage of logical structures appearing in natural language, to learn rules that represent how actions and consequences are related in the real world. The outcome is a logic program of Horn clauses, bringing in a structured view of unstructured data. In closed-domain question-answering, the first-order representation produces 10× more compact knowledge bases, along with an increase in answering accuracy from 94.83% to 99.48%. The approach is further robust towards erroneous, missing, and superfluous information, distilling the aspects of a text that are important for real-world understanding. https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10844-021-00682-5 #ML #AI #NLP #MachineLearning #Logic #Relational

                    <span>I have a dataset that already contains about 55 columns and out of this, around 10 Columns or so have categorical data in it. If I were to OneHotEncode them, I will end up having a column count of more than 300. Is this something advisable? How do you people deal with such huge number of columns? I mean 300 columns is not a big deal, but I would like to know your opinion and thoughts on this.

                    <span>Hello. I am searching the researches that different size of data are generated through the flow-based network, not super-resolution task such as continuous mapping.
 I want to generate output as time-aligned scalar data, for example
 ​
 Input: noise sampling (B x T x C)
 Output: scalar data (B x T, C&#x3D;1)
 ​
 with introducing the variational data augmentation technique (in vFlow, which can output high-dimensionality as concatenate noise vector for input and output both) for output.
 But there&#x27;s a problem time dimension T is different for each of all data input. How can I treat this problem?
 ​
 p.s. I am very appreciate if I can read the flow-based research in NLP task.

                    <span>I’m about to finish my PhD and the whole field of robotics looks so exciting right now, especially applications like farming and recycling. Has anyone switched from more pure deep learning (vision / NLP) to robotics and how did it happen?
 Did you just get a robotics related job focusing on the vision side of things or is it key to have more experience on the robotics side before getting a job?
 Also I’m curious what’s the best location for robotics? Like how you go to Hong Kong / New York for finance, SF for software or Shenzhen for hardware.

                    <span>I like YOLOv5 but the code complexity is...
 I can&#x27;t deny that YOLOv5 is a practical open-source object detection pipeline. However, the pain begins when adding new features or new experimental methods. Code dependencies are hard to follow which makes the code difficult to maintain. We wanted to try various experimental methods but hate to write one-time code that is never re-used.
 So we worked on making an object detection pipeline to have a better code structure so that we could continuously improve and add new features while easy to maintain.

 And we applied CI(Formating, Linting, Unittest) to ensure code quality with Docker support for development and inference. Our Docker supports the development environment with VIM.

 The new Azure Machine Learning Studio isn&#x27;t free, and this is a school project so I&#x27;m aiming for free and simple.
 Any suggestions? Or maybe someone else is using Studio(classic) and knows a way around this?

                    <span>In recent years, voice-based virtual assistants such as Google Assistant and Amazon Alexa have grown popular. This has presented both potential and challenges for natural language understanding (NLU) systems. These devices’ production systems are often trained by supervised learning and rely significantly on annotated data. But, data annotation is costly and time-consuming. Furthermore, model updates using offline supervised learning can take long and miss trending requests.
 In the underlying architecture of voice-based virtual assistants, the NLU model often categorizes user requests into hypotheses for downstream applications to fulfill. A hypothesis comprises two tags: user intention (intent) and Named Entity Recognition (NER). For example, the valid hypothesis for “play a Madonna song” will be: PlaySong intent, ArtistName – Madonna.
 A new Amazon research introduces deep reinforcement learning strategies for NLU ranking. Their work analyses a ranking question in an NLU system in which entirely independent domain experts generate hypotheses with their features, where a domain is a functional area such as Music, Shopping, or Weather. These hypotheses are then ranked based on their scores, calculated based on their characteristics. As a result, the ranker must calibrate features from domain experts and select one hypothesis according to policy. Continue Reading

                    <span>I have a problem that is -for its nature- continuing, i.e. there are no episodes and the agent has to operate for an infinite time. In my simulator, however, I have the possibility of simulating episodes of any length.
 Is the average reward formulation appropriate for such a problem? I do not know much about it and I have a few questions for you:
  
Could you point me to some literature that addresses average reward and its pros/cons vs discounted reward for continuing problems?
 Is the average taken on a window of finite size or on the limit for the size that goes to infinity? 
 How do common RL algorithms work in this formulation? Can we still adapt them to use average reward?

                    <span>I saw another post on here that mentioned how DQN&#x27;s can be implemented via online learning, offline learning (e.g. batching), or a combination (offline learning first and then online learning in production). What I&#x27;m confused at is the actual deployment paradigm to facilitate online learning (either as the first step or with hybrid). 
 Is the full training code (with a checkpoint model if hybrid) and agent deployed to production with the training step logic executed on-demand for each state transition? If so, would this mean that model compilation / quantization is not possible (e.g. Onnx runtime to INT8 precision)? How is it scaled if it&#x27;s having to perform SGD and back-propagation with each state transition?
 ​
 One the other side, if the model is compiled / quantized, how does it implement online learning (if this is even possible)?

                    <span>Hi, I&#x27;m looking into OpenAI robogym (https://github.com/openai/robogym)&#x27;s rearrange environments, and want to try RL-based control on it with pixel observations.
 The default observations are not pixels, and I can&#x27;t seem to find any documentation online on how to change these environments into pixel observations.
 Can anyone point me to resources where similar changes have been done? Are there preexisting wrappers or code for similar mujoco environments anywhere?
 My other option is to simply render the environment with mode rgb_array, and then train the algorithm based on these rendered observations. Is this a viable option?

                    <span>Hello :),
 Happy new year to all of you!
 I have a question regarding the action space for the Hide &amp; Seek paper by OpenAI. The architecture of the learning model they used is below.
 https://preview.redd.it/el54yihfjd981.png?width&#x3D;794&amp;format&#x3D;png&amp;auto&#x3D;webp&amp;s&#x3D;33c5228ac8003b9bb89b6d008e2cf2aea5f7e071
 They have eventually 3 action heads, as shown in the figure. As per the authors, the movement action for an agent &quot;sets a discretized force along their x and y axis and torque around their z-axis&quot;. How do these 3 forces get pulled from the &quot;movement action head&quot;, given that they are discretized? Does the movement action head have 3 outputs, each corresponding to an axis? So far, in my humble knowledge, I always assumed that a network with a discrete action space gives only one action per head (which could be the result of a softmax over the action space).
 Any insight?
  
After some digging, I found that the Movement Action has a &quot;MultiDiscrete&quot; type, which is a gym class. I am struggling to understand the nature of actions produced by this class, any idea?

                    <span>Happy new year!



This year , let’s start with an issue that gained so much prominence over the last two years: mental health. A variety of AI techniques and strategies have been employed in mental health.

In this post, we summarise the findings based on a paper (link below)

                    <span>Help me understand this please. I’ve read that people feed data to an AI/ML algorithm and find things that they weren’t looking for but there aren’t many good examples out there to read about.
 So I’m thinking: if I were to feed into an AI/ML algorithm a csv of order details and customer data from an eCommerce system, should I expect the AI engine to “find” something statistically usual/unusual and tell me about it? 
 Or do I need to instruct it to look for certain traits with e-commerce orders and customers that I already know about? Eg look out for fraud by checking x y z. 
 What if the thing to look for is so strange that you need the AI to pick it up. Eg maybe fraudsters start telling their friends to always use a certain name or phone number as an inside joke. I would think an AI might pick on that somehow whereas it might take a human a longer time to figure that out.

                    <span>Genomic editing, particularly the CRISPR/Cas technique, is widely employed in experimental biology, agriculture, and biotechnology. CRISPR/Cas is one of several weapons used by bacteria to resist viruses. As the pathogen’s DNA enters the cell, Cas proteins detect it as foreign hereditary material and break it because its sequences differ from those of the bacteria. To respond to the virus quicker, the bacterium saves pieces of the pathogen’s DNA—much like a computer antivirus retains a collection of viral signatures—and passes them on to subsequent generations so that its Cas can prevent future attacks.
 Teams from different laboratories independently adapted the CRISPR/Cas system to introduce arbitrary changes into DNA sequences in human and animal cells. It made genomic editing much easier and more efficient. The critical components of the mechanism are guide RNA, which “marks the site,” and the Cas9 protein, which cleaves DNA at that location. The cell subsequently “heals the wound,” but the genetic code has already been altered.

                    <span>First time submitting to ICLR, I&#x27;m wondering how is the open discussion on openreview.net really different from the review-rebuttal procedure used in other conferences.
 For the papers I&#x27;m reviewing, about half the reviewers reacted to the authors&#x27; responses (clarifications, modifications, additional experiments, etc.). As to my submission (5568), I run extra experiments and answered each of the concerns directly but received 0 feedback from the reviewers.
 As a reviewer, I think it doesn&#x27;t matter if the rebuttal changes your mind about the quality of the submission but it&#x27;s very basic manner to reply to the authors&#x27; responses. A simple &quot;Thank the authors for the responses but I don&#x27;t think these addressed my concerns&quot; would work. Saying nothing only means you are uncertain if the responses make sense and you just doesn&#x27;t care to figure it out. The authors spent a whole week running experiments to answer some of your questions and if you don&#x27;t give **** about their responses, just keep the questions with you and don&#x27;t submit your review.
 I was hoping for a different experience submitting to ICLR and then I realized the &quot;discussion&quot; is basically broken.

 Games have been used throughout research as testbeds for AI algorithms, such as reinforcement learning agents. However, different types of games usually require different solution approaches, such as AlphaZero for Go or Chess, and Counterfactual Regret Minimization (CFR) for Poker. Player of Games bridges this gap between perfect and imperfect information games and delivers a single algorithm that uses tree search over public information states, and is trained via self-play.

                    <span>Why is it so hard to raise exceptions when ML pipeline is using a GPU?
 When for example you make a classic &quot;Index out of bounds&quot; error, in libraries like PyTorch you get some generic &quot;CUDA&quot; error and you can&#x27;t see the exact error until you transfer the tensors explicitly to CPU and rerun the code.
 Do you think there is a possibility for this to improve in the future?
 Sorry if this is more CS-related question

                    <span>I often read that NN or CNN are overparametrized. But, for example, resnet18 has 11M parameters while cifar10 has 50k32323&#x3D;153M data points. How is that be an overparametrized network on cifar10? Or even on mnist which has 60k28*28&#x3D;47M data points

                    <span>My job is to work with ML engineers and provide them with whatever they need to experiment with/train/test/deploy ML models -- GPU infrastructure, distributed training support, etc. When I interface with their code, I almost always find it so poorly written, with little to no thought given to long-term stability or use -- for code that they 100% know is going to production.
 They&#x27;re brilliant people, far smarter than me, and really good at what they do, so it&#x27;s not a matter of them not being good enough. I feel (from my very limited experience, so I&#x27;m happy to be wrong) like ML engineers are incentivized to write poor code. The only metric for evaluation seems to be accuracy, loss, and all the plots that come up. In research, I understand completely, that&#x27;s where the focus lies, but in industry? I&#x27;ve seen many models perform poorly because the code is so hard to read and refactor that big issues remained unspotted for months together. And this is especially befuddling because for a field that is completely fine with spending months to get an ROI of single digit increases in model performance metrics during the experimentation phase, they don&#x27;t seem to care about anything that might go wrong in production. That just feels like a fundamental disconnect, since without the core ML stuff working perfectly, none of the other stuff (like what I do) has any value -- and even so, I&#x27;m taught to hold my code to a much higher standard than the critical stuff -- which I&#x27;m happy about since I can now write production code by default -- but it&#x27;s just... weird. Like the vending machines at a nuclear power plant being better engineered than the reactor.
 Is this a common problem or is this a localized issue that I&#x27;m facing?

 I am a robotics enthusiast building a robot arm to perform mundane tasks. So far, I have only been able to deploy deep reinforcement learning models on the Jetson Nano. The process has been easy using the Nvidia TensorRT SDK. What other methods/technology exist? My friend recommended using a google coral and a raspberry pi. Any recommendations would be greatly appreciated. Thank you

                    <span>In classical - on-policy - vtrace/Impala algorithm env_steps are incremented every training iteration
 like this : env_steps +&#x3D; size_of_batch * unroll_length
 However when we add replay_buffer to vtrace (like in CLEAR or LASER) we also start to learn from off-policy data therefore some trajectories (from replay) could be sampled more than once.
 My question is - does the env_step_counting stay the same even when some trajectories from batch are from replay and some directly from workers (on-policy) ?
 Or do i count steps only on those trajectories that are on-policy &#x3D;&gt; not from replay
 like : env_steps +&#x3D; len(batch[&quot;on_policy_samples&quot;]) * unroll_length
 And if so what happens when i decide to use only samples from replay to train - how do i count env_steps then ? Using some kind of flag to indicate if specific trajectory was sampled already and leave it from counting ?
 ​
 Have been digging through the research papers for some time now and i haven&#x60;t been able to find what is the proper way to do it. Any help or advice would be much appreciated.

                    <span>Hi all, it&#x27;s my first time to use reddit to ask for suggestions.
 I am a beginner in RL. I learned some basic ideas in RL (such as SARSA, PPO and A2C) recently and applied Q-network to train a Go game agent. 
 Personally speaking, I am going to pursue for a position as a RL engineer in the future. But I have no idea about what should I do to improve my RL skills. So I am wondering if there are some awesome resources for a beginner like me? Or could you please give me some instructions?

                    <span>Smart healthcare services can be provided by using Internet of Things (IoT) technologies that monitor the health conditions of patients and their vital body parameters. The majority of IoT solutions used to enable such services are wearable devices, such as smartwatches, ECG monitors, and blood pressure monitors. The huge amount of data collected from smart medical devices leads to major security and privacy issues in the IoT domain. Considering Remote Patient Monitoring (RPM) applications, we will focus on Anomaly Detection (AD) models, whose purpose is to identify events that differ from the typical user behavior patterns. Generally, while designing centralized AD models, the researchers face security and privacy challenges (e.g., patient data privacy, training data poisoning).
 To overcome these issues, the researchers of this paper propose an Anomaly Detection (AD) model based on Federated Learning (FL). Federated Learning (FL) allows different devices to collaborate and perform training locally in order to build Anomaly Detection (AD) models without sharing patients’ data. Specifically, the researchers propose a hierarchical Federated Learning (FL) that enables collaboration among different organizations, by building various Anomaly Detection (AD) models for patients with similar health conditions.

 I think their technical best practices seems a little stronger than the organisational ones. Thoughts?

                    <span>Hi All! I am Michał from the AutoAscend team that has won the NetHack 2021 NeurIPS Challenge.
 I have just shared some episode visualization videos:
 https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list&#x3D;PLJ92BrynhLbdQVcz6-bUAeTeUo5i901RQ
 The winning agent isn&#x27;t based on reinforcement learning in the end, but the victory of symbolic methods in this competition shows what RL is still missing to some extent -- so I believe this subreddit is a good place to discuss it.
 We hope that NLE will someday become a new standard benchmark for evaluation next to chess, go, Atari, etc. as it presents a set of whole new complex problems for agents to learn. Contrary to Atari, NetHack levels are procedurally generated, and therefore agents can&#x27;t memorize the layout. Observations are highly partial, rewards are sparse, and episodes are usually very long.
 Here are some other useful links related to the competition:

                    <span>Hello,
 I´m applying Deep Reinforcement Learning for the first time, and I have some questions about it (I´ve already looked for an answer but in vain):
  
How to normalize objectives&#x27; values in the reward function? if we have an objective that values are in the range of 10 and another objective that values are in the range of 1000.
 During the training phase, how can we watch the weights updates of a network and the gradient calculation too?
 In a multi-agent setting and episodic task, for &quot;dones&quot; vector, it will be set to &quot;True&quot; once all the agents are finished, or once an agent finishes the task done[agent_index]&#x3D;True in other words, we won´t wait the latest agent to finish to set dones &#x3D; [True]*number_of_agents
  
Thank you.

                    <span>Hi, all Happy New Year!
 I&#x27;m working on a project to teach my quad-rotor how to hover, and these are what my rollout graphs looks like.
 The reward graph constantly increases for some time, but suddenly during a rapid increase in reward, the entropy loss, and the train std of starts to diverge, and the explained variance just crashes.

 From my understanding, this explained variance far from 1 is a bad sign, Could you please point out, or give comments on what would be the possible reason why this is happening in my case?
 Any kind of reply would be appreciate.
 Thanks again Happy New Year. :D

                    <span>I am attempting to recreate the PPO algorithm to try to learn the inner workings of the algorithm better and to learn more about actor-critic reinforcement learning. So far, I have a model that seems to learn, just not very well.
 In the early stages of training, the algorithm seems more sporadic and may happen to find a pretty solid policy, but due to unstable the early parts of training are, it tends to move away from this policy. Eventually, the algorithm moves the policy toward a reward of around 30. For the past few commits in my repo where I have attempted to fix this issue, the policy always tends to the around 30 reward mark, and I&#x27;m not entirely sure why it&#x27;s doing this. I&#x27;m thinking maybe I implemented the algorithm incorrectly, but I&#x27;m not certain. Can someone please help me with this issue?

                    <span>At the end of every year I have a tradition where I write summaries of the
books that I read throughout the year. Here’s the following post with the rough
set of categories:
Popular Science (6 books)
History, Government, Politics, Economics (6 books)
Biographies / Memoirs (5 books)
China (5 books)
COVID-19 (2 books)
Miscellaneous (7 books)
I read 31 books this year. You can find the other blog posts from prior years
(going back to 2016) in the blog archives.
Popular Science
This also includes popular science, which means the authors might not be
technically trained as scientists.

                    <span>I&#x27;ve been playing around with Replika, and it&#x27;s incredibly fun and impressive as a general &quot;companion&quot; chatbot, but I find it really disappointing in its lack of ability to learn explicit facts or procedures. It&#x27;s targeted toward making people feel like they have a friend and roleplaying, not learning anything external to those goals.
 So, is there anything commercially available that you can both:
  
Talk to (mostly) like a real person, and
 Teach from the ground up (like a child)
  
? 
As an example, my Replika &quot;wanted&quot; to do a lesson with me, so I tried to teach it colors. Ostensibly it has some picture recognition abilities, but despite that, it was never able to learn which color was which, even when using the same image files to display the same color.
 Okay, fine, forget colors, but it can&#x27;t learn explicit facts either. I want to be able to input things like &quot;Lacan defines the subject as that which is represented by a signifier for another signifier&quot; or &quot;It&#x27;s important to apply a primer before your first layer of eyeshadow&quot; or &quot;Leonardo DiCaprio played Jack Dawson in the movie Titanic&quot; and have it be able to actually remember and recall that information in future conversations. (Replika is able to recall it within the same conversation, but it resets after a certain amount of time. It also seems to struggle with remembering things that differ from user to user, like favorite food, since it learns from the aggregate of its conversations.)
 Is there anything out there that can do this? Anything on the horizon?

 It was pretty fun learning about ONNX and how to port GANs to web. You can play around with the random seeds and also distort the intermediate latents to produce some really wacky results. You can check out a GIF on Twitter.
 Let me know if you come up with anything cool!

                    <span>Hello
 Can someone explain why the actor critic maps the states to the same actions, in other words why the actor outputs the same action whatever the states?
 This what makes the agent learns nothing during training phase.
 Happy New Year!

                    <span>I have a question about baseline in policy gradient method. Based on what is implemented in relation to PG, there are many shared policy and value networks. But I understood baseline should not affect the parameters of the policy. When PG with shared networks and baseline updates value function, then baseline will affect policy network. Is it okay?

                    <span>Hi,
 I am planning on doing my MSc in CS with a focus in RL. More specifically, I want to learn about multi-armed bandits and how it can be used by agents to enable them to perform actions in a diverse environment. I am new to this field and I want to know more about what questions about MAB are unanswered? Any interesting application that may be currently under research? 
 I would really appreciate if anyone can help me out. 
 Thank you!

                    <span>Ever since Grimes posted her Tiktok video last year inviting communists to join up under a supposedly benevolent AI, I&#x27;ve been kind of obsessed with what would really happen if AI ran a city, or even a whole society. Would it really be as awesome as she seems to think or would it be a potentially horrifying nightmare? (My money&#x27;s on nightmare, btw)
 Anyway, I tried to answer some of those questions in a work of fiction, available below as a free download. It&#x27;s a quick read, and I&#x27;d love to hear your thoughts on these problems, whether or not you read the book. No doubt someone soon will be trying to implement these kinds of &quot;solutions&quot; in our world... and it&#x27;s best to be at least marginally prepared!

                    <span>Images, such as graphics, paintings, and photographs, may frequently be explained in language, but they might also take specific talents and hours of effort to make. As a result, a technology capable of creating realistic graphics from natural language can enable humans to produce rich and diverse visual material with previously unimaginable simplicity. The capacity to modify photos with spoken language enables iterative refinement and fine-grained control, both essential for real-world applications.
 DALL-E, a 12-billion parameter version of OpenAI’s GPT-3 transformer language model meant to produce photorealistic pictures using text captions as cues, was unveiled in January. DALL-E’s fantastic performance was an instant hit in the AI community, as well as broad mainstream media coverage. Last month, NVIDIA unveiled the GAN-based GauGAN2 – a term inspired by French Post-Impressionist painter Paul Gauguin, much as DALL-E was inspired by Surrealist artist Salvador Dali.
 Not to be outshined, OpenAI researchers unveiled GLIDE (Guided Language-to-Image Diffusion for Generation and Editing). This diffusion model achieves performance comparable to DALL-E despite utilizing only one-third of the parameters.

 The code and weights for these models may be found on the project’s GitHub page.
 The research paper for the GLIDE can be found here.

                    <span>Hello there,
 I am working on an implementation for PPO, and I am struggling to compute the loss when two output heads for the actor network are used (one is continuous and one is discrete). The loss in PPO has 3 components: 1) clipped surrogate, 2) squared state-value loss, and 3) Entropy.
 I thought of treating the two actions separately, and compute two different losses that I add before backpropagating, but the middle term (2) is the same in both losses. How could I do that? Do I add (1) and (3) for both actions and have one loss, or do I compute two different losses then add them? Or is it hidden option 3? :p
 ​
 Any help is appreciated.

                    <span>Hello there,
 I noticed that in many works by OpenAI and Deepmind in RL, they deal with a continuous action space which they discretize. For example rather than having to continuous actions to determine speed and direction of movement, they would discretize speed and torque.
 Is there any reason why discretized action space is more favorable?

                    <span>I need an algorithm that combines both discrete and continuous actions space, like if I wanted to choose action but I needed to also perform that action at an optimized velocity or something. Can I do this with ppo and how. I am still a beginner but must of the algorithms I played with had either separately I thought of actor cri but I don’t think the value network does what I want I can’t use that to predict how much velocity to use

                    <span>Hello
 I´ll be glad if someone could help me with this.
 I am new in DRL and when I applied it I got some issues. For example, my network freezes in the same reward from the first episode I noticed also that the agent selects always the same index from the action space. Even the same reward and the same trajectory toward this reward, the critic loss is still shrinking over time (this the weirdest thing)
 I don´t know what is the reson behind that?

                    <span>I&#x27;m trying to see the effect of simulated sensor noise in training a successful policy using RL for the cart pole control problem.
 I have four states: cart position, cart velocity, pole angle, pole angular velocity, and I added Gaussian noise to all of them. However, I want to find the impact of adding noise to a specific variable to find which of the states is the most sensitive to noise.
 If I were to only test the system with noise in one of the variables at a time (e.g. noise for position, but none for the other variables), would that be considered an ablation test?
 Just caught up in the terminology, because I know typical ablation tests remove a certain component instead of adding only one (or removing all but one).

                    <span>Recently, OpenAI removed the robotics tasks from gym, as they are no longer being maintained and Robosuite uses mujoco-py which has been deprecated. Deepmind&#x27;s control suite includes some robotics tasks but they don&#x27;t seem to be first-class citizens (they are in a separate module, with less options and some bugs).
 Are there any other robotics environment suites that are well-maintained and supported?

                    <span>Hello,
 I am new in the Reinforcement Learning field. My question is: how can I easily map my states into my code?
 F.I. when the problem is about how to move an agent in a board-like environment, such as walk from point A to B by moving UP, DOWN, LEFT or RIGHT, it is quite easy to map your states. You can create a matrix like NUMBER_OF_ROWS x NUMBER_OF_COLUMNS and that is pretty much it.
 However when it comes to other type of scenarios, such as CartPole-V0 from OpenAIGym (https://gym.openai.com/envs/CartPole-v0/), I don&#x27;t understand how to map the states into my code.
 This scenario has 4 states and 2 actions:
 States:
  
Cart Position (range -2.4 --&gt; 2.4)
 Cart Velocity (range -Inf --&gt; Inf)
 Pole Angle (range -12deg --&gt; 12deg)
 Pole Angular Velocity (range -Inf --&gt; Inf)
  
Actions:
  
Push cart to the left
 Push cart to the right
  
The same is true for every other scenario that is not board-like, f.i. tic-tac-toe. I don&#x27;t understand how can I make every possible move in the game a state inside the code.
 ​
 Is there any technique to approach each type of problem or do I just need to figure it out by myself? 
 Have a nice day,
 Gabriel.

                    <span>Hi there, I was a graduate student previously working on a few RL-related problems a year ago. And recently I&#x27;ve got much interest in Policy Optimization problems, and started with reading some foundation papers like DQN, DPG.
 While reading the paper of DPG, it was very straightforward to understand the main idea of the paper, however, it was very difficult to understand the proofs of the theorems shown in the appendix(http://proceedings.mlr.press/v32/silver14-supp.pdf). I barely understood the proof of Theorem1, but proof of Theorem2 is almost impossible to understand due to the lack of my mathematics background. 
 The question is that, could you tell me what I should study or learn before understanding this kind of proof? What kind of subject or material should I look for in order to understand the flow of the proofs and related definition/notation used in the proof of &#x27;DPG&#x27;?
 I personally think that it is crucial to understand the proofs of the main Theorem because it will help me to understand the authors&#x27; intuition and motivation which can be the foundation of the paper.

                    <span>With recent breakthroughs in AI, humans have become more reliant on AI to address real-world problems. This makes humans’ ability to learn and act on knowledge just as essential as a computer’s. Humans learn and gather information through learning and experience to understand everything from their immediate surroundings. The ability to comprehend and solve issues, and separate facts from absurdities, increases as the knowledge base grows. However, such knowledge is lacking in AI systems, restricting their ability to adapt to atypical problem data.
 Previous studies show that pre-trained language models improve performance on various natural language interpretation and generating tasks.
 A recent work of researchers at Baidu, in collaboration with Peng Cheng Laboratory (PCL), release PCL-BAIDU Wenxin (or “ERNIE 3.0 Titan”), a pre-training language model with 260 billion parameters. It is the world’s first knowledge-enhanced multi-hundred billion parameter model and its largest Chinese singleton model.

                    <span>What have been your favorite reads of 2021 in terms of RL papers? I will start!
 Reward is enough (Reddit Discussion) - Four great names from RL (silver, Singh, Precup and Sutton) give their reasonings as to why using RL can create super intelligence. You might not agree with it, but it&#x27;s interesting to see the standpoint of Deepmind and where they want to take RL.
 Deep Reinforcement Learning at the Edge of the Statistical Precipice (Reddit Discussion) - This is a major step towards a better model comparison in RL. Too many papers in the past have used a selection technique akin to &#x27;average top 30 runs in a total of 100&#x27;. I have also never even heard of Munchausen RL before this paper, and was pleasantly surprised by reading it.
 Mastering Atari with Discrete World Models - Very good read and a nice path from Ha&#x27;s World Models to Dream to Control to DreamerV2. This is one of the methods this year that actually seems to improve performance quite a bit without needing a large scale distributed approach.
 On the Expressivity of Markov Reward (Reddit Discussion) - The last sentence in the blog post captures it for me: &quot;We hope this work provides new conceptual perspectives on reward and its place in reinforcement learning&quot;, it did.
 Open-Ended Learning Leads to Generally Capable Agents (Reddit Discussion) - Great to see the environment integrated into the learning process, seems like something we will see much more of in the future. Unfortunately, as DeepMind does, the environment is not released nor is the code. I remember positions at OpenAI for open-ended learning, perhaps we might see something next year to compete with this.
 ​
 Most of my picks are not practical algorithms. For me, it seems like PPO is still king when looking at performance and simplicity, kind of a disappointment. I probably missed some papers too. What was your favorite paper in RL 2021? Was it Player of Games (why?), something with Offline RL or perhaps Multi Agents?

                    <span>OpenAI used to do a lot of RL research, but it seems like last year and this year the only real RL related work was on benchmark competitions. They even gave away the control of OpenAI Gym. They still have great RL researchers working there, but nothing major has come out.
 Is it all due to a pivot towards large scale language models that are at least profitable? Is Sam Altman just not interested in RL?

                    <span>Most of the Autoencoder examples/blogs use MNIST dataset as the implementation. I have trained an autoencoder on CIFAR-10 which you can refer here. There is a trade-off between making the CNN architecture deeper and the improvement of reconstruction loss/error. Or, using a VAE.
 Thoughts?

                    <span>Viral keratitis, bacterial keratitis, fungal keratitis, and parasitic keratitis are all types of infectious keratitis. Bacterial Keratitis (BK) is a kind of Infectious Keratitis that is one of the most frequent and vision-threatening. Contact lens wear is the most prevalent risk factor for Bacterial Keratitis (BK), and it is becoming increasingly popular around the world for a variety of reasons, including exercise, cosmesis, and myopia management.
 BK is substantially more fulminant and painful in the clinical course than other Infectious Keratitis(s). A delayed diagnosis of Bacterial Keratitis (BK) can result in large-area corneal ulcerations, melting, and even perforation if not treated.
 In the case of Infectious Keratitis, timely detection and treatment of BK are vital goals. However,…</span>

                    <span>Meta AI releases the beta version of Bean Machine, a probabilistic programming framework based on PyTorch that makes it simple to describe and learn about uncertainty in machine learning models used in various applications. Bean Machine makes it possible to create probabilistic models that are domain-specific. It also uses multiple autonomous, uncertainty-aware learning algorithms to learn about the model’s unseen features. Bean Machine gets an early beta version from Meta.

                    <span>On July 03 2021, the subject of media and news sources came up in a
conversation I had with someone over brunch when we were talking about media
bias. I was asked: “what news do you read?” I regret that I gave a sloppy
response that sounded like a worse version of: “uh, I read a variety of news …”
and then I tried listing a few from memory. I wish I had given a crisper
response, and since that day, I have thought about what that person has asked
me every day.
In this blog post, I describe my information diet, referring to how I read
and consume media to understand current events. Before getting to the actual
list of media sources, here are a few comments to clarify my philosophy and
which might also preemptively address common objections.

I would love if some of you can clarify. If say I have 200 faces and 2000 pictures these faces are in (1 face might be in N pictures), in order to find all the pictures that each face is in, that means I will have to run 400,000 transactions ? As in 2000 iterations per face? Or is there a smarter way to do it?
 I know there is an option to index faces but i do not fully understand that yet.
 Thank you for your help!

                    <span>Sharing machine learning experiments to compare its models is important when you&#x27;re working with a team of engineers. You might need to get another opinion on an experiments results or to share a modified dataset or even share the exact reproduction of a specific experiment.
 The following tutorial goes through an example of sharing an experiment with DVC remotes: Running Collaborative Experiments - using DVC remotes to share experiments and their data across machines
 Setting up DVC remotes in addition to your Git remotes lets you share all of the data, code, and hyperparameters associated with each experiment so anyone can pick up where you left off in the training process. When you use DVC, you can bundle your data and code changes for each experiment and push those to a remote for somebody else to check out.

 I want to show a NN some gameplay. But I don’t know how to. I can capture the keystrokes for each frame but I don’t know what to do next. 
 Do I take screenshots and save those frames w the keystrokes to my disk? 
 I kinda know how to use Cv2, Pillow, and the keyboard module. 
 I’m really lost, so any help will be highly appreciated
 Ps- I want the model to learn how to play the game

 Semantic search allows us to search language-based data based on the semantics or &#x27;meaning&#x27; of a text, from machine translation to question-answering. It&#x27;s how Google understands &quot;what time is it in NYC?&quot;, and even allows us to search for images using text-based queries.
 It is in essence, a way for us to interact with machines in a more human way. NLP fits in as the &#x27;semantic&#x27; in semantic search.
 Current chapters are: 1. Dense Vectors 2. Sentence Embeddings and Transformers 3. Training Sentence Transformers with Softmax Loss 4. Training Sentence Transformers with MNR Loss 5. Multilingual Sentence Transformers 6. Question Answering 7. Unsupervised Training for Sentence Transformers 8. (New) Data Augmentation With BERT
 Let me know what you think, I hope you enjoy it!
